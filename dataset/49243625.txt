== Early and personal life ==
Joshua Alexander White was born on May 25, 1973.  He is the pastor of Door of Hope in Portland, Oregon, where he resides with his wife, Darcy.
Josh White was an active singer/ songwriter in the Seattle Scene before recording Christian music. He was in the bands Marble, Medicate and Man Ray before going solo in 1999, and then moving to Portland with Darcy and starting Telecast in 2002.


== Music career ==
Josh started singing and writing music when he was just 12. He was in the band Marble, releasing a self titled album in 1995. He got a big break with his band Man Ray with the album "Casual Thinking" recorded at AVAST! studios in Seattle and released on Mercury Records in 1997. The label pushed Hansen instead of ManRay.
They played many, many shows all over Seattle and Portland. With a Huge local following, but no real label backing ManRay went on hiatus, and then Josh had Medicate and played a ton of shows, but did not record, although AVAST! has unreleased songs by Josh.
After a regrouping, and marrying Darcy, he recorded his first solo album "Coming Undone" released in 1999 on Emperor Records. Moving to Portland he changed direction, went back to his Christian roots and began his Christian band Telecast. Josh is still the frontman for the Christian rock band Telecast. Much later in 2010, he released a second solo album, Achor, that was released on November 9, 2010, by BEC Recordings. He released, Absolution, on November 23, 2013, with Deeper Well Records.
