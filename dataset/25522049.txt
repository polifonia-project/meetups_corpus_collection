Brian Gilbert Greenway (born October 1, 1951 in Hawkesbury, Ontario) is a Canadian guitarist, vocalist, and harmonicist, most notable for playing in the Canadian rock bands April Wine, Mashmakhan, and the Dudes. Greenway has been performing with April Wine from 1977 to 1986 when the band split, and again from 1992 to the present day.After April Wine broke up in 1986, Greenway embarked on a solo career and recorded Serious Business which continued the traditional April Wine mix of heavy rockers and ballads. It is often said that Greenway is responsible for giving April Wine a "harder edged" sound.In 2016, Greenway formed Brian Greenway's Blues Bus with former April Wine bandmate Gary Moffet (guitar/vocals), along with Craig Miller (harp/vocals), Mark Higden (drums), and Lloyd Dallaire (bass).

In 1991, Greenway became the subject of his own hour-long TV special entitled Brian Greenway and Friends. The show featured Greenway and his ensemble of friends (keyboardist Jimmy Tanaka, guitarist Jeff Smallwood, bassist Jeff Nystrom, supporting vocalist and percussionist Nanette Workman, and former Mashmakhan/April Wine drummer Jerry Mercer) performing songs from both his 1988 solo project and April Wine catalogue. This In-Concert special was video-taped live in Laval, Quebec by CFCF-Channel 12 Montreal, and broadcast nationally by CTV-Canada on August 7, 1991, and February 15, 1992.
