== Biography ==
Creme was born in Prestwich, Lancashire, England. Like bandmates Graham Gouldman and Kevin Godley, Creme grew up in a Jewish household.  While attending art school in Birmingham, he took up the nickname Lolagon and met Kevin Godley. They joined white R&B combo The Sabres (The Magic Lanterns), Hotlegs and other bands together, most significantly 10cc, and in 1976 they left 10cc together to record as Creme & Godley (later Godley & Creme). The pair became music video directors, working with bands including Yes. 
Creme directed the 1991 Jamaican comedy film The Lunatic.
In 1998, Creme became a member of the band Art of Noise, with Anne Dudley and Trevor Horn, and directed videos for the artists who recorded with them, such as Tom Jones. Further work with Horn followed, including forming the band The Producers (now known as The Trevor Horn Band) with Chris Braide and Steve Lipson.
