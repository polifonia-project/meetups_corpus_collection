Edsel Gomez (born August 9, 1962) is a Puerto Rican jazz pianist. In 2007, he was nominated for a Grammy Award for the album Cubist Music. He arranged and directed Dee Dee Bridgewater's Grammy-winning recording Eleanora Fagan (1915-1959): To Billie with Love from Dee Dee Bridgewater. He has worked with Jack DeJohnette, Don Byron, Brian Lynch, and Eddie Palmieri.
After a research study promoted by the Philippine Heritage Library and Ayala Museum in Manila, Philippines, he began the Edsel Gomez World Fusion Band, which explores the fusion of Philippine traditional and tribal music with jazz and Afro Caribbean music.
