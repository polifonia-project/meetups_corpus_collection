Born and raised in Philadelphia, Bob Marcucci started in the music industry at age 25, as a songwriter, and subsequently borrowed $10,000 from his father to launch Chancellor Records.
He signed Frankie Avalon as one of his first acts, but by the time Frankie had reached the age of 19, his appeal as a recording artist had begun to wane and Marcucci was in need of a new star.
His next act was his neighbor's 14-year-old son. Marcucci's neighbor had suffered a heart attack, after which Marcucci went to help the family. He spotted the neighbor's young son and after the father had recovered, inquired as to whether the youngster would be interested in a career in music. Fabian initially declined but, because his family needed the money, eventually signed on as Marcucci's next act. After two years Fabian bought out his contract.Marcucci was the long-time manager of Hollywood gossip columnist Rona Barrett. He was co-producer of the 1984 version of The Razor's Edge, starring Bill Murray in a rare dramatic role. The following year, he produced A Letter to Three Wives for television.
