=== Rick James ===
After hearing "Got To Give It Up" by Marvin Gaye and knowing that the session was produced by Stewart, Rick James was interested in him. As a producer, James found him to be modest and easy going, and with his work in the studio, he saw a flair that he had not seen before. James said that with the subtle suggestions that he made for the positioning of the horns or changes to the bass line, he was just the man he needed.
He co-produced Rick James's 1978 Come and Get It which was released in April 1978. According to James, Suzanne de Passe said that he couldn't have made a better choice to use Stewart.
