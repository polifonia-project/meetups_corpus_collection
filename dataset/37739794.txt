== Biography ==
Aarum was educated at Agder Musikkonservatorium, Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, before he headed for Oslo in 1998. His jazz talent impressed the Oslo jazz community, and he was a popular collaborator within several bands, while he continued studying at Norges Musikkhøgskole and graduated with the thesis Stiltrekk som skiller den nordiske jazzen fra den afro-amerikanske.
He led his own Anders Aarum Trio to the debut album Lucky strike (2000) accompanied by Mats Eilertsen (bass) and Torstein Ellingsen (drums). It was followed up with Absence in mind (2004), where Ellingsen was replaced by Thomas Strønen. The third album of the Trio, First communion (2006), included Ole Morten Vågan (bass) and Andreas Bye (drums).
Aarum is also involved in FAQ (Fossum-Aarum Quartet) together with the brothers Håvard (saxophone and flute) and Jens Fossum (bass). The drummer Jarle Vespestad is the last but not least member of the crew. F.A.Q. was nominated for the 2007 Spellemannprisen in the class Jazz, for their debut album Frequently Asked Questions (2007). He is also regular pianist in the band Funky Butt. Otherwise, he has collaborated on releases with Per Høglend, Randi Tytingvåg, Sølvi Hansen, Ola Kvernberg, Majken Christiansen, Tine Asmundsen, Sigurd Køhn, Sonny Simmons, Børre Dalhaug, Hilde Louise Asbjørnsen, Jazzmob, Nora Brockstedt and Even Kruse Skatrud.
