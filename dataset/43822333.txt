Henderson was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She was the niece of Eva Taylor and Clarence Williams.As a child, she performed in minstrel shows and on the vaudeville circuit. In the late 1920s, she recorded around ten songs, which were issued by Brunswick Records and QRS Records. In 1927, she starred in Bottomland, an ill-fated New Yorkâ€“based stage musical written by Williams. The show included the song "Take Your Black Bottom Dance Outside", which Henderson recorded. In 1928, she married John Jackson.Henderson continued performing until 1944, long after her recording career was over.According to Derrick Stewart-Baxter, Henderson's vocal style was marred by "more than a suspicion of ham", as "she put her material across in a rather lachrymose manner".She was unrelated to Fletcher, Horace, Edmonia, and Rosa Henderson.
