Jeff Scott Soto (born November 4, 1965) is an American rock singer of Puerto Rican descent. He is best known for being the vocalist on Yngwie Malmsteen's first two albums, and (briefly) the lead vocalist for Journey in 2006–2007. Soto also sang lead vocals in the band Eyes. He also had a long tenure as the front man of hard rock band Talisman. Currently he works as solo artist, with his self-named band SOTO and as the vocalist of super-groups W.E.T., Sons of Apollo and  Trans-Siberian Orchestra.
His style ranges from hard rock to power metal, being influenced by classic soul singers as Sam Cooke as well as Journey's Steve Perry, and Freddie Mercury of Queen.


== Career ==
In 1982, after performing in several local cover bands, Soto recorded several songs as lead singer for the band Kanan. In 1984, Soto provided vocals for virtuoso guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen's debut album Rising Force and his next album Marching Out a year later.
Soto has performed with a wide variety of bands, including Panther, Axel Rudi Pell, Eyes, Talisman, Takara, Humanimal, Human Clay, Kryst The Conqueror, Redlist, The Boogie Knights, Soul SirkUS and Octavision. As a session musician, Soto also performed backing vocals for artists such as Lita Ford, Steelheart, Glass Tiger, House of Lords, Stryper, & Saigon Kick.
He also sang for the fictional band Steel Dragon, which featured Zakk Wylde, Jeff Pilson and Jason Bonham for the soundtrack of the movie Rock Star along with Michael Matijevic of the band Steelheart, whose second album featured Soto on background vocals.
Soto performed at the 2000 annual OIQFC 'Freddie Mercury Birthday Party' at Reading in the UK, where he performed "Dragon Attack" with Brian May. Since then, Soto has joined Queen sideman Spike Edney's band, the Spike All Stars. Soto then appeared with Brian May and Roger Taylor at the 'Hollywood Walk of Fame' bash for the Official International Queen Fan Club. In 2012 Taylor hired Soto as one of the four singers chosen for the official tribute band Queen Extravaganza. The band was formed via internet auditions and features Freddie Mercury soundalike Marc Martel. Soto and singer Yvan Pedneault were added to the lineup to augment the selected singers, in an effort to better emulate Queen songs live. However, Soto only did one tour with the group; they continued with a smaller production and line up
Soto's solo album Damage Control was released on Frontiers Records in March 2012. His next solo album SOTO was released on January 30, 2015. The album was co-written alongside Gus G and other members of his solo band. The solo project soon morphed into a band called SOTO. In 2016, they released DIVAK on earMusic. They toured afterwards, opening for Winery Dogs in May 2016.
In 2015, Soto recorded vocals for Joel Hoekstra's 13, contributing to the album Dying to Live. Soto split vocal duties with Russell Allen on the album.
In 2018, SOTO recorded their 3rd album Origami, released in May 2019.Soto released another solo album, Retribution in November 2017. In early 2020 he completed work on his 7th solo album as well as scheduled a live album for release in July.
2020 sees the release of 2 solo albums on Frontiers Records, "Jeff Scott Soto - Loud & Live In Milan 2019", recorded live at the annual Frontiers Rock Festival and "Wide Awake (In My Dreamland)" co-written and produced by Alessandro Del Vecchio.


=== Talisman ===
Soto was one of the founding members of Talisman in 1989. He was in the group up until their disbandment in 2007.
Talisman regrouped in December 2019 to record a tribute track for  bassist Marcel Jacob on the 10th anniversary of his death.


=== Journey ===
In 2006, Soto replaced Steve Augeri in Journey after Augeri left the tour due to an acute throat infection. After months of being a tour replacement, Soto was officially hired as the band's singer in December 2006. However, the stint was short-lived, as he was fired from the band on June 12, 2007. Soto stated on his website "it seems they wanted something different than I brought to the table. No love lost though, they know what's best for the preservation of their legacy." He later mentioned the gig didn't work out because former vocalist Steve Perry was still alive and could hypothetically rejoin the band, hurting fan expectations of any replacement singers. Although he was officially introduced as the lead singer of Journey, the band has not mentioned Soto in recent lookbacks and biographies, skipping over him entirely for his replacement Arnel Pineda.


=== Trans-Siberian Orchestra ===
Soto joined Trans-Siberian Orchestra as a touring singer in 2008. Soto has continually toured with the group, stating "I will be a part of Trans-Siberian Orchestra as long as they'll have me."


=== W.E.T. ===
Alongside members of Work Of Art and Eclipse, Soto founded W.E.T. The group, named after the initials of the band involved, Soto's representing Talisman, released a self-titled debut album in November 2009. In 2013, they released their second album Rise Up, and their third studio album Earthrage followed in 2018.
They began recording a new album in 2020.


=== Sons of Apollo ===
In May 2017, he joined a progressive metal supergroup named Sons of Apollo with Derek Sherinian, bassist Billy Sheehan, drummer Mike Portnoy and guitarist Ron "Bumblefoot" Thal. Their debut album, Psychotic Symphony, was released Oct 20, 2017 with Inside Out/Sony.
After releasing a live album in 2019, Sons of Apollo released their second album MMXX in January 2020.


=== Octavision ===
In 2020, alongside his Sons Of Apollo co-bandmate Billy Sheehan, Soto was invited by a Glendale, California based Armenian guitarist Hovak Alaverdyan to participate in his progressive metal project Octavision. There, Soto performed vocal duties on two tracks - "Coexist" and "Apocalyptus". The album titled Coexist was released on 29th December 2020.


== Personal life ==
Soto was born in Brooklyn, New York, his family moved to Los Angeles when he was a child. He spent his youth singing, learning trumpet and keyboards.
In 2012, he married his long-term girlfriend Elena. He has a son from a previous marriage, and two step-children.
