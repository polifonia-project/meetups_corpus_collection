== Early career & TV ==
While in college in 1988, Joseph founded MJM Entertainment Group, coordinating recording sessions for Japanese bands and producing documentaries for Japanese TV networks NTV, NHK, and Fuji TV.  Joseph has worked steadily as a TV Talk show host and correspondent for a variety of media outlets. In 1992 when the co-host of the Group W broadcast, The Wow Wow Entertainment Report, decided to take a sabbatical to star in a film, Joseph was chosen to fill in on a temporary basis. What was to have been a two-month engagement turned into a full-time position when the network appointed Joseph as co-anchor of the broadcast. Soon afterward, the program was acquired by CNN and Joseph continued to anchor the program for CNN. In 1994 the show was not renewed and Joseph turned his attention to creating a pilot for a culturally relevant political/pop culture talk show for CNN called Culture Clash which he hosted and produced. Although the show was not picked up, later that year Joseph began producing and hosting another talk show for Japan's NHK Network called The Interview. Set in Los Angeles, the program featured one on one interviews with American cultural icons like CNN's Larry King, providing a window into American society for millions of Asian viewers. After three successful seasons, the show was re-christened LA Frontline and ran for two additional seasons. Joseph continues to host and produce talk shows, most recently the Bully! Pulpit show, an online talk show that features Joseph interviewing newsmakers for his news blog site, Bullypulpit.com
