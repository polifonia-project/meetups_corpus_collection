8 Eyed Spy was an American no wave band from New York City, consisting of Lydia Lunch (ex-Teenage Jesus and the Jerks and Beirut Slump) and Jim Sclavunos (also ex-Teenage Jesus and Beirut Slump), Michael Paumgardhen, Pat Irwin and George Scott III.


== Background ==
8 Eyed Spy played their first New York City show in October 1979 at the Mudd Club.
 Subsequently, AllMusic qualified 8 Eyed Spy as "a far more overtly musical group than Teenage Jesus and the Jerks".They covered Bo Diddley's "Diddy Wah Diddy", the swamp rock classic "Run Through the Jungle" by Creedence Clearwater Revival and Jefferson Airplane's "White Rabbit". The band recorded only briefly, releasing one live album, Live, and a self-titled studio album. The band broke up in 1980 after the death of George Scott III.
