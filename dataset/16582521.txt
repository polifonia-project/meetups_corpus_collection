He was the musical director there for 12 years.  During this time, he released the album Larry Novak Plays! on Dot Records, issued in 1964 with Count Basie bassist, Cleveland Eaton. Novak accompanied on piano, conducted, and arranged for Peggy Lee and worked extensively with Pearl Bailey; he also accompanied on piano, conducted, and arranged for Mel Tormé, Frank Sinatra, Joe Williams, Sarah Vaughan, Tony Bennett, Natalie Cole, and Carmen McRae.
