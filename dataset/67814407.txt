Swarobanjo (also spelled as Swarbenjo or Swarbanjo) is a Rajshahi based Bengali 'folk fusion' music group formed in 2014. The group is known for its folk music, original musical ideas, the use of indigenous musical instruments in concerts, and live performances. In 2014, Swarbanjo started performing as a music group with Yamin Iskra Rahman, Maisha, Ragib Niaz Rafi, and Asif Hasan Niloy, students of Rajshahi University. The group is open for others to join as a member. In 2015, they released their debut album 'Gan Bajna'. They later released 'Hawar Chithi' in 2016 and several other solo songs.


== History ==
Yamin Iskra Rahman, the main initiator of the formation of Swarobanjo, has been practicing music since childhood. In 2014, he studied law at Rajshahi University and practiced piano, tabla, and Hawaiian guitar. At that time, the writer Sadat Hossain wrote a song titled 'Boy of the Last Bench' on his Facebook and opened it for others to make music on it. Iskra sings Rafi's song and holds it in his ventricular voice. Through this song, they started performing as a music group. The group first performed directly to the university and various crowds under the name Nikhil Bangla Ukulele Sangha. The band's name was later changed to a more appropriate name. On the advice of former member Raunak Hassan Rono, the group unanimously adopted the name Swarbanjo. Swarbanjo released their first studio album in 2015 titled 'Gan Bajna' since the formation. Their second album 'Hawar Chithi' came in 2016. In 2016, the group performed at the Dhaka International Folk Music Festival, which is the group's first performance in an international event.


== Features ==
The group distributes their albums free of charge under the Creative Commons license rather than the commercial release.


== Members ==
Swarobanjo's group membership is open to everyone, although some members perform regularly for the group.
