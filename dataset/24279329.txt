== History ==
Hailing from Jackson, Tennessee, Ash came to Nashville chasing the music of his heroes — Kenny Chesney, Garth Brooks, and Jerry Lee Lewis. He quickly landed in the studio as the first recording artist signed to Broken Bow Records imprint, Stoney Creek, and began making music with the man behind Chesney’s hits, producer Buddy Cannon. From Buddy, Ash learned that writing and finding good songs is the key to any successful music career. This lesson would serve Ash well as he eventually moved into the producer’s chair himself.
Bowers signed to Stoney Creek Records, a sister label to Broken Bow Records, in June 2009. In August 2009, Bowers released his debut single "Stuck", written by Frank J. Myers and Billy Montana. It debuted at No. 60 on the U.S. Billboard country singles charts dated for September 19. Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave a favorable review, saying that he could identify with the song's theme of wanting to leave a small town and adding, "Even if somebody doesn’t leave that hometown they feel ‘stuck’ in, they certainly can use this song as a weekend party anthem". His debut album was to have been produced by Buddy Cannon. Two more singles were released from the project: "Ain't No Stopping Her Now" and "I Still Believe in That", but the album was never released.
Ultimately, Ash decided to focus on his songwriting and soon found success with Keith Urban, Montgomery Gentry, Dustin Lynch and Randy Houser all recording his songs. Ash then co-founded Wide Open Music, a publishing and management venture with his friend, Steve Williams.
In 2016, Ash took fellow songwriter Jimmie Allen under his wing, and signed him to Wide Open Music before helping Jimmie land a record deal at Ash’s former label home, Stoney Creek. Together, they began writing and recording songs that would form the basis of Jimmie Allen's debut album Mercury Lane., which Ash co-produced with Eric Torres. The lead single from that project, “Best Shot,” hit No. 1 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart for three weeks in November 2018, one month after Mercury Lane was released. "Make Me Want To", the second single off of Mercury Lane, also reached number 1 on both media base billboard country airplay charts. 
In addition to brokering the recent partnership between Wide Open Music and global publishing powerhouse, Sony/ATV, Ash is also serving as manager, producer and music publisher for breakthrough country artist Matt Stell. Stell’s single “Prayed for You”, co-written by Ash, was the only debut single to reach number 1 on the billboard chart in 2019.
Songwriter, manager, and producer Ash Bowers has taken the lessons he’s learned and relationships he’s forged since moving to Nashville and parlayed them into one of the most unique and diverse careers Music Row has seen in years.
