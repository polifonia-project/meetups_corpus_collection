Dario Seixas Filho (born March 11, 1971) is a rock bass player, who most recently played with the multi-platinum band Jack Russell's Great White.  He has also toured with the hard rock band Firehouse and recorded their 2003 release Prime Time. He has been credited by the Brazilian media as the first Brazilian musician to play in a top hard rock band. Seixas has also toured with metal legend Stephen Pearcy of RATT, and is a current member of the bands Goodbye Thrill and Crown of Thorns. His stage presence and bass tricks have earned him the reputation of a "not to miss" performer.


== Early years ==
Dario Seixas was born and raised in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The son of Dario Seixas and Suelly Motta Seixas, Seixas started playing bass at age 14, inspired by the performance of rock band KISS at his home town in 1983.
He studied three years of music theory at the Brazilian Conservatory of Music of Rio de Janeiro and had lessons with multiple bass teachers. At age 17 he decided that he needed to move to the States in order to play hard rock, which was not popular in Brazil at the time. At 19 he sold everything he had and followed his dreams to America.
