== Biography ==
He attended Scoil Lorcáin and Coláiste Eoin, which is a Gaelscoil on Dublin's southside, although he credits his father as being the main influence for his love of the Irish language, of which he is a fluent speaker. He won an under-18 all-Ireland award for his skills on the bodhrán. Ó Maonlai first formed a band called The Complex with childhood friend Kevin Shields and drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig.  After Liam left to form the Hothouse Flowers in 1984, Shields and O'Ciosoig were joined by vocalist Dave Conway and keyboardist Tina (who used no surname), and renamed themselves My Bloody Valentine, taking their name from a low-budget horror film.
Ó Maonlaí is also an active member of the Nuclear Free Future movement and contributed to the hosting of events in Carnsore and in Wexford Town in 2001. In 2004 he was a guest at the Barefoot College, located at Rajasthan, India. In 2005 he released a solo album entitled Rian which is a collection of tunes and songs in Irish. He performed in the 2009 Dublin to Gaza benefit concert.
The 2008 documentary Dambé: The Mali Project tells the story of his 3,000 mile cross-cultural musical adventure with Paddy Keenan and friends, and features performances from the Festival au Désert.
