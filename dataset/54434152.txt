== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Sophie was born on 2 December 1998 in 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands but she used to live in St Francis Bay, South Africa, for a big part of her childhood. She moved to Sint-Oedenrode, Netherlands later with her parents. From an early age, she had an interest in music. By the age of 9, she started playing piano and singing along to many songs. At the age of 14, she had to do a school project at the International School of Eindhoven (ISE) where she should develop a new skill during 9 months, and being so much into the music, she got inspired to do something with it for this project. Besides that, she also wanted to do something with people. When doing research she found a video of a DJ playing a live set who had a great connection with the crowd. As she loved the vibe and was amazed by how one person can transfer his energy to an entire crowd with music, she realized that "when you are a DJ, you have this special connection with people, I think that's amazing!". She went to a music school in Eindhoven, where she began taking DJ lessons and met new friends who already began producing music, kicking off her career two years before her graduation, achieved on 19 May 2017.
