John Dhani Lennevald (born 24 July 1984 in Stockholm) is a Swedish songwriter, record producer, and formerly a Pop/R&B dancer and singer.  He was a member of the Swedish pop band A*Teens from 1998 to 2004, and briefly pursued a solo recording career after the band dissolved.


== Career ==


=== A-Teens (1998–2004) ===
In 1998, at the age of 14, Lennevald signed a record deal with Stockholm Records (part of Universal Music Group) along with his then band mates, Sara, Marie and Amit. Together they performed as the A-Teens. In 1999, they released their first single, a cover of the legendary band ABBA, Mamma Mia. The single topped the charts in Sweden for 8 consecutive weeks, and the success was similar around the world.
By 2000, the A-Teens' first album, The ABBA Generation had sold 4 million copies, and they became one of the most successful Swedish bands around the world.After 6 years together and more than 9 million albums sold, the A-Teens parted ways after their Greatest Hits album and their final tour together in Sweden.


=== Solo career ===
After the A-Teens went their separate ways in 2004, Dhani chose to return to the studio in order to write and record new songs. "Girl Talk" is the introduction to Lennevald's solo career. The record company freely admits that there hadn’t been much speculation surrounding a solo career for Lennevald. On the contrary, most of the questions regarding solo careers have centred on the girls in the band.
Lennevald approached the record company with five new songs, just one and a half weeks after the end of the tour. Lennevald's driving force in delivering songs of such quality and in a relatively short space of time impressed everyone concerned.
Lennevald created a new sound, assisted by producer Peter Björklund, in which his voice is the prime focus. His first release was the single, "Girl Talk", a kind of tragicomedy about the inability of men to really understand what their girlfriends are trying to say to them.
The video for "Girl Talk", directed by Mikeadelica, was filmed in a sunny Stockholm day, during the middle of August. Also involved in the song and the video were Denmark’s biggest rap artists, Nik & Jay.
"Girl Talk" was unleashed on radio on August 12, 2004 getting high rotation on the most important radio stations in Sweden, the single, was released on September 15, 2004 and reached #20 on the Swedish Charts and earned a Gold Certification weeks later.After the release of his single, Lennevald started to work as a model, appearing in several fashion magazines and participating on Fashion Shows in his native Sweden.
Several rumours have been circulating among his fans about Lennevald releasing another single. He said he was recording an album in New York and some tracks were ready to go, although nothing has been confirmed.
In 2005 Lennevald and Universal Music parted ways, and there is no word about another record deal. Also in 2005, a song clip called "Let's Do It Again" leaked on the Internet and Lennevald appeared on shows in Sweden promoting his image and new songs.
Since then, Lennevald works as a music producer and songwriter and co-operated with Måns Zelmerlöw, Anton Ewald and Carl Falk.
