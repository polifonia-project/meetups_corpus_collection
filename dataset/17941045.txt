Dennis Thompson (born September 7, 1948) is an American drummer, most famous for being a member of the 1960s–70s Detroit proto-punk/hard rock group MC5, which had a No. 82 US single with "Kick Out the Jams" and a No. 30 US album with the same name.
Thompson was given the nickname "Machine Gun" because of his "assault" style of fast, hard-hitting drumming that sonically resembles the sound of a Thompson machine gun (commonly referred to as a "Tommy Gun"). His drumming pre-figured and influenced punk, metal, and hardcore punk drumming styles.After MC5 broke up, Thompson was a member of the 1975–1976 Los Angeles-based supergroup The New Order, the 1981 Australia-based supergroup New Race, The Motor City Bad Boys, and The Secrets. In 2001, he guested for Asmodeus X on the song, "The Tiger" (St. Thomas Records).Thompson was in the band DKT/MC5 with the surviving members of MC5, from 2003-2012.
