== Career ==
Regina, who majored in theater at Marymount Manhattan College, began her music career in the late 1970s, recording and performing with the new wave band Regina Richards and Red Hot. The band regularly played New York City music venues such as CBGB, Max's Kansas City, and Irving Plaza. With the help of Richard Gottehrer, the band  signed with A&M Records. The first single released was titled "Tyger," with "Tug of War" as the B side. The second single "Don't Want You Back," with "Company Girl" as the B side, was followed by a self-titled album; the records did not attain mainstream success. Subsequently, she dissolved the group and focused on writing songs for other artists and helping them record demos with Stephen Bray, her former Red Hot drummer. One of the artists who approached them was Madonna, who was trying to secure a recording deal at the time; Regina helped Madonna with vocal harmonies on her demos.In 1986, Regina and Bray co-wrote "Baby Love," initially planning on selling it to Madonna or another artist. Her record label, Atlantic Records, however, requested that Regina sing the song herself. The single reached #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 that year and was included on Regina's Curiosity album, which also included "Say Goodbye," a song she had originally written with Kenny Rogers in mind. Another song from the album appeared on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart that year: "Beat of Love." Music publications of the time often commented on perceived similarities to Madonna, and called her the "queen of the wanna-bes."In 1987 she appeared in an anti-drug public service announcement with McGruff the Crime Dog that aired well into the 1990s. In 1988, Regina released the song "Extraordinary Love." It reached #11 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. In 1990, no longer with Atlantic, she released her final single "Track You Down."In 1991, Australian singer Dannii Minogue released a cover of "Baby Love" as a single, reaching #14 in the UK Singles Chart.
