Author of significant Venezuelan waltzes and joropos, he also had a strong predilection for the merengue caraqueño. Some of his most popular songs are Al poeta, Criollísima, Golosinas criollas, El saltarín, El tramao, Mi merengue, Nathalia, Serenata, S.O.S. and Un heladero con clase, among others.Laguna died in 1984 at his home of Maracay at the age of 58, following complications from diabetes.
