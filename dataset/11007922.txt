The group was influential on the Korean music scene, famous for their single, "Nan Arayo" (Korean: "난 알아요", "I Know"). The group received criticism for various albums, most notably for the song, "Shidaeyugam" (Korean: 시대유감, "Regret of the Times"), to which the fan backlash led to the abolishment of the Pre-censorship law in 1996.
