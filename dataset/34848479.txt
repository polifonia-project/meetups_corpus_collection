Ahrre Maros, sometimes Arpie Maros, (born February 3, 1960) is a Hungarian-American coffee entrepreneur based in Westfield, New Jersey who is notable for managing two widely attended concert series in the northern New Jersey area for charitable purposes. He hosts the Coffee With Conscience music series which mostly features singer-songwriters, as well as the Powerful Women of Song series which hosts female performers. The concert series support local charities including the Keith Knost Special Needs Trust. Artists are paid either a flat fee or a percentage of ticket sales, and the rest of the money is donated to charity; over the past dozen years, tens of thousands of dollars have been raised annually. In addition, he owns and manages several coffee shops in the north Jersey area; his coffee shops in Westfield and Summit were cited by New Jersey Monthly magazine for their quality.
