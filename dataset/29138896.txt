She was heard at that house later that year as Rosina in Gioachino Rossini's The Barber of Seville. She was then heard in the title role of Giuseppe Verdi's Aida at La Scala, and during her time in Milan studied singing further with the conductor Antonio Votto. She was soon heard at the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris as Santuzza in Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. After further engagements in the French provinces, she became a member of the National Theatre, Oslo where she remained active for the rest of her career.
