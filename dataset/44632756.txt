Violet Chachki's style is characterized by their "obsession with vintage glamour". They have been referred to as "the living embodiment of a 1950s female archetype" and have cited designers Christian Dior, Thierry Mugler and John Galliano as inspirations, as well as "style icons" such as Lady Miss Kier, Dovima, Dita Von Teese, and Raquel Welch.The influence of fetish fashion and art is a staple in Chachki's aesthetic, with references to the bondage and latex subcultures, John Willie's illustrations, dominatrix imagery and Bettie Page. They told Design Scene in 2016: "I think drag in itself is kind of a fetish, it’s kind of uncomfortable and I think bondage and latex are uncomfortable and they have that same feel... I think especially when you’re really feeling it and feeling your look and you’re willing to suffer through the pain to kind of present yourself the way you want to present... I think that’s kind of a fetish. I think it’s exhibitionism almost." Chachki is known for their tightly laced corsets.
