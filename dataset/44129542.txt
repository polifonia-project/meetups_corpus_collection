PM Satheesh established Scuba Location Sound, painstakingly putting together high end location sound equipment and a dozen freelance sound recordists working under his guidance. This set up allowed Scuba to record location sound for documentaries and television where there was hardly any time for post dubbing.Braving all logistical nightmares PM Satheesh used Pro Tools on location in the Himalayas for a multi track hard disk based recording for the Tibetan feature film Dreaming Lhasa.
P.M Satheesh is working for S.S Rajamouliâ€™s Baahubali, scheduled to have been released in April 2015. Regarding his experience with the film, he said "Baahubali is one of the very few films in South where a lot of importance is being given to sound recording. We dropped the idea of shooting with sync sound since the dialogue delivery has to be modified accordingly. The sound design team embeds various types of micro-phones throughout the set to record the ambient sound, which will lend a natural feel to the film. It's necessary, because some of these sounds aren't available in the market. It's quite a challenge for everyone".
