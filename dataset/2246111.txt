Lucas Fox is an English drummer who was, a founding member, of British rock band Motörhead and London punk rockers Warsaw Pakt.


== Motörhead ==
In 1975 Fox picked up Lemmy from London airport after he was sacked from Hawkwind. Lemmy, Fox and Larry Wallis started a new band, Bastards. After taking advice from their manager Doug Smith, the band was renamed Motörhead. The band started by supporting Greenslade at the roundhouse on 20 July performing cover versions except Motörhead (Lemmy), On Parole and City kids (Larry Wallis). Fox was the drummer for six months before being replaced during their first album at Rockfield Studios, Monmouth, Wales, recording sessions by Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor. Fox's drumming appeared on the On Parole album track, "Lost Johnny" which, unlike the rest of the songs Fox recorded for the album, were not overdubbed with Taylor's drums.Lucas also appeared in the band's 10th anniversary video in 1985, joining the band on stage for the final number, "Motorhead", at Hammersmith Odeon, London.


== Warsaw Pakt ==
In Spring 1977, Warsaw Pakt formed around Ladbroke Grove, London, composed of lead guitarist Andy Colquhoun of The Rockets, Fox on drums, vocalist Jimmy Coull, John Walker on rhythm guitar, and Chris Underhill on bass. The band gigged around local venues and played with Siouxsie and the Banshees at a gig in the bar of Exeter College, Oxford, Oxford. Their debut album Needle Time was released through Island Records. 5,000 copies were sold in the first week, at the end of the week Island Records decided they would not have any more pressed. The band continued to play locally for a few months more before finally splitting up in March 1978.

After the breakup of Warsaw Pakt, Fox played for a brief time with the band Walking Wounded. In 1982 he was in the band The Spy's and they released one album that year. Band soon split up. Fox was also one of the many drummers The Scientist employed between 1985 and 1986, of Civilisation Machine in 1985, and worked on Andrew Eldritch's side-project The Sisterhood.
In the late 1980s, Fox moved to France and ended up as technical director and programming director of the Midem festival, Cannes, France in 1986, 1987 and 1988, programming artists like James Brown, Al Jarreau, Kim Wilde, and Véronique Sanson.

These events were responsible for the international success of bands such as the Gipsy Kings, Mory Kante, Cheb Khaled, Mano Negra, Les Satellites, Pigalle.
