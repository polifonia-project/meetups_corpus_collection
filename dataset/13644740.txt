After the 2009 release of De Rosa (band)'s second album Prevention (album), Henry's solo album The Other Half of Everything was released in the UK on 10 October 2011 on Gargleblast Records.

The List gave it 4/5, calling it "impressive" and "thoughtful". The Skinny called it "marvellous stuff", praising both the songwriting and the touches of electronica. Journalist and critic Andrew Collins named it number 27 in his best albums of 2011.After his album, Henry released Live On Land EP. A collection of live recordings from Henry's European acoustic tour, it was recorded over a number of performances in September 2012. As the quality varies, it was only ever released as a "Pay what you like" downloaded on Henry's bandcamp page.In 2015, Henry released On The Forest Floor as a collaboration with Gillian Fleetwood (State Broadcasters), under the guise of Henry & Fleetwood. The EP consists of four tracks.
