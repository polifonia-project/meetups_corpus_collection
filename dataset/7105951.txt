Richard Steven Burmer (September 19, 1955 â€“ September 9, 2006) was an American composer, engineer, sound designer, musician and ethnomusicologist. His work with electronic music combined with musical styles and instruments from around the world formed his own unique and distinct sound.


== Early life ==
Richard was born September 19, 1955 in Owosso, Michigan, the son of Henry Stanley Burmer and Theresa (Suchozenka) Burmer. As a youth growing up in Michigan, he was introduced to the music of India, the Middle East, contemporary orchestral composers, and electronic music. He found a wide palette of musical textures with synthesizers, and the original sampler, the Mellotron. Influences also came from The Moody Blues, King Crimson, and Pink Floyd. He graduated from Corunna High School in Michigan.


== Career ==
After spending time in college studying music theory and composition, Richard moved to Los Angeles where he became a sound designer for E-mu Systems in Santa Cruz and engineer/synth programmer for EFX systems in Burbank.
Richard Burmer died of heart disease on Saturday, September 9, 2006 in Saginaw, Michigan at the age of 50 years. A 2007 Hearts of Space radio show episode entitled "Across the View" (Program #794) was dedicated to his memory. The radio show Echoes released a tribute podcast for Burmer on the tenth anniversary of his death in 2016.
