=== Criticism ===
Pianist and musicologist Charles Rosen rebutted Beethoven and the Construction of Genius in an article "Did Beethoven Have All the Luck?" in which he challenges DeNora's assumptions by insisting that we do indeed know many if not most of the works of Beethoven's contemporaries; that many have been analyzed, revived and recorded; and that they do not approach Beethoven's originality, breadth of thought, or structural sophistication. Even with this criticism, a blurb was pulled from it for the back cover of DeNora's book.
