McLeod's 2017 album, Rocky's Diner showed a departure from the familiar rock persona by exhibiting her song writing versatility and allowing her favoured rock and roll influences to shine through.
In 2018 McLeod launched her own lifestyle clothing line, Bad Valentine, describing the brand as being, “dedicated to the celebration of self confidence, empowerment and freedom of speech.”
During the initial stages of COVID-19 lockdown in Melbourne Victoria, March 2020, McLeod performed a live-streaming solo set on her social media.  The set was from her “Killin' It Till I’m Dead” tour which was cancelled due to social distancing restrictions.  Sarah McLeod utilised this performance to formally launch “McLeod's Wolfpack” - an online community and social club.
McLeod relocated to Queensland during Victoria, Australia's COVID-19 lockdown of 2020, allowing her to be one of the only Australian artists to continue touring live during the second half of 2020.  McLeod completed her One Electric Lady solo tour across Australia in March 2021, during which she performed sets on both guitar and piano for live audiences.


== Early life and family ==
Sarah Yvette McLeod, was born on 1 February 1973, to parents Don and Rosemary. She grew up in Adelaide with her older sister Leah McLeod (born 1971), a former television presenter.McLeod attended St Peter's Collegiate Girls' School and began singing in her late teens. In 1990 she commenced a university course, doing a Bachelor of Arts at Flinders University in Adelaide. 3 months into the course she went on a holiday with friends to Bali, where she was invited to join a Balinese band. She enjoyed playing on stage and performed with the band every night during her visit. McLeod later remembered "I could already play a bit of guitar by then but did little more than sing and play to my buddies at home." Upon her return to Adelaide, armed with a new passion for performing, she quit university and formed her first group, Fallen Down Monster. She displayed her vocal and guitar skills, and fun-loving, energetic stage presence. Fallen Down Monster performed indie band covers, and McLeod wrote original tracks which were not recorded.


== Career ==


=== The Superjesus ===

Late in 1994 she joined Chris Tennent to form an indie guitar rock band, Hell's Kitchen, which later became The Superjesus. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane described McLeod's "captivating voice and melodic rhythm guitar." In May 1996 the group issued their debut four-track extended play, Eight Step Rail, with all the tracks co-written by McLeod with her bandmates. Jonathan Lewis of AllMusic noticed McLeod's singing: "Sounding like a cross between Liz Phair and Catatonia's Cerys Matthews, McLeod's voice was a major drawcard; strong, confident and rarely lapsing into the girlishness that characterized some of The Superjesus' contemporaries."At the ARIA Music Awards of 1997 the Superjesus won Best New Talent and Breakthrough Artist – Single for Eight Step Rail. Then released their first full-length album, Sumo (June 1998). The group released two more albums, Jet Age (October 2000) and Rock Music (May 2003), before they split in 2004.
