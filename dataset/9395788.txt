== Biography ==
An alumnus of the independent The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, Boswell studied English literature at Pembroke College, Cambridge. Playing the guitar since age 12, he was an accomplished guitarist and was signed by Transatlantic Records in 1975 whilst still at college. This led to the release of his first solo album, "The Mind Parasites", a collection of contemporary acoustic songs and instrumentals.
He formed the band "Advertising" in 1977, at the beginning of the punk rock era. Labelled "Power Pop," the band was more of an homage to the pop art style of Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground. They toured extensively with Blondie.
After the split of "Advertising", Boswell became a record producer both in the United Kingdom and Italy. He produced Italian mega star Renato Zero's album, which became the biggest selling Italian album of all time.  Boswell's record productions from the 1980s have influenced many contemporary musicians, notably the sample of the band 23 Skidoo's "Coup" which became The Chemical Brothers' "Block Rockin' Beats". After producing two albums for the London band Live Wire, he joined the band.

Boswell's film career started in 1985, and since then he has countless awards from around the world and has been nominated twice for a BAFTA award.

Established as a live performer as well as working in recording studio, he is accomplished with electronic and rock genres, combining these with epic orchestral scores.
