Werner Knudsen (born 23 October 1953) in Ringsted) is a Danish computer scientist, composer and author of both choral music and IT books. He is an IT architect at IBM and used to work at TDC A/S. He lives in Glostrup close to Copenhagen.

He has primarily composed songs as well as choral and organ music, notably in collaboration with author Niels Johansen. Hvem kaldte på erantis?, a collection of their songs and hymns, was published at Unitas Forlag in 2010. His Sommersange, a choral cycle with lyrics by Thøger Larsen, has been published at Edition S in 2008.
