== Musical career ==


=== 1996–2004: Héctor & Tito ===
Tito and his partner released a number of hit songs in their native Puerto Rico, including "Amor de Colegio" (ft. Don Omar), "Felina", "Baila Morena" (ft. Glory), and "No Le Temas a Él", a song which not only raised their popularity, it helped raise popularity for the then up-and-coming Trebol Clan. After years of working together, they separated, but not before releasing a final album, Season Finale, which featured some of their greatest hits. The duo broke up due to Tito's belief of disloyalty from Hector.Héctor & Tito released their first album in 1998. Together they became reggaeton stars after releasing several successful albums and making appearances in several compilations. They became one of the most sought-out duos in the genre. Both became the first reggaeton artists to sell out a massive concert in Puerto Rico, opening the path to other artists such as Tego Calderón, Daddy Yankee and others.


=== 2004–2006: Solo career and Top of the Line ===
After much delay, his first solo album was released, Top of the Line. The album was a hit, reaching No. 1 in Puerto Rico.
Top of the Line featured 20 new songs, with collaboration from artists such as Daddy Yankee, Don Omar and Beenie Man. It featured quite a number of hits, such as "Caile", "Mía" (ft. Daddy Yankee), "Tu Cintura" (ft. Don Omar), "Flow Natural" (ft. Beenie Man and Deevani) "Secreto", "Máximo", "Tuve Que Morir" and "Me Da Miedo" among others.

"Siente El Boom" is also on Chosen Few II: El Documental featuring Randy.In Top of The Line: El Internacional, the remix features Randy, along with his partner Jowell, & De La Ghetto. The second single recently released, "Enamorado", did not get a lot of airplay as "Siente El Boom" was still a hit on Puerto Rico's radio stations. "Siente El Boom" expanded throughout Latin America, peaking at No. 14 in the Billboard Hot Latin charts.
