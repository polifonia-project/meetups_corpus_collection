== Life and career ==
Trotignon was born near Paris in 1974. He started playing the violin at the age of 6 and the piano three years later. His first solo piano album was 2003's Solo. Trotignon composes music and plays "interpretations of music from Led Zeppelin and [Bob] Dylan to Edith Piaf".


== Playing style ==
The Daily Telegraph's Ivan Hewett wrote on the originality of Trotignon's style in 2009 that "Any references are only subliminally present in a style that's very much his own. He has certain favourite devices such as rapid-fire repetitions of single notes, and machine-gun alternations of the hands".The Guardian's John Fordham, commenting on a Trotignon duo concert with percussionist Minino Garay stated that the pianist's playing contained "startling chordal exclamations, plaintively romantic lyricism and [...] a collage of liquid lines and stuttering drumlike invitations to his partner".
