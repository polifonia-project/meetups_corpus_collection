== Life and career ==
Born in Jesup, Georgia, United States, Bramblett studied religion and psychology at the University of North Carolina, with the objective of entering the seminary.  However, finding inspiration in the music of James Taylor, Carole King, and Bob Dylan, he abandoned his theological studies and pursued songwriting, soon moving to Athens, Georgia.
After establishing himself as a session musician in the early 1970s, recording with artists like Gregg Allman and Elvin Bishop, Bramblett toured with bands such as the Gregg Allman Band, Sea Level, Widespread Panic, and Traffic. Bramblett, along with Chuck Leavell, has been credited with giving Sea Level, described as "a jazz-influenced spinoff from the Allman Brothers Band," a new, unique direction. Bramblett has been described as an outstanding lyricist and vocalist. The songs he wrote during his time with Sea Level have been described as "philosophical, despairing soul and funk tunes and rockers."As of 2017, Bramblett has recorded a total of fourteen albums, with the first two, That Other Mile and Light of the Night, issued by Polydor in the 1975 and 1976, and multiple albums in each succeeding decade. Bramblett's 2001 album, No More Mr. Lucky, features Bramblett playing the Hammond B-3 and saxes. Tracks on that album has been described as rich, funky, hip, and raw.In 2015, Bramblett released Devil Music. The title track was inspired by the story of Howlin' Wolf trying to reunite with his estranged mother, who had abandoned him for "playing the devil's music."
