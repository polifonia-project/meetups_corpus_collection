Nikos Mihas (Greek: Νίκος Μίχας; born November 20, in Athens, Greece) is a Greek singer-songwriter of the new age of Greek rock stars.


== Early life ==
From an early age he showed an interest in music. He started by playing the piano at the age of 10 and a few years later he formed a band with his brother and some friends. The band was called "NIMA" (derived from the first letters of their names, NIkos-MAkis). Some years later he went to Romania to study Medicine and become a doctor. He never left his dream however, which was to become a singer, so he entered the TV talent show "Fame Story 2".


== Fame Story (2004) ==
In 2004, he decided to take part in the talent show "Fame Story 2", shown on the Greek TV channel ANT1, where he was one of the favourites to make it to the finals due to his unique style of performing and his low-profile character. One week before the final, however, he was eliminated from the show but for the first time in a Greek talent show he performed a song that he wrote; a move that many other contestants followed in the years to come. "Party" was a huge success at the time, even without being physically released in the music market.

In March 2007 his second album "Trehei Tipota?" was released. It contains 12 songs in a rock-alternative style including some beautiful ballads.
