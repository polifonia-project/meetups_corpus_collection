George Masso (November 17, 1926 – October 22, 2019) was an American jazz trombonist, bandleader, vibraphonist, and composer specializing in swing and Dixieland. Masso is notable for his work from 1948–1950 as a member of the Jimmy Dorsey band.Masso was born in Cranston, Rhode Island, United States. Masso began learning to play the trumpet, but expanded his diversity by becoming competent on other instruments.  He was further inspired by hearing Lou McGarity playing trombone on Benny Goodman's recording of "Yours". Masso secured a two year spell in the late 1940s in Jimmy Dorsey's band, before finding the life of a professional jazz musician financially difficult, and Masso quit performing. He became a music teacher.He returned to music in 1973 and performed with Bobby Hackett and Goodman. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he recorded with Barbara Lea, Bob Haggart, and Yank Lawson.
