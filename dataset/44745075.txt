He started performing at the age of 12 and sang with the American rapper Issa Dina when he was just 16. With his friends, he formed a hip hop formation called KDM (Killer du Microphone) in South of France. Moving to Deuil-la-Barre in 1995, he was associated with the A.R. Possee group and later at 15, Kaotik.
His association in the hip hop collective Comité de Deuil and his meeting with Tunisiano resulted in created the character Personnalité Suspecte and thanks to his skills in ragga hip-hop, he became a noteworthy part of the collective with M Group piece "9.5.1.7.0."
In 1997, he became part of the hip hop group Sniper with musical event FrancoFolies in La Rochelle. Sniper included Blacko in addition to Tunisiano (Bachir Baccour), Aketo (Ryad Selmi) and initially DJ Boudj. The group mixed rap, reggae and songs in its repertoire. DJ Boudj left after the initial two albums, Du rire aux larmes (2001) and Gravé dans la roche (2003). With Dj Boudj leaving, the remaining trio had two more albums Trait pour trait and À toute épreuve in 2006. A final tour in 2007 would mark the end of Sniper.

Immediately upon break-off of Sniper in 2007, he was featured in French rapper Soprano's hit "Ferme les yeux et imagine toi". This gave him great exposure as a solo artist.

In 2010, he released his 17 track album Enfant du soleil independently online, explaining his fall-off with Desh Musique and his musical orientation for ragga and reggae. This created further legal problems with the label through the courts. End of 2011, he released an EP of 5 title under the title Instin Kaf made available for free downloads.
