Thomas "Zeke" Zettner (September 21, 1948 â€“ November 10, 1973) was a member of rock band The Stooges.  Zettner had originally been a roadie for the band, but replaced original Stooges bassist Dave Alexander after the Fun House album (1970) until the end of 1970. Jimmy Recca soon replaced him as bass player.  Alexander's drinking problem had made him an unreliable performer.
