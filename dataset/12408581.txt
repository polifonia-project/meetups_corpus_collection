George Michael Biondo (born September 3, 1945 in Brooklyn, New York) was the bass guitarist of the Canadian rock band Steppenwolf, from April 1970 to October 1976. Though born in New York, he has been based in Southern California throughout his ongoing career as a session musician and songwriter.


== Early career ==
Biondo played bass in a Los Angeles area band called Storybook People during which time they released a single on Dunhill Records, which received limited airplay in Los Angeles.  In 1968, Biondo replaced Nick St. Nicholas in another Los Angeles area band called T.I.M.E., when St. Nicholas departed for Steppenwolf.  After T.I.M.E. guitarist Larry Byrom also left to join Steppenwolf, T.I.M.E. briefly attempted to carry on with Biondo as lead singer, but never released any further recordings.


== Steppenwolf ==
In early 1970, Biondo replaced St. Nicholas a second time when he joined Steppenwolf for the recording of Steppenwolf 7, contributing lead vocals on "Fat Jack" and co-lead vocals on "Foggy Mental Breakdown" and the chart-hit, "Who Needs Ya'".  In 1971, the band released their last new album for Dunhill, For Ladies Only for which Biondo wrote "Sparkle Eyes" with John Kay and "In Hopes of a Garden".  He sang lead on the latter, as well as "Jaded Strumpet".  When Steppenwolf went on hiatus in 1972, Biondo became a founding member of the John Kay Band, appearing on both of Kay's solo albums on Dunhill Records.  When Steppenwolf reconvened in the mid-1970s, Biondo was brought back for the album Slow Flux. Then writing "Two for the Love of One" for the Hour of the Wolf album.  Biondo later wrote "Sleep" and co-wrote the instrumental "Lip Service" with Bobby Cochran and Wayne Cook for the Skullduggery album in 1976.  In 1981, Biondo added backing vocals to Wolftracks, the first studio album by John Kay and his new band, now under the moniker John Kay & Steppenwolf.


== After Steppenwolf ==
In 1980, Biondo reunited with Steppenwolf cofounder Jerry Edmonton in a band called Steel Rose. A Steel Rose single penned by Biondo, "Good That You're Gone", was released on Dore Records, and featured Biondo on lead vocals.  When Steel Rose disbanded in 1984, Biondo returned to writing and freelance club and session work.
