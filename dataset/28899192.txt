Darko Lazić (Serbian Cyrillic: Дарко Лазић, born on 13 October 1991) is a Serbian turbo-folk singer. He rose to prominence as the winner of the fourth season of the televised singing contest Zvezde Granda in 2009. His debut album was released the same year under Grand Production.
In October 2018, Lazić had a severe traffic accident, due to driving under influence 100 km per hour and not having his seatbelt on. Although committing several traffic offences, he didn't face any legal consequences. Same year, a video of Lazić consuming cocaine surfaced to the public, which led to him admitting to have had drug addictions.
