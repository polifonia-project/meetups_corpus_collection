Michael Bormann is a German vocalist.  Since the first recording he had made with a band, he has been involved with several groups as their lead vocalist, having accepted contracts to record his vocals on albums rather than being a full-time member of the bands.  However, he was a founding and longtime member of Germany's hard rock band, Jaded Heart.


== Biography ==
Bormann's first step into the music scene was a high school band that he and his brother Dirk formed called High Voltage.  The group changed their name to T.A.X. and then that evolved into Jaded Heart.  His first chance at being with a "made band" was in 1993 when Gaby Hauke (Accept fame) called up Bormann to ask if he was interested in joining Bonfire.  His time with the band was short lived as the band went their separate ways in 1994.  By then, Jaded Heart had released their first album so he was still in the music spotlight.  Worth noting, Bormann and ex-Bonfire mate Angel Schleifer reunited three years later as Charade.
Bormann carried on with Jaded Heart while still maintaining involvement in other projects until 2004.  After the release of the band's seventh album, the group fired him.  He proceeded to continue with his solo career while also being the owner of his own recording studio, RMB Rock-Studios, in Duisburg, Germany.  He was nominated for a few categories for the 50th and 51st Grammy Awards in 2008 and 2009.  Through the years, Bormann has worked with noted musicians such as J.R. Blackmore (son of Ritchie Blackmore of Deep Purple and Rainbow), Jochen 'Zeno' Roth (brother of Uli John Roth of Scorpions fame), Jos Zoomer (from Vandenberg) and Anette Blyckert of Alyson Avenue and Nightwish.
In 2013, after working together in the band The Sygnet (from 1997 to 2000), Bormann joined guitarist Alex Beyrodt and drummer André Hilgers in the band Silent Force replacing previous vocalist D.C. Cooper. The first Silent Force album with Bormann as vocalist is called Rising From Ashes and was released in 2013.
