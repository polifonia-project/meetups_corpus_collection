Since 2010, Akinyele has retired from the rap circuit, and instead opened up the club, V-Live, in 2016 in Miami Beach. Since opening, it has garnered controversy for teetering on being a strip club, which is prohibited in Miami Beach, and for having overly loud music which disturbed the residents living in the area. Due to these and other mounting issues, V-Live was forced to close down in 2019.He is of Nigerian and Panamanian descent.
