Coti was born in Rosario, Santa Fe, though he moved to Concordia, Entre Ríos at the age of three. Upon returning to Rosario, he joined the group Luz Mala, which recorded an album.
In the late 1990s, he penned songs for Andrés Calamaro, Julieta Venegas, Paulina Rubio, Natalia Oreiro, Los Enanitos Verdes, Diego Torres, and Alejandro Lerner. Striking out on his own, he released his first album, Coti, in Spain, getting enough air time from the single Antes que ver el sol to secure him a spot as the opening act for the Spanish stop of Shakira's 2003 tour, Tour of the Mongoose. He was a co-writer of songs in Julieta Venegas's Latin Grammy winning album Sí and Grammy album and Latin Grammy winning Limón y Sal.
