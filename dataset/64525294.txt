Václav Vačkář (born August 12, 1881, Died on February 4th 1954) was a Czech composer and conductor of the late romantic era. He was the father of Dalibor Cyril Vačkář, who was also a notable Czech composer. He is well known for his marches especially for his March “Šohaj” which is well known in his native Czechia. Vačkář is also a very prolific composer with over 300 original pieces of music.
Vačkář received military training in Przemyśl, Poland from 1895-1898 during which he began learning about music through a military program. After his time in Poland Váckář began to play and conduct in various local orchestras including the Czech Philharmonic. In 1952 he wrote the book “Instrumentace Symfonického Orchestru a Hudby Dechové” (Instrumentation for the Symphony Orchestra and Wind Music) with his aforementioned son Dalibor Cyril Vačkář which is still taught in Czech conservatories.


== Influences ==
Vaćkář‘s predecessor Bedřich Smetana innovated the Czech nationalistic style. A style that embodied the desire many Czechs felt to secede from the Austrian Empire and was also adopted by many Czech composers — including Vaćkář. Another significant influence on Vačkář was Antonín Dvořák who was also a champion of Czech nationalism. Dvořak composed a series of Bohemian dances called the “Slavonic Dances” which impart inspired Vačkář to compose his own dances from Bohemia.
