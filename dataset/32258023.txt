Fredric Lieberman (1940 - died May 4, 2013) was an American ethnomusicologist, composer, music professor, and author.  As a faculty member at the University of California at Santa Cruz, he was affiliated with the Music Department (including the undergraduate degree programs, the master's program in ethnomusicology, and the Ph.D. program in cross-cultural musicology). UCSC is where he became known for teaching and studying the Grateful Dead.He was perhaps best known for his role as the key contact between the University of California at Santa Cruz and The Grateful Dead, in finding a home for the band's archives at the university's McHenry Library and for his collaboration with Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart on three of Hart's books: Planet Drum, Drumming at the Edge of Magic, and Spirit Into Sound.  He was a composer of music and published several of his compositions.  He co-authored a biographical study of composer Lou Harrison with Dr. Leta Miller and authored numerous other publications.
Lieberman's early research focused on East Asian musics (especially Chinese music, but his geographic areas of interest included Japan, Korea, Bhutan, Tibet, and South India), then American vernacular music (from Tin Pan Alley to contemporary rock), as well as his work on theories of organology and copyright law (as applied to music and intellectual property). He was an avid collector of traditional musical instruments from around the world.
