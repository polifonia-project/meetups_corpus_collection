Eddie Lund (October 12, 1909 â€“ December 4, 1973) was a pianist and bandleader.
He grew up in Vancouver, Washington, USA, and later moved to Oregon where he worked as a pianist. He later moved to Tahiti in either 1936 or 1938 where he stayed permanently and published and released many records. He was the leader of a popular band, Eddie Lund and His Tahitians which released records on the ABC-Paramount, Decca and Tahiti labels. He picked up the Tahitian language quickly and secured a residence at Quinns night club in Papeete.
Much of Tahiti's music has been written by him. Lund has been referred to as the Irving Berlin of Island music and the father of modern Tahitian folk music. He died in 1973.
