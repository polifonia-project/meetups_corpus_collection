Julma-Henri  (in  English Cruel Henri) is a Finnish rapper based in Helsinki. In addition to his solo act, he was part of rap band Forever from 1998 to 2001 under the name Money. He appeared in collective Julma-Henri & Syrjäytyneet (2007–2010) and from 2010 strongly collaborated as duo Julma-Henri & RPK. With RPK, he launched an official duo rap act known as Eurocrack  (stylized as E U R O C R A C K) in 2012.
Julma-Henri is known for his lurid and gritty sociopolitical lyrics. With names such as Steen1 and Panama Rayo, he became famous for having a remarkably darker, harder and more serious punk influenced lyrical tone compared to other Finnish rappers, who were famous for their relatively light-minded, punchline-centric lyrics. In the early 2000s, his music and public image were widely associated with anarchism and proletarian activism and he made a name for himself by performing in illegal parties, political protests and even riots.


== Career ==
Julma-Henri began his career at Forever, a rap band he formed in Oulu in 1998 under the pseudonym Money. The band released the single "Mobmusic", a demo EP in 2000.

Julma-Henri found recognition with his debut studio album Al-Qaida Finland in 2005 while still residing in Oulu. In many of his releases, he used the name Julma-Henri & Syrjäytyneet (Julma-Henri and the Marginalized). Julma-Henri always appears disguised without revealing much of his face. In 2005 and 2006, he had a joint radio show Bassoradio (a collective project of tens of DJs) with Steen 1 as Julma-Henri & Ystävät (meaning Julma-Henri & Friends) The title was "Free Your Mind" also touring Finland with Asa and Steen 1 and appearing in tracks in releases by them. In 2007, he appeared in a music video with Asa called "240306" (aka "RikRek").

A number of appearances followed in a series of compilations like Asa's Via Karelia, Aisti & Emeto's Exitus in the title track and Leijona's album Vauhtia ja vaarallisia tilanteita. His 2009 release Outo nauha was a split album with Laineen Kasperi. In 2010, he released the album Psykoterapia again crediting Julma-Henri & Syrjäytyneet and dealing, as many of his earlier albums with social exclusion and mental health problems and the dark side of life. The album was released on Mörssi record label and distributed by Playground Music. A single titled "Kipu" (meaning Pain) was released as a single. After Psykoterapia, Julma-Henri & Syrjäytyneet assembly broke in 2010 due to disagreements and Julma-Henri proceeded on collaborations with rapper RPK (of Ceebrolistics fame) with joint Kutsu EP of 6 tracks released in December 2010 credited to Julma-Henri & RPK.
