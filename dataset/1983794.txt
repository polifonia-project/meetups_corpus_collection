== "Number One" ==
In 2001, Playgroup released the single, "Number One", an up-tempo disco dance song. The music video was computer animated and featured a tower PC which was transformed into a humanoid dancing robot during the song. The dancing PC performed various dance moves with disco to breakdance elements in a digital dance arena, complete with lighting effects. Among the moves are some signature ones of famous artists. The list included Michael Jackson's Moon Walk and the glowing tiles under each foot step first seen in his "Billie Jean" video. The rocking version of the Duck Walk popularized by Angus Young of AC/DC was also recreated by the computer-generated dancer. "Number One" peaked at number 66 in the UK Singles Chart.Playgroup also remixed the number 1 single, "Carols", by Ayumi Hamasaki for her remix album, Ayu-mi-x 6: Silver.
