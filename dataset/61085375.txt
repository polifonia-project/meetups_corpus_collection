== Identity speculations ==
Sources have speculated that Peck is a persona of Daniel Pitout, drummer of the Canadian punk band NÃ¼ Sensae, based on the similarity of Peck's tattoos, as well as Peck mentioning that he was in a punk band. Pitout was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and Peck has said he grew up in a well-known part of the Southern Hemisphere. Pitout also starred as a replacement in Peter Pan Goes Wrong in the West End in 2016, which lines up with Peck mentioning he was in a West End play while he lived in London. Peck has not confirmed his identity on the record. Pitout is listed by ASCAP as the songwriter for Peck song "Old River" and other songs that match the titles of the songs released by Peck, such as "Roses Are Falling".


== Personal life ==
Peck is gay. Regarding his reasons for wearing a mask to perform, Peck has stated that "the only reason I don't talk about it in depth is not because I want to dodge any questions, but because I want people to have their own take on it. I don't want to lay it out and pin it down. I just don't think that's important."


== Awards and honors ==
In June 2020, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first LGBTQ Pride parade, Queerty named him among the fifty heroes "leading the nation toward equality, acceptance, and dignity for all people".
