During his childhood, he grew up in Los Angeles with a father who was battling cancer and without a mother as she was in prison for most of the time he was growing up. At the age of 11, he had the dream of becoming a full-time hip hop artist and being part of a hip hop group.By the time Marquez reached his teenage years, he was sent to live with his uncle in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Here, he attended Hopkins High School where he would create the foundations of Doomtree with P.O.S, Paper Tiger, MK Larada and Lazerbeak. When asked on meeting P.O.S on his first day at Hopkins, Marquez stated: "He had a little patch of blue in his hair, and he came up and asked me if I wanted to buy this homemade punk zine he had for $1.”Following high school, he returned to Los Angeles. During this time, he held various odd jobs, including working as a butcher.After four years of living in Los Angeles, Marquez participated in a tour with Doomtree in 2004, being openers for Sage Francis. This eventually lead Marquez into moving back to Minneapolis and officially help create Doomtree as a hip hop collective and label.His first appearance on record was on P.O.S's short lived hip hop group Cenospecies's album Indefinition in 2002. His feature was recorded through the phone while he was still living in Los Angeles.
