William Foster Hayes III (born June 5, 1925) is an American actor and recording artist. His song “The Ballad of Davy Crockett“ hit the top of the Billboard charts in the spring of 1955.
Following a successful career as a musician which began in the late 1940s, he began to focus on dramatic acting parts in the late 1960s, which led him to be cast in a role that gained him additional fame to a younger generation. This new chapter in his career began in 1970 when he originated the character of Doug Williams on NBC's Days of Our Lives, which he continues to play regularly to date on the serial.


== Early life and career ==
Bill was born William Foster Hayes III in Harvey, Illinois on June 5, 1925. He attended Whittier Grade School and Thornton Township High. In March 1943, while a freshman at DePauw University, he enlisted in the Navy Air Corps, and received his welcome letter on his eighteenth birthday ordering him to report for active duty on July 1st. For the next 27 months, he trained to be a fighter pilot. He was two weeks shy of receiving his commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Marine Air Corps, scheduled to fly an F8F off a carrier, when World War II ended. He was awarded the American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal. Given the choice of reenlisting in the Navy or getting out immediately, he opted for civilian life. After five weeks of hitch-hiking around the Mid-West to celebrate with buddies who were also coming home, he returned to complete his Bachelor of Arts requirements at DePauw, getting a degree in June, 1947, majoring in Music and English.Hayes was a singer on the Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca variety show Your Show of Shows in the early 1950s. During the Davy Crockett craze in 1955, three recorded versions of the Ballad of Davy Crockett were in the top 30. Hayes' version was the most popular: It was #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks, sold over two million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. He also starred on Broadway in Rodgers and Hammerstein's Me and Juliet (1953). He had other small hits in the 1950s including "The Berry Tree" and covers of "High Noon" and "Wringle, Wrangle"; the latter was his only other Hot 100 hit, reaching #33 in 1957.On Days of Our Lives, Hayes was introduced as a convict who was also a lounge singer.The character of Doug returned in 1986 and 1987 as well as 1993 and 1996. Most recently, he has been on the show since 1999. His character was killed off in the spring of 2004 by Dr. Marlena Evans. In an elaborate plot hatched by head writer James E. Reilly, Doug turned up alive on a tropical island and went home to his wife.In 2017, World by the Tail, a documentary about Bill Hayes's life, was released and made available for his fans to watch online.On June 27, 2017, while present in the show's audience, Hayes was featured in an impromptu interview on a web special for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon; in his heyday, he had been a guest on the Johnny Carson-hosted version of the show.
