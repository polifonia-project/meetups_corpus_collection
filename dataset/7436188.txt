== Life and career ==


=== Early life ===
Dia Frampton attended Dixie High School in St. George, Utah and Shadow Ridge High School in Las Vegas, Nevada. Dia graduated early by homeschooling her senior year, and at the same time attending public school. Dia then moved to Salt Lake City with her sister to further their music career. She cites Modest Mouse, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Joni Mitchell, The Avett Brothers, Rocky Votolato, Ben Folds, Etta James, Death Cab for Cutie, The Cranberries, and Cursive as influences. During live performances, Frampton plays percussion instruments, such as the cowbell and tambourine, and occasionally a Casio Privia keyboard. She almost always performs without shoes on. She also does not like to eat anything within two hours of performing. Her father is an American of English and Dutch ancestry and her mother is Korean, originally from Seoul.
Frampton often recorded a "song diary," an impromptu recorded song, on her MySpace page. She explained, "It was something very raw, and to be honest, something that I was slightly embarrassed to put up because of the quality but I did anyways, for any of our listeners who would care to hear something not hot off the production belt, but something more organic and 'home made.' It made me feel better to share my feelings with people who could connect, and I think that is what happened with many."


=== 2005–2011: Meg and Dia ===

Along with her sister Meg, Frampton was part of the five-piece alternative rock band Meg & Dia. The band released their debut album "Our Home is Gone" in 2005 (at the time the band was just a two-piece) and later released Something Real under Doghouse Records, which peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. The band found success by promoting their music on MySpace, leading them to become the official MySpace band on the Warped Tour 2006.
Meg & Dia's profile in the rock scene continued to grow, leading to continued appearances at the Warped Tour, touring with bands such as Angels & Airwaves and a record deal with Warner Bros. Records. This deal yielded the pop-rock leaning Here, Here and Here, which charted at No. 103 on the Billboard 200.
In 2010, Warner Bros. dropped the band, reverting the group back to their indie status. Nonetheless, the band released their fourth studio album,  Cocoon, which was received positively by fans and critics, but failed to perform well commercially, leading to Dia's manager, Mike Kaminsky, suggesting she audition for The Voice


=== 2011: The Voice ===
Dia Frampton was a contestant (and eventual runner-up) on the first season of The Voice on NBC, introduced as a children's story author. Frampton stated that she had originally joined the show only with the intention of promoting Cocoon and had not expected that she would make it that far in the competition. She was selected to be on the team of coach Blake Shelton, who stated, "when I heard your voice, I started to smile." Frampton advanced through the show's quarter-finals and semi-finales after renditions of "Heartless" and "Losing My Religion". Notably, the aforementioned singles were the highest charting iTunes digital songs by any contestant on The Voice during its respective voting eligibility period, with "Inventing Shadows" topping the charts at No. 1.
