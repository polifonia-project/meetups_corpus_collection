=== 1985–1995: Early success and initial breakout ===
In 1985, Trevi became a member of a short-lived girl group named Boquitas Pintadas. After the group broke up in 1988, she approached Sergio Andrade for the production of her first solo album, ¿Qué Hago Aquí? (What Am I Doing Here?), which was released in 1989 and scored a number one hit across Latin America, "Dr. Psiquiatra". Trevi was often dubbed as the Madonna of Mexico.In 1991, Trevi released her second album, Tu Ángel de la Guarda (Your Guardian Angel), which is widely regarded as one of her best albums. "Pelo Suelto", the lead single from the album, was a worldwide success, reaching number 1 in several Latin America countries and in Spain. Billboard magazine included Tu Angel de la Guarda in their list of greatest Latin albums of all time. Her third album, Me Siento Tan Sola (I Feel So Lonely), was released in 1992 garnering another hit, "Zapatos Viejos". Trevi starred in the film of the same name in 1993. In 1994, she released two singles, "El Recuento De Los Daños" and "La Papa Sin Catsup", from her fourth studio album Más Turbada Que Nunca (More Turbulent than Ever). Both singles reigned the Billboard Top Latin Albums. In December 1995, Trevi released her final studio album of the decade, and her final album produced by Adrade, Si Me Llevas Contigo (If You Take Me with You). The album produced two moderate hits, "Ella Que Nunca Fue Ella" ("She Who Never Was Herself") and "Si Me Llevas Contigo" ("If You Take Me with You"). On March 13, 1996, Trevi announced that she would retire to care for Andrade during his cancer battle. She offered her last two concerts at the National Auditorium, March 16 and 17.

Following her release, Trevi released her sixth studio album, Como Nace el Universo ("How the Universe was Born"). The album was preceded by the moderate hit "En el Medio de la Tempestad" ("In the Midst of the Storm").
