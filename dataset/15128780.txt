Rendall played lead guitar and sang vocals with Gooding (guitars, vocals) and Pigott (bass guitar, vocals, keyboards). Early practice sessions were held in the front room of a Birchgrove house where Gooding (and later Rendall) lived. They were joined by Julie Anderson (drums) and achieved minor notoriety for their first single "My City of Sydney" (1979), Rendall co-wrote (with Gooding) their second single "Skylab (Son of Telstar)" but he left XL Capris after their next single "World War Three" (October, 1980). Pigott and Gooding created Sweet and Sour (1984) for ABC-TV which followed the first year of a fictional band, The Takeaways, and was based on their experiences with XL Capris.


=== Hoodoo Gurus ===
A chance meeting on New Year's Eve with fellow guitarists Dave Faulkner and Roddy Radalj, led to the formation of the Hoodoo Gurus (with drummer James Baker) in January 1981. Rendall also managed the band whilst they developed the material for their first album Stoneage Romeos. The band supported Gary Glitter on his national tour. Rendall had a  meeting with Joe Strummer at The Sebel Townhouse when The Clash were looking for a Sydney support act. Strummer sat at the pool bar between swims, in his swimming costume and dripping wet. The band dropped the "Le" to become Hoodoo Gurus and later, after Rendall's departure, had a #3 Australian hit with "What's My Scene?" (1987).
