Lent originally joined the duo I Set My Friends on Fire as only a touring drummer assisting Matt Mehana and former member Nabil Moo in 2009. However, the band decided to make him a permanent member soon thereafter. He made his debut with the band on the song "Four Years Foreplay", a compilation with comedy duo Smosh, but his first appearance on a track strictly with the band was a demo version of the group's song "Excite Dyke".
Chris was also touring with The Color of Violence Derek Bloom and Travis Richter side project whenever time permitted. Lent was one of two drummers alongside Daughters drummer Jon Syverson. 
After Nabil Moo left the group, he replaced him as the keyboardist and composer on the group's second album, Astral Rejection. He wrote the script and treatment for the video It Comes Naturally with his brother Nicholas Lent. The video was then directed by Nabil Moo with Nicholas Lent co-directing. This was followed by another successful run on Warped tour '11 and a co-headliner in Europe with A Skylit Drive, after which he left the band.
