Shinji Hosoe (細江 慎治, Hosoe Shinji, born February 28, 1967), also known as MEGATEN and SamplingMasters MEGA, is a Japanese video game composer and musician most famous for scoring Ridge Racer, Street Fighter EX and many Namco arcade games between 1987 and 1996. He also created the in-game music for Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Böse. He was assisted by Yuki Kajiura on the project, though he did not return as a composer for Xenosaga Episode III: Also sprach Zarathustra. He also runs the music production and publishing company SuperSweep, alongside long time collaborator Ayako Saso.
Outside of the video game industry he has a few side projects, most notably Sampling Masters and Oriental Magnetic Yellow (OMY), the latter of which is a parody band of Yellow Magic Orchestra he formed with fellow Namco composers Nobuyoshi Sano, Takayuki Aihara and Hiroto Sasaki.
