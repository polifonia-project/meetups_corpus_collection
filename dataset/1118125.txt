Crawford first performed at club gigs from Cincinnati to Saint-Tropez, but made her name in mid-1970s in New York, where she sang with jazzmen George Benson and Cannonball Adderley.
She signed with Columbia Records and released her first single, "Knock On Wood" / "If You Say the Word" in 1972. Adderley invited her to sing on his album, Big Man: The Legend Of John Henry (1975). During a brief tenure at Columbia Records,  Crawford recorded "Don't Get Caught in Love's Triangle". She is also  one of the vocalists on Fred Wesley & The Horny Horns' A Blow For Me, A Toot To You (1977).In 1978, Crawford sang vocals on "Hoping Love Will Last", the opening song on side two of Please Don't Touch!, which was the second solo album by the former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett.She led R&B veterans the Crusaders on the transatlantic hit "Street Life" (1979).
