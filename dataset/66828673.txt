Little Love is an album that wraps itself around my life for the last 3 years. There is an honesty in the album that I never truly sang or wrote about until this album. Giving myself up in a way that has always terrified me. There were truths I had to confront and lessons that needed to be learnt. I had to own who I was but most importantly own who I wasn't and truthfully, at times that hurt."
