== Career ==


=== 2006-2013: Genki Rockets ===

Yasuda first began modeling in 2006, and appeared in a promotional campaign for Sony's CMOS Sensors. At age 13, Yasuda auditioned to appear in Genki Rockets' music video by dancing to BoA's "Valenti" and singing "Happy Birthday to You." She passed the audition two days later and was not only asked to appear in the music video, but as a singer as well. Yasuda became the image model for Lumi, the band's virtual vocalist, and providing vocals along with Nami Miyahara. The band's first single "Heavenly Star" and its music video were featured in video game Lumines II and No More Heroes. The song was nominated for Best Song by Spike Video Game Awards in 2006 while the band won Best New Artist in Electronic category from iTunes in 2007. As her junior high school didn't allow students to perform, Yasuda kept her work with Genki Rockets a secret and later transferred schools to continue pursuing a singing career.Yasuda acted as Lumi in Child of Eden, where she was resurrected as a persona in the 23rd century. The player is tasked with saving her from a malicious virus. While in Genki Rockets, Yasuda gained no stage experience because all of the band's events use high tech pre-recorded video of her for Live PA, with the notable example of Lumi introducing the former U.S. Vice President Al Gore using Musion Eyeliner in Live Earth concert, Tokyo 2007. Yasuda noted that at first her voice and appearance are heavily processed but later the process effect became weaker and her identity became more clear.


=== 2013-present: Solo career ===
After graduating high school, Yasuda decided to pursue a full-time music career in spite of advice given to her to attend university instead. In 2013, Yasuda changed agencies and debuted as a solo singer under Sony Records with her Japanese name, Rei Yasuda, debuting with "Best of My Love", which served as the ending theme to Space Battleship Yamato 2199. Unlike Genki Rockets, the song's music video was shot on location instead of a green screen. In its music video, the UFO came to the world where the civilization hasn't been developed, which Yasuda found that that contrast is interesting. Kenji Tamai, who Yasuda worked with in Genki Rockets, helped produce and prepare for her solo debut after her high school graduation. In addition to singing, Yasuda also continued modeling, starting the fashion blog Nylonista for Nylon Japan and performing for Nylon's special stage in Girls Award 2013 Autumn/Winter.
