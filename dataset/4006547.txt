== Discography ==
Although Manning has written and recorded many songs, he has released only four of them, on a single EP called All In Your Mind - EP.

Manning also released a 16 song record titled Love Justice, under the band name 'Manning' in early 2015.  The 'Manning' project was never truly promoted but did get a reasonable amount of airplay on indie radio stations.  In 2016, Manning had his release party on an 800-acre historic farm in Franklin, with a follow-up performance at the Nashville venue "The Basement".
