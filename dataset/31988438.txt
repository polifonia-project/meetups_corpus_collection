He has collaborated with James Vincent McMorrow, Dawn Richard, Kilo Kish, Juicy J, Project Pat, Tunji Ige, Lil B, Sam Sparro, Stunnaman, Reggie B & Teki Latex alongside others. He has officially remixed for Jessie Ware,  London Grammar,  Duke Dumont, Childish Gambino, Ellie Goulding, Bipolar Sunshine, Hundred Waters (for Skrillex's OWSLA label) and was selected by ASAP Rocky to open all shows on his 2012 European Tour.

Star Slinger curates an international club night under the name Jet Jam along with visual artists Anze Sekelj & Michaela Selmani. The night's programming puts an emphasis on eclecticism and no emphasis on BPM.  Artists to have played the party include Bondax, Shlohmo & Baths (musician). The JET JAM logo was designed by Michaela Selmani.In November 2012, Jet Jam released its first single in the form of Star Slinger "Ladies In The Back" (Feat. Teki Latex) on 12" vinyl & digital download formats. They have signed many new artists since then and rolled out Toronto-based act Harrison's "Colors" EP in Europe in collaboration with Toronto's Last Gang Records.
