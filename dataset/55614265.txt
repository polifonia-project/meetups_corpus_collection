Boots has said that her nom de plume, Ruby Boots, comes from the idea of being fiery and passionate (Ruby) and from the ideas of a wayfaring troubadour, a musician that travels around a lot, with boots implying moving around (Boots).Boots had vocal nodules, which she worked to remove using non-surgical methods. It required a three-year break from singing, during which time she took classes and ran local open mics.In 2016, Boots relocated to the United States, and now lives in Nashville.
