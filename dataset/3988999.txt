Enrico Pieranunzi (born 5 December 1949) is an Italian jazz pianist. He combines classical technique with jazz.


== Biography ==
The son of Renata Brillantini and Alvaro Pieranunzi, Enrico Pieranunzi was encouraged to study music at a young age. His father was a jazz guitarist. He studied classical music until 1973 when he became a Professor of Music, and remained in the post for two years. In 1975 he left his teaching practice and played in trios and small ensembles. He has recorded over 60 albums and has also been active as a session musician.
Pieranunzi has performed with Frank Rosolino, Sal Nistico, Kenny Clarke, Johnny Griffin, Chet Baker, Joey Baron, Art Farmer, Jim Hall, Marc Johnson, Lee Konitz, Phil Woods, Bill Smith, Charlie Haden, Mads Vinding, Thomas Fonnesbæk, and Billy Higgins. He recorded the first album under his own name in 1975 and has performed with his own group at European and American jazz festivals. He has also composed several film scores.
