Sledge was born on March 28, 1994 where she was raised on the South Side of the Chicago, Illinois. Throughout her childhood, Sledge  moved to a number of locations throughout the city of Chicago.

She explored scatting, poetry writing, and drifted towards singing at the age of 10. Sledge always felt like music was her internal escapism, and by the age of 14, she found interest in becoming a rapper. Sledge has cited rappers J. Cole and Lil Wayne as her biggest musical influences, referring to the former as her favourite rapper of all time.Sledge was putting more time into rapping, she became good friends with fellow Chicago native rapper Sasha Go Hard, and made a guest appearance on Sasha's song, "I Ain't No Hitta" in 2012.
