George Curtis Cameron is an American soul and R&B singer who is currently married to singer Linda Dixon Cameron a.k.a. “Lady L.”.  Perhaps best known as the lead singer of The Spinners on their 1970 hit "It's a Shame" and for his 1975 hit "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday". G.C. is credited with having "six different voices."


== The Spinners ==
After serving in the Vietnam War with the Marines, Cameron joined  Motown act The Spinners as lead singer (though original lead singer Bobby Smith also retained his lead position).  He sang both lead parts on their first big hit, 1970's "It's a Shame", co-written and produced by Stevie Wonder.  However, when The Spinners left Motown the following year, Cameron remained with Motown as a solo artist.Cameron rejoined The Spinners in 2000, after then-current frontman John Edwards suffered a stroke. He remained with The Spinners well into the early 2000s, during which time he appeared with them on a PBS music special, singing his 1970 hit "It's A Shame", before leaving again to join The Temptations in 2003.


== Solo artist ==
Releasing several solo singles in the early 1970s, he became known for his ability to sound like other artists, such as Smokey Robinson on his song "(Don't Wanna) Play Pajama Games", Curtis Mayfield on "No Matter Where" and The Isley Brothers on his duet with Willie Hutch "Come Get This Thang". Although Cameron was not a major-seller for the label, he did have a hit with "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday", the theme song of the 1975 film Cooley High, which was later covered by Boyz II Men. 
Cameron left Motown after the 1970s, and toured as an independent artist. He recorded a critically acclaimed album for Malaco Records in 1983 and his career was revived in 1989 by recordings for British record companies Ardent (owned at the time by Paul Mooney) and Motorcity (owned by Ian Levine). He also recorded another solo album titled Shadows. Shadows was co-produced by Ben Obi of Savannah Street Music.
