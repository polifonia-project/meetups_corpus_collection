== Biography ==
D'Amato grew up in Blairstown, New Jersey, and attended college at Princeton University, where he recorded his first album 'Down Wires' in a dormitory during his senior year. He released the record independently in 2010, catching the attention of NPR, which called his song "My Father's Son" a "modern folk gem," and the World Cafe, which featured him in their emerging artist series "Next."
D'Amato followed it up with another home recording, 'Paper Back Bones,' which made BBC Scotland's Best Americana Albums of 2012, and was described by host Ricky Ross as "one of [our] favourites of all time."In 2014, D'Amato released his New West Records debut, 'The Shipwreck From The Shore,' which was inspired in part by his time studying with the Pulitzer Prize-winning Irish poet Paul Muldoon and earned widespread critical acclaim, with NPR noting that "he writes in the tradition of Bruce Springsteen or Josh Ritter" and USA Today saying it "strikes every right note." The album was recorded with producer Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter, Langhorne Slim) at The Great North Sound Society in Maine with members of Bon Iver and Megafaun. Songs from the record collectively cracked more than three million plays on Spotify and turned up on the ABC series Nashville, while the album earned additional praise everywhere from the New York Times and WSJ to NY Mag and Billboard.D'Amato returned in 2016 with 'Cold Snap,' recorded in Omaha, NE, with producer Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes, First Aid Kit) and featuring performances by Conor Oberst and members of Bright Eyes, The Faint, and Cursive. RollingStone.com named him an "Artist You Need To Know", and D'Amato made his national TV debut on CBS This Morning.
