== Early life ==
Howard-Darling was born (August 9, 1949) in Stockton, California and raised in Folsom, California, a suburb of Sacramento, California to parents Elmo Robert Berry and Angeles Calamaya. Darling is a 6th generation Californian.
She began performing professionally at fourteen years old with the band, The Kee-Notes, and became a member of the Sacramento Musician's Union in 1964.  In 1965 the band recorded three songs for Esar Records, making Darling one of the first female rock drummers to record rock music.  She credits her younger and older brothers as her greatest early influences, as they were both musicians, and there was a drum kit in their living room where she could practice.  In 1966, she joined the all-female Sacramento band The Svelts, which would later evolve into Fanny, becoming the first all-woman band to be signed to a major record label to record a full album.
In 1967, Howard-Darling married Mike Brandt. She gave birth to her daughter Brandi Brandt in 1968.


== Career ==


=== Fanny ===
Howard-Darling  joined former band members in Los Angeles in 1970, forming a short-lived lineup of the all-female band Fanny as the lead singer.  A decision was made to change the number of band members from five members to four creating more of a Fab Four image.  She left the band and pursued other musical ventures.
Howard-Darling rejoined Fanny in 1974, recording Rock and Roll Survivors released on Casablanca Records.  The first single, "I've Had It" reached #79 on the Billboard Hot 100. Their second single, Butter Boy, spent 11 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #29 on April 5, 1975.  Fanny was the first all-woman rock band to release an album on a major label. After a U.S. tour promoting the album, Darling (Brie Howard) left the band.
David Bowie said of Fanny in 1999 to Rolling Stone:
They were one of the finest ... rock bands of their time. They were extraordinary: They wrote everything ... they were just colossal and wonderful, and nobody's ever mentioned them. They're as important as anybody else who's ever been, ever; it just wasn't their time.
In 2018, original band members Jean Millington (bass), June Millington (lead guitar), and Howard-Darling reunited as Fanny Walked the Earth, releasing an eponymous album, their first recording together in more than 40 years. It features several female musicians who have credited Fanny with helping open the door for them decades ago, among them the Runaways’ Cherie Currie, the Go-Go's Kathy Valentine, the Bangles’ Susanna Hoffs, Vicki and Debbi Peterson, veteran rock singer and musician Genya Ravan and former Fanny member Patti Quatro, the sister of Suzi Quatro.
