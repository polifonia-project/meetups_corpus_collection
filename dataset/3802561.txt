He then joined forces with Robert Cray and sang and played harmonica in The Robert Cray Band for six years, including singing on Cray's debut album, released in 1980.  Salgado and Cray parted ways in 1982.  Salgado went on to front Roomful of Blues, singing and touring with them from 1984 through 1986.  Returning to Oregon, he formed Curtis Salgado & The Stilettos in 1991 on the JRS label.  The band opened for The Steve Miller Band during the summer of 1992.

He signed with Shanachie Records in 1999 and released four albums on that label, before signing with Chicago's Alligator Records in 2012.Salgado was the inspiration behind John Belushi's creation of the Blues Brothers characters in the late 1970s.
