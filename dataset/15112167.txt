Jude (born Michael Jude Christodal, October 16, 1969, Boston, Massachusetts) is an American singer and songwriter.


== History ==
Jude's debut album, 430 N. Harper Ave, was released independently by the Fish of Death label in 1997. Maverick signed Jude and released his second album, No One Is Really Beautiful  which contained several re-recordings of some of the debut album's tracks. Two tracks from No One Is Really Beautiful charted: "I'm Sorry Now" (#33 Billboard Adult Top 40 Chart) and "Rick James" (#29 Billboard Adult Top 40 Chart, #28 Billboard Modern Rock Chart).
The song "I Know" was featured on the multi-platinum City of Angels soundtrack. The song "I Do" from No One Is Really Beautiful was used in several television shows. During this time, Jude also toured with Alanis Morissette, Ben Folds Five, The Cranberries, Dido, Tori Amos, Better Than Ezra, Train, and Chris Isaak.
His follow-up album, King of Yesterday was released on September 11, 2001. The album featured a cover of Bread's "Everything I Own". Jude soon parted ways with Maverick and produced his subsequent albums independently (Sarah in 2004 and Redemption in 2006).
Currently, Jude is signed with Naive records in Paris, France. Naive released Redemption in Europe in September 2006, and released the single "Save Me" via iTunes in October. The whole album was released in the US in November 2006.
In 2006, Jude, Chris Seefried, Jeff Russo and Dave Gibbs formed the band Low Stars. They released an eponymous CD through the Starbucks Hear music label in 2007. The song "Calling All Friends", which appears on the album and was penned by Jude, is the theme for the ABC drama What About Brian. In August 2007, Jude left the Low Stars.
Jude is currently based in Los Angeles, writing songs for film and television. In 2015, he launched a PledgeMusic campaign to record the EP Me and My Monster, which was released in 2016.
