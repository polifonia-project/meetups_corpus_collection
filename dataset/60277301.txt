Fanciulli began his career in music at Plastic Surgery Records, Maidstone where he worked for two years in the early 2000s. Inspired by Laurent Garnier he began to DJ, handing out demo tapes to local promoters in Maidstone. Among them was Sergio (Serge) Bienati, promoter of well-known local event brand ClubClass. Nic slipped him several anonymous tapes, after receiving the third tape Serge went on a manhunt, eventually tracking Nic down and giving him his break. Serge gave Nic a residency in the main room at ClubClass at a club called Atomics when he was 19 and signed him to the Club Class booking agency in 2003.
In 1998 Fanciulli set up his own label, Portent Records, putting out his first release ‘Dockside’ (with Matt Blewett) in 2000. Releases include the Mojolators ‘Drifting’ (featuring Camilla) which was played by Pete Tong on Radio 1 for 14 consecutive weeks, eventually being licensed to Multiply Records, a sub-label of Telstar/BMG.
