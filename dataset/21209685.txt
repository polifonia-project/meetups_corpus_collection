Paul Danblon (25 July 1931 – 8 February 2018) was a Belgian composer, opera director and administrator, and journalist. He was one of the pioneers of scientific journalism on RTBF (Radio télévision belge de la communauté française).  In 1954, after graduating in chemistry from the Université Libre de Bruxelles, Danblon joined the RTBF current events programme, Carnets de l'Actualité. He went on to specialize in producing and presenting popular science programmes such as La Bouteille à encre, Connaître, and Le point de la médecine. He is the author of two books in the area:

150 ans de sciences (1830–1980)  (Paul Legrain, Brussels, 1980)
