== Career ==


=== Music ===
From the early 1980s to the late 1990s, Jones performed with the post-punk band Fifth Column, playing drums, guitar and background vocals, and was one of the co-founders of the group. The band's first album, To Sir With Hate was released in 1985. In 2002, Fifth Column's last release, Imbecile, appeared on the Kill Rock Stars compilation album Fields and Streams.


=== Artwork and publications ===
G. B. Jones initially received recognition for her drawings, which were published in the queer punk fanzine J.D.s, founded by Jones and co-published with Bruce LaBruce.According to Dodie Bellamy, G. B. Jones "co-opts the male-on-male objectifying gaze of gay erotica and converts it to a female-on-female gaze" and her Tom Girls series of drawings (based on the work of Tom of Finland) are "unapologetic, thrillingly anti-assimilationist."


== Exhibition history ==
Jones' first gallery was Feature Inc. in New York, curated by Hudson, who was the first art dealer to showcase her Tom Girls series of drawings from 1991 to 1999. Exhibitions of her work have been held at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, Mercer Union, Paul Petro Contemporary Art in Toronto, La Centrale in Montreal, and other galleries.
