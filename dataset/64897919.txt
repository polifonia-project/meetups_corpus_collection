Maria Rita Brondi (5 July 1889 – 1 July 1941) was an Italian guitarist, lutenist, singer, composer, and music historian.


== Early life ==
Maria Rita Brondi was born in Rimini. She studied guitar with Luigi Mozzani, and with Francisco Tárrega; she studied voice with Paolo Tosti in England. Tárrega dedicated a solo guitar composition to Brondi.


== Career ==
Brondi toured in Europe as a guitarist and singer, known for singing Italian regional folk songs. She was also a composer of guitar works. She wrote a book on the history of the guitar, titled Il liuto e la chitarra (1926), which was published in several editions through the twentieth century. She was mentioned as a peer of Italian musicians Elisabetta Oddone (1878-1972) and Geni Sadero (also known as Eugenia Scarpa, 1886-1961), though both of them outlived her. Julian Bream mentioned her as making early lute recordings, in company with Suzanne Bloch and Diana Poulton.


== Personal life ==
Brondi died at age 51 in Rome, in 1941. Her compositions are still played and recorded, for example on a collection titled Guitar Music by Women Composers (2009), by Dutch guitarist Annette Kruisbrink.
