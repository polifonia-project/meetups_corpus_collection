Mark Whitecage (June 4, 1937 â€“ March 7, 2021) was an American jazz reedist.


== Career ==
Whitecage played in his father's family ensemble as early as age six. In the 1980s, he played with Gunter Hampel's Galaxy Dream Band, Jeanne Lee, and Saheb Sarbib. After touring solo in Europe in 1986, he put together two bands as a leader, Liquid Time and the Glass House Ensemble. In the 1990s, his first release with Liquid Time was chosen by Cadence Magazine as one of the year's best albums. He worked in the Improvisers Collective from 1994, and began releasing albums on CIMP in 1996. Late in the 1990s he worked with Anthony Braxton, including in performances of Braxton's opera, Trillium R. He also played with William Parker, Perry Robinson, Joe Fonda, Dominic Duval, Joe McPhee, Steve Swell, Richie "Shakin'" Nagan and Sikiru Adepoju.
He was married to clarinetist Rozanne Levine; they performed together with Perry Robinson in a trio called Crystal Clarinets.
