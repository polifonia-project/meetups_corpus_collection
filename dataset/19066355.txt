== Biography ==
Josh Logan was born in Cartersville, Kentucky. As a teenager, he was taught guitar chords by his cousin. For twelve years, Logan worked at an auto salvage yard, performing nightly at local bars. Logan's musical inspirations were George Jones, Merle Haggard, and Mel Street, to whom he has been compared in vocal styling.Eventually, Logan was signed to Curb Records, releasing his debut single "I Made You a Woman for Somebody Else", which was withdrawn when Conway Twitty recorded it. By 1988, Logan had released his first album Somebody Paints the Wall. This album produced three chart singles, the highest-charting being "Every Time I Get to Dreamin'", which spent nine weeks on the Billboard Hot Country Singles (now Hot Country Songs) charts and peaked at No. 58. Both it and its follow-up, "Somebody Paints the Wall", reached Top 40 on the Cash Box country charts as well. The latter song was also a Top 10 for Tracy Lawrence in 1992.
The album's success led to tours with Garth Brooks and Earl Thomas Conley. The third and final single, "I Was Born with a Broken Heart", was co-written by Aaron Tippin, whose own version was later released as a single from his 1992 album Read Between the Lines. David Ball also recorded the song on his 1989 self-titled debut, although this album was not released until 1994. Logan left Curb in the early 1990s, then he released an album called Something Strange in Europe in 1995. This album produced multiple singles on the European country singles charts, including two top-20 hits.Logan was honored in 2002 with a display at the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame in Renfro Valley, Kentucky. One year later, he released his third album, Cartersville, Kentucky Country Boy, followed by I Am What I Am in 2009.
