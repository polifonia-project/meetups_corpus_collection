He retired in order to focus on his family.In 2020, Kinkade decided to return to creating music with his own band, The Monarch. On his social media, he stated- “I felt as if I was just wasting my life by not making music. I’m older now, I have a child, a career. Everything is essentially great to the eye but I’ve sincerely missed doing what I do best- playing music. By resurrecting my own personal project that I started 20 years ago, I’m finally making it happen on my own terms and under my own rules. My back is fixed and I’m playing better than I ever have. Here we come.”
The Monarch independently released (digitally through Bloodblast Distribution) debut album “All The World’s Pain” in February of 2021.
