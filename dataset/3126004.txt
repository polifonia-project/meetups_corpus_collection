"Dave Bainbridge is a genius of immeasurable proportions….working with artists as varied as Buddy Guy, Jack Bruce and IONA. If you are unfamiliar with him it's time to make amends. Trust me."
Nick Beggs (Kajagoogoo / Steve Wilson / Steve Hackett etc., etc.)"I've been listening to 'Celestial Fire' and I love it!  Wow… That's some amazing stuff man! Really one of the best albums I've heard in a while."
Neal Morse (Spock's Beard / Transatlantic / Flying Colors)“Dave is both a solo artist and a major driving force behind the band Iona. His fluid, emotional guitar playing, epic keyboard work and expansive compositions combine into one of this generation’s most powerful and original musical voices.” 
John Kellogg (producer for Britney Spears, Chicago, Foreigner, Black Crows, Deep Purple, ELP)“Bainbridge's guitar playing is superb; his electric solos conjure Eric Johnson and Allan Holdsworth, while his acoustic technique dazzles, thanks to a remarkable dexterity and the use of unusual tunings.…”

Chris  MacIntosh 88.1fm WCWP New York“Soaring guitar passages, stunning keyboard work, and inspirational waves of orchestral prog.” Bert Saraco
