== Influence ==
Crystal Kay is considered a pioneer for interracial acts in Japan. She debuted in 1999 when R&B began to take off in Japan thanks to local acts MISIA, Double and Hikaru Utada. Her success paved the way for the mainstream success of many mixed-race artists in the mid-2000s (decade) such as Thelma Aoyama and African-American/Japanese enka singer Jero.


== Personal life ==
In 2009, Crystal Kay said, "There is still some racial thing going on, [but] people are getting used to it. You can see a lot more mixed people on TV, and even (among) models in magazines." At a summer festival that year, the half-Japanese half-Papua New Guinean singer Emi Maria left Crystal Kay a demo and a note saying, "You're my idol, I'm sad I couldn't meet you in person." Nevertheless, Crystal Kay has said, "I consider myself a Japanese artist because I was born and raised here, but nationality-wise I look, and am, foreign."Crystal Kay holds American citizenship.
