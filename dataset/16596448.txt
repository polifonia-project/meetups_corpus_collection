==== The Secret Life of Cows ====

This is a cohesive body of work. Glen with his surrealist attitude is really having fun with us.” The exhibition receive front-page feature coverage in the arts and entertainment section of the July 7, 2007 Los Angeles Times.

Michael Ochs, music archivist, curator, and author states: “Glen Wexler doesn’t just create rock and roll album covers, he is rock and roll – in the best sense of the term. His album covers rock in their lyrical depiction and expansion of musical moments. He captures the essence of the artist and then wails with his own solo, creating a new entity that actually stands on its own.”
