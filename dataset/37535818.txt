Rob Waring (born December 3, 1956 in Yonkers, New York) is an American-Norwegian Contemporary music composer and performer (drums and vibraphone), commonly associated with symphony orchestras and jazz ensembles.


== Career ==
Waring studied with Roland Kohloff, who had just become timpanist of the New York Philharmonic, while still in high school. Then he continued studies on percussion at the Juilliard School with Saul Goodman and Elden "Buster" Bailey (1974–79), and earned his Bachelor and Master of Music Degrees. During that period, he also took elective courses in composition with Stanley Wolfe, and studied jazz vibraphone in 1975 with Dave Samuels. He started a career as a freelance musician in New York, and worked in symphony orchestras, jazz groups, ensembles for new music, and an experimental ensemble for homemade instruments.
In 1981, Waring moved to Oslo and since then has participated on numerous recordings and established the Rob Waring Trio with Frank Jakobsen and Carl Morten Iversen (1987–).  He teaches at Norges Musikkhøgskole, and has played in bands like Søyr and contributed on releases by Erik Wøllo (1983), Espen Rud (1984), Torgrim Sollid (1983), Rune Klakegg, Tone Hulbækmo (1986), Arve Moen Bergset (1987), Kjell Samkopf (1987), Morten Halle (1988), Lasse Thoresen (1994), Peter Opsvik (1999), Lars Klevstrand (2000), Torbjørn Sunde oktett (2001), Elin Rosseland (2004), SKRUK (2004), and on the Jon Larsen records Strange News From Mars (2007) and The Jimmy Carl Black Story (2008).
