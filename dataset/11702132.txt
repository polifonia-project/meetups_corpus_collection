Andrew Maynard Parker (born 21 March 1952 in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, England) is a British rock drummer best known as the founding member and drummer of the hard rock/heavy metal band, UFO.
Parker began drumming when he was only 7 years old.  Ten years later, he started his first rock band with high school friends Phil Mogg and Pete Way called UFO. He joined the group at the age of 16 in 1969. While he joined the band, he recruited guitarist Mick Bolton. Later as the group was gaining momentum, Parker and Mogg started having "run-ins" with Bolton and fired him shortly after. Parker, Mogg, and Way then needed a guitarist and recruited German future virtuoso Michael Schenker.
Parker has been in UFO from 1969 to the present. Parker had medical problems between late 2005 and early 2007, and his spot in UFO was briefly filled by Jason Bonham, until Parker's medical issues were taken care of.He lives, together with his wife, in Granbury, Texas.
