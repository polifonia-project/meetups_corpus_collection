== Early life ==
Timotheus "Timo" Romme was born on 23 March 1987 in Amsterdam, Netherlands, where he spent his childhood. He started learning mixing for fun after a friend sold him some turntables, and by the age of 18 he was deejaying. Romme studied to be a fashion designer at The Hague in the Netherlands. In 2015, he explained that "after a few years [at university], I noticed I liked music more than fashion. I don't really follow the trends." MOTi started producing music in 2005, stating "the guys at the record store told me I couldn’t cut breaks out of records, so I decided to make my own music." He started his music career performing Dutch house with his cousin as a duo called Groovenatics.

It was an important project to show my technical skills and, of course, a big audience got to see my name next to his.”MOTi remixed "Hello (MOTi Remix)" by the Stafford Brothers in 2013, which stayed at No. 1 on Beatport’s Hip Hop chart for around two months.

He added his sick breakdown to it, and we finished the track together." October 2014 saw the release of "Virus (How About Now)" through Spinnin, which reached #1 on the Beatport 100.

=== 2018–present: Zero Cool records ===
In November 2018, MOTi founded his own independent record label: Zero Cool. He wanted to create a more inclusive label, where popularity didn't come in the way of music:
"At some point it felt like I wasn’t producing the records I wanted to produce, but instead what the A&Rs wanted me to create. I think everyone has a moment in their career where you just want to create whatever you feel like creating, and for me this was it. On my label Zero Cool it doesn’t matter what the new trend or hype is, how big your Instagram or Spotify profile is… if it’s good, I’ll release it. That’s why it’s called Zero Cool, it’s for everyone!"One year after its creation, Zero Cool reached a 100 million streams on Spotify.[1]


== Musical style ==
Incorporating diverse genres such as electro house, progressive house, hip hop, and others, MOTi has cited artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Alter Ego and Derrick May as musical inspirations. About his musical intent, he stated in 2016 that "for the club tracks I just want people to have a good time and party to the music. For the slower tracks or less clubby tracks I hope people get carried away by it when they play it at home."
