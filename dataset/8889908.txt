His statements about his sexuality include this response to a tip Berlin interviewer:

tip: Do you have a personal theory why so many countertenors are gay?
Philippe Jaroussky: I am. But that doesn’t mean that all, or even the majority of countertenors are. I only realized one thing: on stage, love scenes with a woman are a lot easier to do when your stage partner knows you’re gay. The only challenge is not getting a laughing fit. Otherwise it’s pure fun.
