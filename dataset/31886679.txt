Following Luke Friend's appearance on 2013's X Factor and subsequent top 40 hit, Future Music threatened to sue Friend for alleged breach of contract. Future Music argued that "the winner must give TeenStar, run by Future Music, first refusal on management services within 18 months of winning", in addition to "appearances and promotion for an 18 month period from the end of the competition for a minimum of 5 times." Luke Friend's management company, Crown Management, have stated that "Our client was saddened to have received this claim from Future Music with whom he worked amicably for some time, including during his time in X-Factor. The claim has absolutely no basis in fact and will be robustly defended. We have every expectation that our client will be vindicated in due course."
