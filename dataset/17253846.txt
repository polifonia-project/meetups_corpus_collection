== Life and career ==
Crutchfield was born in 1957 in Raleigh, North Carolina and spent most of his childhood in Newport News, Virginia, where he attended Hilton Elementary School and Warwick High School. As a youngster Crutchfield studied piano under Cary McMurran. In 1975, while still in high school, he signed on with the fledgling Virginia Opera, which had been organized the previous year in Norfolk. He graduated from Northwestern University with a B.A. in political science. His father, a Presbyterian minister, the Rev. Dr. Robert S. Crutchfield of Newport News, Va., is also a professional operatic tenor.A specialist in the bel canto repertoire, he prepared the first performing edition of Donizetti's Élisabeth ou la fille de l'exilé and conducted its world premiere at the Caramoor Festival on July 17, 2003. Crutchfield conducted Rossini's Ciro in Babilonia at the 2012 Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, marking the first collaboration between his Bel Canto at Caramoor program and the Rossini Opera Festival. He returned to the Rossini Opera Festival in 2014 to conduct Aureliano in Palmira in the world premiere of the critical edition of the score which he edited for Casa Ricordi.  His performances and the subsequent recording of this work garnered the 2015 prize for best rediscovered work at the International Opera Awards.  In the summer of 2016, he conducted Aureliano in Palmira in its North American premiere for the Bel Canto at Caramoor International Music Festival.In 2014, Crutchfield was named a fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. In addition to his scholarly work on vocal style, Crutchfield was the youngest music critic in the history of The New York Times, where he was a regular contributor from 1983 to 1989. He has also authored numerous reviews and articles for Opera News, including his Crutchfield at large series.Since 2017 Crutchfield's activity has centered on Teatro Nuovo, where he has sought revival of period performing style in Italian opera in a way the Wall Street Journal described as "transformative". In 2019 the company presented Rossini's La gazza ladra and Stabat Mater, Bellini's La straniera, and Donizetti's Symphony in E Minor, with Crutchfield's reconstruction of the unfinished final movement. In March 2020, Opera Lafayette commissioned and performed his reconstruction, from Beethoven's sketches, of the original 1805 version of Florestan's aria in "Fidelio, lost when the opera was shortened in 1806.
