Clark was born and raised in Buffalo, New York. Self-taught, Clark stood out in the Buffalo music scene and was often compared to the next Ani DiFranco.

In 2007, Clark went back into the studio with Kirkpatrick to create her album Apples & Oranges. Without the help of a record label, she worked full-time to fund the album. The album was released November 20 and many of the songs off the album where featured on television including MTV and CBS. The album features guest vocals from: Tom Higgenson, Tim Pagnotta and Aaron Marsh. During the summer Clark appeared as a guest VJ for MTV on its Portland, Oregon segment of The Big Ten. Aside from constant touring, Clark also sang back up vocals with Copeland at their Henry Fonda Theater Rentals support show.
In 2008, Clark's songs "Say What You Want", "Closer", "Empty Bottles" were played on MTV's hit series "The Hills" and "Matter of Time" was played on ABC's hit TV show Make It Or Break It. She sang on Jack's Mannequin's album "The Glass Passenger" on the tracks "Crashin'" and "Spinning". All of her hard work helped her land on the 'Top 10' list for 944 Magazine 'Who's Who in Orange County'. Clarks music is played in Victoria's Secret, DKNY, Forever 21, Calvin Klein, Sephora, BCBG, Nordstrom stores among hotels, movie theaters and restaurants.  In September, Clark signed a record deal with Jeff Ayeroff to Shangri-La Music (The Pretenders, Monsters of Folk, Band of Skulls, The Duke Spirit).  She worked closely with A&R David Field (Björk, Radiohead, Band of Skulls) and recorded her album Connect the Dots with producer Matt Appleton (Panic! at the Disco, The Veronica's, The Used, Foxy Shazam) in Venice Beach, CA. Clark got released from Shangrila. Her song "Touch & Go" was selected for the Canadian National Sprint Bell Palm Pre Commercial. Other songs off the album have received placement including her song "All Time Low" on CW's One Tree Hill.
In March 2010, Clark signed a deal with Vanguard Records her album "Connect the Dots" was released on August 10, 2010.  She released three music videos to support her LP release. Her music video "Touch & Go", directed by 8112 Studios, was premiered exclusively through Absolute Punk ". Her music video for "Hold On", directed by Jay Torres (known for his work on  Aerosmith, Madonna music videos) was released exclusively in September on Teen Vogue and the non-profit To Write Love On Her Arms. Clark shot her music video "Not Enough" in Santa Ana, California directed by Steve Gunzman. In July 2010, Clark opened for the rock band America in front of 15,000 people at Artpark, Western New York's premiere destination for music. Clark landed the iTunes "Single of the Week" for her song "White Lies" getting 420,000 downloads landing her a spot at no. 7 ahead of Lady Gaga for top record sales in a day. This help Clark garnish airplay on Top 40 stations around the world helping her to make the September 2010 Billboard Heat Seekers Chart.In 2011, her album "Connect the Dots" landed at no. 70 on Amazon "Best Albums of 2011" Clark was also nominated for five Orange County Music Awards (Best Pop, Best Live Acoustic Performer, Best Video, Best Song "Touch & Go" and Best Record). Winning 'Best Pop Artist'.  Clark went LA Ink to get her 'Connect the Dots' artwork tattooed by Dan Smith to document her musical journey. Her song "I Do" was used in the Season Finale of Keeping Up with the Kardashians when Kris Humphries proposed to Kim Kardashian.
On November 22, Clark independently released 'Patterns' on her label One Small Instrument Records. Buffalo News reviewed it as having "Dreamy pop with folk roots.  Clark is the genuine article, a deeply talented songwriter and record maker with a gorgeous voice. 'Patterns' is beautifully produced, and is crammed full of deft, subtle harmonic and sonic touches. Smart, sexy, and sometimes, simply sublime." ITunes reviewed it as "overflowing with all kinds of charm. The opener, "Lose My Mind," sets the tone with a perfect blend of indie and pop, as retro-sounding synthesizers work their way around percolating beats while Clark's cooing vocals melt over a catchy chorus. The following "Days into Nights" is less busy; it gives Clark plenty of room to stretch her vocal range, especially in the wide-open refrain where her notes soar outward. Old-school drum and bass textures pepper the comforting "Sign," where her breathy inflections wash over the listener. The innovatively arranged "Decimals and Music Notes" moves with unpredictable changes that rub against the grain of her smooth and simple vocal style. It's refreshing to hear a songstress confidently come into her own style, most noticeably in "Breathe," where the sole accompaniment of an acoustic guitar really lets you home in on her lovely voice.".In 2012, Clark took home the 'Best Singer-Songwriter Award' for Artists in Music held in Los Angeles at the Key Club. Artists in Music Awards – All indie music. In July, she opened for Eddie Money at the Molson Lockport Canal Series in Lockport, NY and August for Roger Hodgson of Supertramp at Artpark.
