Donata started as student lecturer and broadcaster at Radio Zagreb and continued as Music Editor of Stereorama programme on Radio Belgrade. In 1965 she was invited to start the Radio Beograd Third Programme (music section) as its first musicologist, and in 1983 its first stereo weekend Music Programme Stereorama, which was closed down in November 2015, while celebrating the 50th anniversary of its III Programme.
