== Music career ==
Thor started the concept Thor in 1973. He combined strength feats, props, costumes and showmanship with music: his feats included bending solid steel bars in his teeth and having solid concrete blocks smashed off his chest with a sledgehammer. Jon Thor created the "THOR T in Shield Logo" in 1973 which would become the copyright and trademark for the band. Thor toured Canada and the US throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In 1976, Thor performed on American national television with his appearance on The Merv Griffin Show.
Shortly after, Jon recorded the album Keep the Dogs Away in 1976–77 through his own company God Of Thunder Productions. The album was licensed to RCA and released in early 1978.  Jon appeared on the cover artwork as "Thor The Rock Warrior", holding back four dobermans. In February 1984 Thor performed at the Marquee in London, England, to great reaction from the audience which included Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin. The review in Kerrang magazine proclaimed "He Came, He Thor, He Conquered". The reception of that show launched Thor's career to a new level. He then licensed recordings to Albion Records. Albion released songs such as "Thunder On the Tundra" and "Let the Blood Run Red" which went to number one on the UK Rock Chart. Thor toured throughout the UK performing at such concerts as the Great Yarmouth Festival and released albums such as Only the Strong (1986) and Recruits - Wild in the Streets (1986).

== Other ventures ==
A native of Vancouver, Jon Thor, an avid historian and sports enthusiast, resurrected the Vancouver Millionaires hockey team, Vancouver's only Stanley Cup champions who won the cup in 1915. He actively pursued a retail and internet merchandising program incorporating his trademarks of the Vancouver Millionaires name and 'V' logo which he owned since 1977. He created a marketing concept using concerts, music and sporting events which made the Vancouver Millionaires synonymous with his Thor image. After years of historical study and promotion, Thor turned ownership of the Vancouver Millionaires, their website and the 'Victory V' logo over to the Vancouver Canucks and the NHL.
He is also the founder of VM Sports, a line of authentic Vancouver Millionaires apparel such as reproductions of the team's jerseys. Thor's Millionaires memorabilia commemorates the city's historic 1915 Stanley Cup-winning team. Several different Thor Rock God comic books were produced in the 1980s, most drawn by future Rock 'N' Roll Comics illustrator Ken Landgraf.
