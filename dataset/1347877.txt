Andy LaRocque (born Anders Allhage, 29 November 1962) is a Swedish guitarist, songwriter, and producer, best known as a member of the heavy metal band King Diamond since 1985.


== Biography ==
LaRocque started in the Swedish hard rock band Swedish Beauty, which later changed its name to Swedish Erotica. He also played on the Death album Individual Thought Patterns and the IllWill album Evilution, along with former members of Mercyful Fate. He can be heard on other albums as well, such as Falconer's Chapters from a Vale Forlorn, where he performed lead guitars on the song "Busted to the Floor".LaRocque contributed a guitar solo to the track "Cold" on the album Slaughter of the Soul by Swedish melodic death metal group At the Gates. Producer Fredrik Nordström was responsible for the idea, and telephoned LaRocque. At the Gates' guitarist Anders Björler gave LaRocque an audio cassette recording of the song. The tape played at the wrong speed at LaRocque's house, so LaRocque had to transcribe the recording. Two days after receiving the cassette, LaRocque laid down a guitar solo for the song within half an hour. Björler described the solo as "great" and in a November 2007 interview admitted he still couldn't play the solo "properly".LaRocque opened a studio called the "Los Angered Recordings" in Angered, Sweden in 1995, where he produced and recorded albums for many bands. In 2007, he moved the studio to Varberg and renamed it "Sonic Train Studios" where he continues to record and produce for various rock and heavy metal bands.He is known for his signature playing style which incorporates neoclassical elements, using exotic scales such as harmonic minor, phrygian dominant, and diminished minor. His extended theory knowledge enables him to mix these scales with others such as the blues scale and melodic minor. He has a distinct guitar tone for his solos, and often incorporates layers of harmonies over his runs and phrasing. He frequently uses a mixture of classically-flavored arpeggio sequences and alternate picked runs mixed with melodic lines to create his signature style.LaRocque was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2007. He is regularly listed as among the best or most underrated guitarists in heavy metal. He cites Michael Schenker and Randy Rhoads as major influences. He also likes Steve Vai and Tony Iommi, and was impressed by the friendliness of Chuck Schuldiner when he recorded Individual Thought Patterns with him.
