Hamilton began his film career in 1958, and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television, he is perhaps most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual sun tan. Bo Derek wrote in her autobiography that "there was an ongoing contest between John [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner."

== Career ==


=== Early appearances ===
Hamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as The Veil (playing an Indian), The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin, The Donna Reed Show and Cimarron City.
His first film role was a lead, Crime and Punishment U.S.A. (1959), directed by Denis Sanders. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year. However the film was seen by Vincente Minnelli who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in Home from the Hill (1960), a Southern melodrama with Robert Mitchum. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer signed him to a long-term contract.


=== Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ===
MGM cast Hamilton in support of Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner in the melodrama All the Fine Young Cannibals (1960) which flopped at the box office.
Hamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy Where the Boys Are (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.
Hamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted Angel Baby (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for Allied Artists. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For United Artists he supported Lana Turner in a melodrama, By Love Possessed (1961).
MGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, A Thunder of Drums (1961) alongside Richard Boone; the film was mildly popular.
Hamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in Light in the Piazza (1962), another melodrama, with Olivia de Havilland. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in Two Weeks in Another Town (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of The Bad and the Beautiful (1952).
Hamilton had an excellent part in The Victors (1963), an anti-war drama from Carl Foreman. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in Act One (1963), playing Moss Hart, but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre and Burke's Law.
After making a cameo in Looking for Love (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, Your Cheatin' Heart (1964), playing Hank Williams. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of The Rogues and Ben Casey.
Hamilton went to Mexico to support Jeanne Moreau and Brigitte Bardot in Viva Maria! (1965). It was directed by Louis Malle who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in Two Weeks in Another Town. Malle said, "he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns – I don't understand – when he should be one of the greatest of his generation." The film was popular in Europe, but less so in the US.
Hamilton made a movie in France, That Man George (1965), and appeared in a production of A Farewell to Arms (1966) on TV, opposite Vanessa Redgrave.
He returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with Sandra Dee, Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding! (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with Glenn Ford in a Western A Time for Killing (1967), originally directed by Roger Corman then Phil Karlson.
Hamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's Jack of Diamonds (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was "a hot commodity these days" because he was dating Lyndon Johnson's daughter. Reports put his fee around this time at $100,000 a movie. He was drafted into the army but received a 3-A deferral notice on the grounds he was the sole financial provider for his mother. (Hamilton's draft deferment was highly controversial at the time because it was thought that his relationship with the president's daughter gave him preferential treatment.)
In 1968 Hamilton made a science fiction film for George Pal at MGM, The Power.


=== Television ===
Hamilton went into television in 1969, supporting Lana Turner in the all-star ABC series Harold Robbins' The Survivors (1969–70).When the show was canceled in January 1970, Hamilton went into Paris 7000 (1970). He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.
He starred in the TV films Togetherness (1970) and The Last of the Powerseekers, a 1971 compilation of two episodes of Harold Robbins' The Survivors.


=== Producer ===
Hamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in Evel Knievel (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by John Milius who later called Hamilton "a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, "I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man."He appeared in a TV movie, The Last of the Powerseekers (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing, starring Burt Reynolds (1973).
He produced and appeared in Medusa (1973). He starred in the TV movie The Dead Don't Die (1975) and had a support role in Once Is Not Enough (1975). On a 1975 episode of Columbo, Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime.
Hamilton guest starred on episodes of Police Story, McCloud, Roots, The Eddie Capra Mysteries, Gibbsville, Supertrain, and Sword of Justice.
He had support roles in The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver (1977), The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington (1977), Killer on Board (1977), Sextette (1978), The Users (1978), From Hell to Victory (1979), Institute for Revenge (1979) and Death Car on the Freeway (1979).


=== Love at First Bite ===
In 1979 he appeared in surprise hit Love at First Bite, in which he showed a flair for comedy, which was the story of Count Dracula's pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by Susan Saint James. The film included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to "I Love the Nightlife" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.
He returned to TV for The Seekers (1979) and The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway (1979) then he did a Love at First Bite style comedy, 1981's Zorro, The Gay Blade, which he produced.
However, Zorro was not as popular as Love at First Bite and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: Malibu (1983) and Two Fathers' Justice (1985).
In the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC Aaron Spelling-produced nighttime television serial Dynasty.
He supported Joan Collins in the miniseries Monte Carlo (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series Spies (1987). He supported Elizabeth Taylor in Poker Alice (1987).
