Russell Charles Hitchcock (born 15 June 1949) is an Australian musician and lead vocalist of the soft rock duo Air Supply.


== Early life ==
Born in Melbourne, Hitchcock attended South Brunswick State School, and later studied at Princes Hill High School in Carlton North. In 1965, he left school to work as a salesman. At that time, he played the drums and was the lead vocalist in a band called "19th Generation". At the age of 20, Hitchcock obtained a job at a computer company where he continued work for three years, before being promoted and transferred to Sydney.


== Career ==
After meeting British musician Graham Russell in 1975 on the set of a production of Jesus Christ Superstar, Air Supply was formed. The group went on to have many hit records from 1976 into the 1990s; among their biggest hits are "All Out of Love", "The One That You Love", "Lost in Love" and "Making Love Out of Nothing at All".
After the band took a break in 1987, Hitchcock released several solo singles followed by his self-titled solo debut album in 1988. In 1990, the single "Swear to Your Heart" was released, which is from the soundtrack of the film Arachnophobia.
In 1991, Air Supply made a comeback with the album The Earth Is ... featuring the singles "Without You" and "Stronger Than the Night". In 1995, Hitchcock recorded a duet, "Is It You", with Rita Coolidge from her album Behind the Memories.
