== Early life ==
Eden was born on 11 July 1992 in Gosford Hospital in Gosford, New South Wales. She was raised in Wyoming, New South Wales. Her mother is Michele and her sister is Siana. From a young age, Eden and her sister were part of a foster aunty and uncle program, which gave their single mother Michele respite. One weekend a month (and often more often), they would stay with 'aunty' Marilyn and 'uncle' Frank. Eden's childhood was deeply affected by her family dysfunctions and issues of self-esteem. As the years passed, she did not always get along well with her mother, and at the age of 11, she began harming herself. During this time, she was diagnosed with agoraphobia and, at the age of 12, Eden finished school. It was around this time that Eden saw a Janis Joplin documentary on television and realised that maybe the raspy tones in her own voice weren't that bad after all.  "Hence began my obsession with everything Janis".
At around the age of 13, Eden was left in the care of Department of Community Services at Gosford by her mother, who was not coping. Eden spent her teenage years living in over 20 women's refuges as a state ward.  During this time, she reconnected with Aunty Marilyn and Uncle Frank who were both musicians. She recalled that her uncle Frank taught her everything about music and how to play the guitar. "When he first started teaching me how to play, I was playing traditional folk and bluegrass – now I play the double bass and I'm learning the banjo".

All four coaches opted to take Eden as one of their finalists; she eventually chose Seal as her coach and mentor. Eden progressed through to the Battle Rounds, where she was paired against contestant Paula Parore, singing Amy Winehouse's "Back to Black". As a result, Seal chose Eden as the winner of the battle and she progressed through to the Live Shows. Throughout this round, the coaches and audiences were impressed with Eden's performances of Rebecca Ferguson's "Nothing's Real but Love", Fleetwood Mac's "Landslide" and Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah".During the first part of the grand final, on 17 June 2012, Eden sang an original song entitled "I Was Your Girl", which she co-wrote with a friend, and a cover of Lorraine Ellison's "Stay with Me Baby".

After she was announced the winner, Eden performed her debut single "You Won't Let Me" for the first time. She was awarded a prize of $100,000, a Ford Focus car and a recording contract with Universal Music Australia.
