His inaugural EP on the label became the first from an artist other than Eric Prydz. The EP, consisting of lead track "Jackie" together with "Lauderdale" and "DLIGTY", went to number 1 on the overall Beatport Top 100 releases chart and ousted Aphex Twin from the top spot. It stayed at number 1 for 10 days.He has produced a number of remixes for other artists both in and outside of the electronic dance music space, including Tove Lo, Sailor & I, Dosem, Mendoza, Digitalism, Golden Girls, The Good Guys, Glenn Morrison, 16 Bit Lolitas, Adrian Lux and Henry Saiz.

The first release featured the long desired Taiga and Roots, as well as Pinkerton from Olander Essential Mix with Prydz and the previously unheard Falls.In late October 2016, he brought back the Vivrant party to his hometown with a lineup containing acts such as Henry Saiz, Finnebassen and Sweden native Charlie Don’t Surf. The sold out show was held at Nobelberget, a 1200 cap venue just outside Stockholm.Jeremy was nominated for Beatport Progressive House Artist of the Year in 2016.In May 2017, Olander hit a milestone in his career by releasing on John Digweed's well known imprint Bedrock Records. "Last Dance" produced together with Cristoph was Olander's first ever collab project, and stayed as number 1 for 10 days on the Beatport Progressive House chart and peaked at 29 on the overall chart. ”It’s definitely a dream come true”, Olander said about releasing on the label.Olander gave back to his supporters with a free event called ”Vivrant Open” in June 2017, where he played for eight hours, making it his longest set to date. The event was an open air at Amfiteatern in Långholmen and over 2000 people attended the event.Adding to his list of breakthroughs in 2017, Jeremy also got the chance to do his first residency at Sound Nightclub in Los Angeles. Previous Sound residents include Guy Gerber, Pete Tong and Marco Carola.Olander had his first label showcase at the yearly Amsterdam Dance Event in October 2017. Olander brought names like Marino Canal, Guy Mantzur, Khen, Tim Engelhardt and Ejeca with him, making the show one of the highlights of the year for the swede.
