== Early life ==
Born in Lampasas and raised in Fort Worth, Allison attended the Harvest Christian Academy in Watauga. She later moved to Los Angeles where she befriended Michael Jackson. She competed in the World Championships of Performing Arts in Burbank. She started singing at the age of three and after performing at DARE rallies aged ten, she built up a following via the internet after a friend set up a website for her and uploaded MP3s. This led to a record deal with 2KSounds, a division of Virgin Records.


== Career ==
In 2001, Allison's first single from her self-titled album, "The Kiss-Off (Goodbye)", peaked at number 28 on Billboard magazine's Hot Singles Sales chart. She toured with 98 Degrees on their Revelation tour in 2001. Her first album, Brooke Allison, which featured songwriting contributions from Mýa, Robert Palmer, and Meredith Brooks, was released in June that year on 2KSounds/Virgin. The album received negative reviews, with the Knight Ridder calling it "a classic exhibit of the pop music industry's assembly-line tendencies". She was recruited by AOL as a "Growing Up Advisor" for its Kids Only channel.Grammy Award-nominated record producer Michael Blakey produced four of Allison's songs for the original motion picture soundtrack Cinderella II: Dreams Come True and Disney's Princess Favorites. She planned to follow her debut with a rock album, but it never materialized.In 2008, she successfully auditioned to become a member of the new girl group called The Beach Girl5 along with Mandy Jiroux, Laura New, Dominique Domingo and Noreen Juliano. She went on tour with the BG5 in Europe and in the US. They released the single SCRATCH and appeared on the show Keeping Up with the Kardashians. After releasing two singles with the group, the group disbanded.
In August 2018, Brooke experienced medical issues and fell into a coma. Her family set up a GoFundMe to raise money for her care. It is listed under the name "Brooke Adams recovery fund".
