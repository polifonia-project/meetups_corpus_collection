=== 2015–2016: Early years ===
070 Shake was born in North Bergen, New Jersey and is of Dominican descent. Balbuena attended North Bergen High School, where she played on the school's basketball team. Prior to her music career, Shake wrote poetry. Shake began her music career in late 2015, recording the songs "Proud" and "Swervin". Shake's stage name is derived from her affiliation with the 070 music collective; 070 coming from New Jersey's 070 ZIP Codes. By 2018, the 070 crew was noted to have 11 members including artists and producers.By 2016, Shake was earning hundreds of thousands of streams on SoundCloud. Soon after posting several songs on SoundCloud, Shake attracted the attention of Miami-based promoter and social media personality YesJulz. After hearing "Proud" specifically, YesJulz reached out to Shake on Twitter, quickly signing on to be her manager. Shake broke through with "Trust Nobody", released early in that year. In August, Shake collaborated with fellow 070 members Ralphy River, Hack, and Tree on the single "Honey". The song featured production from frequent collaborators The Kompetition, a three-person production group. "Honey" simultaneously premiered on Complex and 1 AM Radio on Dash. Vibe commented that the track "[sounded] tailor made to rock on dance floors everywhere."Also in 2016, Shake signed with Kanye West's GOOD Music label. GOOD Music found out about Shake through Julz, as she played some of Shake's music at a Yeezy fitting, interesting the label's president, Pusha T. After signing Shake, the label picked up her "Trust Nobody" track and re-released it in September. Shake spent October and November opening up for English rock band The 1975 during the American leg of their 2016 tour. On December 8, 070 released their first mixtape, The 070 Project: Chapter 1.


=== 2017–present: Glitter, collaborations with Kanye West and Modus Vivendi ===
Shake modeled for Gypsy Sport's Fall 2017 runway show. She also went on her first headlining tour in April. In a 2017 interview with Paper, Shake mentioned her Yellow Girl EP would release later that year. However, the project was moved back to release after Glitter, another collaboration with The Kompetition.Her solo debut, the 6-track Glitter EP was released on March 23, 2018, although it was originally slated for a January 26 release and to include 12 tracks. At the time of Glitter's release, media outlets noted that her lyrical content concentrated on her self-esteem issues, drug use, and sexuality. Shake described Glitter as "about being in a dark place and finding yourself and figuring it out. It's about being in the lowest of lows type of shit." Shortly prior to Glitter's release, Shake performed at the SXSW music festival.In May, Shake was featured on "Santeria", a track from Pusha T's album Daytona. Shake also had featured vocals on "Ghost Town" and "Violent Crimes" from Kanye West's album Ye.Michael Sapanora praised the two tracks as "standout cuts" on the album, and ranked "Ghost Town" specifically as the album's best song. HotNewHipHop praised Shake's performance on "Ghost Town" as the highlight of the song, and called the track the climax of the album. Shake told Pigeons & Planes that "Ghost Town" was nearly left off Ye, as the track was finished on the same day of the album's release. "Ghost Town" also featured vocals from Kid Cudi, another inspiration of Shake's; she shared with Pigeons & Planes, "All my life I grew up listening to Kanye West and Kid Cudi. I've cried to their music. They've definitely changed my life, and saved me from a lot of stuff." Shake's recording experience with West in Wyoming for his Ye album impacted her thoughts about Yellow Girl; she stated "I don't know if it's going to be called Yellow Girl. I know the songs are definitely changing. The experience I had in Wyoming makes me want to make music on a different level."In 2019, she featured on DJ Khaled's album Father of Asahd alongside Buju Banton, Sizzla and Mavado on the song "Holy Mountain".
Shake released her debut album, Modus Vivendi, on January 17, 2020. Her second studio album, You Can't Kill Me Because I Don't Exist is planned for release in early 2022. Its first single, "Lose My Cool" featuring NLE Choppa, was released on December 3, 2021.
