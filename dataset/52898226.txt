== Genius Is Common ==
Genius is Common means that all beings have a genius in them... An example can be a woman that comes from the inner city, who knows how to micro braid hair, as Picasso painted; that skill is her genius. What makes the slogan “Genius is Common” so unique, is the fact that in few words it levels the playing field of who is traditionally thought of as geniuses, such as Albert Einstein."-Bruce George

"It’s imperative that these spoken word artists be catapulted to the mainstream and be recognized. Finally the marriage between hip-hop and spoken word can begin the arduous task of reconciliation."
—Bruce George
