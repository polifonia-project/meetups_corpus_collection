== Music career ==


=== 2012–2015: Beginnings ===
Diamond met GFOTY through a friend, and GFOTY introduced her to A. G. Cook. After a vocalist failed to show up to a session with Cook, the two worked on their first musical collaboration. In 2012, they recorded Diamond's first solo song, titled "Attachment". Diamond released her debut single "Pink and Blue" through PC Music in October 2013. The song resembles a lullaby, with a harshly synthetic quality. The attention received by "Pink and Blue" helped to introduce the fledgling label, and it placed 5th on Fact's list of "The 100 best tracks of the decade so far".The following January, Diamond appeared on A. G. Cook's "Keri Baby". The song toyed with the idea of Diamond as an MP3 file or a digital entity on a screen. Diamond made her first live performance in April, at Basement in London. She released "Attachment" as her second single later that month. "Attachment" is a melancholy ballad about modern relationships, with a high-pitched melody backed by farcical harmonies.
Diamond's third solo single "Every Night" was released in November 2014 and became PC Music's first single available through the iTunes Store. The song discusses feelings of desire and showcases a more bold personality than Diamond's earlier songs. Her vocals are childlike and staccato, supported by "oh-ooh-oh" harmonies. The production drew comparisons to La Bouche and "Call Me Maybe" by Carly Rae Jepsen. "Every Night" received nearly 200,000 plays on SoundCloud within two weeks, and it became Diamond's first song to appear on a Billboard chart, reaching 28th on the Emerging Artists chart.March 2015 saw Diamond head to the US to play the PC Music showcase at the Empire Garage in Austin, Texas as part of SXSW. Her performance was very well received with The Guardian calling it a "well-crafted performance, as much about the aesthetic and choreography as the camp songs" and according to Flavorwire was the one "who impressed the most." On 8 May 2015, Diamond performed as part of a PC Music show at BRIC House in Brooklyn, New York as part of the Red Bull Music Academy Festival. The show was billed as the premiere of Pop Cube, "a multimedia reality network". In November 2015, Diamond released her song "Hi" with a music video made in conjunction with i-D magazine. After having the resources to produce her first music video, she selected "Hi" as a "way of tying up my older material, and a good way of introducing my next phase". Diamond had begun recording a full-length album, originally planned for release in 2015.


=== 2016–2021: Reflections ===
February 2016 saw Hannah Diamond collaborate with Charli XCX on a new track titled "Paradise", which featured on XCX's Vroom Vroom EP, the first release on XCX's label Vroom Vroom Recordings. According to the singer, the label will combine her "love for bubblegum pop with mystery and darkness." In October that year, Diamond released the new single "Fade Away" with a lyric video via PC Music. On 22 December 2016, Diamond released a free single, "Make Believe", which was produced by easyFun and A.G. Cook.On 13 December 2017, she released a new mix, Soon I won't see you at all, which contains three new tracks, one of which is a cover of "Concrete Angel" by Gareth Emery.

On 16 November 2018, Diamond released "True", which is the lead single from her debut album Reflections.On 17 September 2019, Diamond released the song "Part of Me" with Danny L Harle.
