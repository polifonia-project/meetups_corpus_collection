Jeremy Miles Ferguson,  (born January 7, 1981) better known by the stage name Jinxx, is an American musician best known as guitarist, violinist, cellist, pianist, songwriter, and composer of American rock band Black Veil Brides.


== History ==
Jinxx joined Black Veil Brides in mid-2009 when Andy Biersack was forming his band in Hollywood, California. He had also played in bands The Dreaming, Amen, among others. He got his first guitar when he was two, and started playing live shows with his father at age eight, playing in local bars in Iowa. He is influenced by classical composers Bach and Beethoven. The first album he ever owned was Metallica's fourth album, ...And Justice for All, and he learned to play every track. He and fellow Black Veil Brides guitarist Jake Pitts won Revolver Magazine's Golden Gods Award for "Best Guitarists 2012". He has cited major influences such as Randy Rhoads, Metallica, Megadeth, Danny Elfman, Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Domenico Scarlatti.

On December 2, 2019, Jinxx made a post on his Instagram confirming that he has epilepsy. A day later he posted another message thanking everyone for the positive response he received after revealing it. He has since run a few auctions of some of his Black Veil Brides tour memorabilia from which some of the proceeds were donated to the Epilepsy Foundation. Jinxx was diagnosed with epilepsy at 27 years old, after experiencing a tonic clonic seizure on stage, Jinxx struggled for years to find the medication that worked for him, but he has now been seizure free since August 2019.
