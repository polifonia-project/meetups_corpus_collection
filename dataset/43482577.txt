Lorin Morgan-Richards (born 16 February 1975) is an American author, illustrator, and songwriter, primarily known for his young adult fiction and Weird West series The Goodbye Family.In the past, Richards served as the publisher of Celtic Family Magazine, and was the founder of the Los Angeles St. David's Day Festival, one of the largest Welsh festivals of its kind in the United States.
Morgan-Richards was born in Beebetown, Ohio, and is of Swiss (Amish) and Welsh descent.


== Early years ==
Richards was raised in an old converted one-room schoolhouse in Beebetown, Ohio, that had a well for water. His mother (a student of fine art) taught him the basics of drawing and music composition on the family pump organ. Richards also credited his imagination on the plentiful books his family owned, creative isolation, and the sheer number of animals they took care of, many of which he incorporated into his early drawings and writings.Richards interest in Native American and American Western history began in childhood. "I remember my first book as a child was The Indians Knew by Tillie S. Pine, an early reader from 1965 explaining the cultural ways and historical resourcefulness of Native Americans and how they are applied in the sciences today."When Richards entered second grade, he was diagnosed with a form of dyslexia that required tutoring through the ninth grade. By his early teens, he was reading and became inspired by Edward Lear, L. Frank Baum, Roald Dahl, and Lewis Carroll; helping him overcome his reading disability.


== Theater ==
Between 1993-2003, Richards received an AA Degree in Liberal Arts at Cuyahoga Community College and credited his Anthropology Professor Mark Lewine as a mentor. During this time, Richards also achieved minor success in producing music projects containing modern dance and theater, and befriended and collaborated with artist Textbeak. "I first attended Tri-C Western campus where my focus was on Liberal Arts. At the time, I kept a journal of random thoughts, doodles, and lyrics and used the filter of music as my art. So, the bulk of my classes were in this field of study. I made connections with other artists who shared similar passions, and we were all eager to form various projects of expression. I moved to Lakewood to be closer to the performance spaces and switched to Tri-C Metro where I was awakened out of my shell by an Anthropology teacher named Dr. Mark Lewine." In 1999, Richards solo album ENKI and subsequent live production were based on Zecharia Sitchin's book The Twelfth Planet. The show premiered in Cleveland, Ohio under the choreography of Michael Medcalf. Native American musical act Shouting Mountain opened the evening. In 2001, Richards followed the success of ENKI with the production of An Occurrence Remembered, influenced by the metaphysical war writings of Ambrose Bierce. The performance premiered in New York City. Richards reflects on the performance: "Rehearsals were underway when 9-11 happened and I recall we continued only for our own therapy of the situation, knowing theater-goers were not going out. It was a tremendous performance, but it financially broke me."Richards calls his synth music "Dark Electronic Storytelling" as it is conceptually based on written works and is meant for dramatic performance.Richards announced on social media in June 2018 that he was re-releasing previous albums and upcoming tracks under the new moniker Elder Moon.


== Writing career ==
In 2002, Richards moved to Los Angeles to start over where he refocused his artistic direction into writing and illustrating, which he said: "did not need the expenses of my past but only a pen and paper." While his novel Me’ma and the Great Mountain (2012) began drafts as early as 2002, it was Simon Snootle and Other Small Stories that became his first book release in 2009.The following year Richards delivered four new releases including his second book of short stories in A Boy Born from Mold and Other Delectable Morsels.

Richards conceptualized most of The Goodbye Family characters in 2009 during a trip to the UK and France with his wife, although they were mentioned before this in his western novel Me’ma and the Great Mountain. Richards explains "I took a diary on the trip in order to write my second novel The Goodbye Family.
The Goodbye family consisted of undertakers Otis and Pyridine, their daughter Orphie and her pet tarantula Dorian. Orphie was first seen atop the Notre Dame Cathedral with gargoyles, Otis was trying to board a train at customs with a shrunken head, Pyridine was sewing a limb back together in Cardiff, and Dorian was capturing a fairy to eat. Following these illustrations, a cat Ouiji was unveiled and Orphie is said to have a brother named Kepla, but he is hardly ever seen and it is unclear if he even exists."Between 2009 and 2013, Richards was bookbinding his limited edition versions of each title with runs equaling 50 to 400. These collectible books were typically oversewn by hand with a faux leather hard backing and linen pages inside. In an interview he states:
"Having seen what is being printed by majors these days with poor quality paper, I wanted to provide the reader with a book that carries more value near the same price and that can last for generations. Nothing would be more inspiring to me than to know my books are treasured like an heirloom."
Stylistically, Richards prefers a pencil and ink approach to his illustrations, and his writing often has elements of dark satire. Many of his stories also have a strong environmental message.
Between 2015 and 2018 Richards ran two weekly cartoons on Steamkat, a comic strip site, The Goodbye Family and The Noodle Rut. Richards won the 2016 Official Tasty Nugget award for his illustrated story Sad Lost Doll.  Since 2018, Richards has syndicated his series The Goodbye Family on Tapas as well as through his social media. In 2021, Richards created The Goodbye Family: The Animated Series.


=== The Goodbye Family ===

Since 2017, Richards has released his comic collections on a nearly quarterly basis, growing his audience, and solely focusing on The Goodbye Family and his Weird West brand. In an interview in 2019, he announced an early 2020 release of his second novel The Goodbye Family and the Great Mountain saying:

It follows the lives of Weird West undertakers Otis, Pyridine, and their daughter Orphie. Pyridine is a witch and matriarch mortician, Otis is a brainless but bold hearse driver, and Orphie is appointed grave digger for her strength of twenty men. Through bumbling Otis discovers his neighbors are turning into zombies, a mystery that is directly affecting their burial business. In their backyard cemetery they travel to the underworld for answers and uncover a plot to surface the evil entities, that would otherwise burn in the Lake of Fire, have risen again through oil pumps that are being bottled as a tonic medicine for the ground above. The tonic is consumed and the host fully takes over the body when the body perishes. Can the Goodbyes hilarious gaffes and revelations plug up the works?


== A Raven Above Press ==
A Raven Above Press was founded in 2009 by Richards with a focus on printing his illustrated stories and promoting other authors and illustrators of Celtic and Native American origin. The press also became a catalyst for producing cultural events and art exhibits. Notably, the Los Angeles St. David's Day Festival. On 1 August 2013, Celtic Family Magazine hit the newsstands with a release party in Cardiff, Wales. Richards was the founder and publisher of Celtic Family Magazine from its inception in 2013 to its hiatus in 2017.
The logo for A Raven Above Press displays a raven atop a bending cypress tree. Model Wednesday Mourning appeared in the main ad for A Raven Above Press, as well as Richards daughter Berlin in her traditional Welsh dress.
Richards would produce a book for every Welsh event he curated through A Raven Above Press. Outside of including his own illustration, these books often had American and Welsh artists depict the subject matter. Notable artists involved were Jen Delyth, Ruth Jên, Siobhan Owen, Monica Richards, Nichola and Sarah Hope, and Nathan Wyburn to name a few. The following is a list of these books: 

A Welsh Alphabet by Lorin Morgan-Richards and Peter Anthony Freeman (2010) in conjunction with the 2011 West Coast Eisteddfod.
The Children's Voice: A Definitive Collection of Welsh Nursery Rhymes by Peter Anthony Freeman (2012) in conjunction with the 2012 Los Angeles St. David's Day Festival.
The Age of Saints by Peter Anthony Freeman (2013) in conjunction with the 2013 Los Angeles St. David's Day Festival.
Welsh in the Old West by Lorin Morgan-Richards (2015) created for but released after the 2014 Los Angeles St. David's Day Festival.


=== Native American Involvement ===
 Richards speaking on the history books he read in grade school: "Usually the pictures told much more about American history than the text. I remembered seeing at a very early age a glowing photo of Custer and a few pages after (of) an elderly man, who looked like my own grandfather, lying dead in the snow. He was alone, and without care. I later found out his name was Miniconjou chief Spotted Elk (Bigfoot) and he was part of the massacre at Wounded Knee. That photo has always stuck with me. I knew something was not right, and the text which was alongside it was not giving the full story."


==== Bringing the Circle Together ====

 Between 2008 and 2012, Richards partnered with Native American and Indigenous groups in Los Angeles to establish Bringing the Circle Together, a free monthly film series hosted at the Japanese American National Museum. The series offered a central gathering place to screen documentaries by and about Indigenous people while providing historical narratives with guest speakers, and art and cultural demonstrations. Special guests included Makana, Saginaw Grant, Douglas Miles, Blase Bonpane, among others.
The film series in partnership with AIM Santa Barbara held a community birthday celebration at Nahui Ohlin in Los Angeles for Leonard Peltier on 12 September 2009, with an update on his status and how the public could get involved to petition his release. Richards spoke to a reporter: "This is all grassroots. Everyone's voice counts. The time is now because Barack Obama, our president, had said it's not the president that actually makes the change, it's going to be our pressure upon the president that will make the change." The event was followed in December by a screening of Warrior: The Life of Leonard Peltier with discussion afterward by Ben Carnes, members of AIM Santa Barbara, as well as friends and family.History was made at the film series on 25 February 2010, at the screening of Lost Nation: The Ioway when representatives of the Southern Ioway and Northern Ioway tribes gathered with Tongva leaders, making it the first time a meeting took place between Southern California and Midwestern Native American Nations.


=== Celtic involvement ===

Richards became heavily involved in the Welsh-American community after the closure of the Welsh Presbyterian Church in December 2012. Before this, Richards had helped coordinate an Eisteddfod at Barnsdall Art Park in 2011. Feeling a need to fill the void of losing the church as a cultural center, Richards founded the Los Angeles St. David's Day Festival, an annual event taking place on or around 1 March celebrating Wales. The first festival took place on 1 March 2013. Singer and harpist Siobhan Owen headlined the large-scale event. In conjunction with the festival, Richards began producing Celtic Family Magazine, a nationally distributed print and digital publication on Celtic interests.


== Imperfectualism ==
Imperfectualism is an anti-art treatise by Lorin Morgan-Richards, using the pen name Marcil d’Hirson Garron, and first published in January 2020. Richards defines Impefectualism as art that cannot be easily replicated by machine. An imperfectualist looks to slow automation through their art. The theme of Imperfectualism is the art of being imperfect. Richards used automatic drawing as a means of producing the work where conscious control is suppressed.


== Personal life ==


=== Beliefs ===
Richards considers himself a Spiritualist, stating that:
After a lifetime of witnessing spirit communication and most remarkably of that spirit I have seen firsthand, some in very close proximity, I feel I need to announce my path closely aligns with Spiritualism, or more precisely Spiritism and its view of reincarnation. In relation to his art, Richards states: My imagination helps see the past come to life as if watching a theater production put on by spirits.
