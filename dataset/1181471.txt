Growing up, Veirs heard folk-country, classical, and pop music at home; however, she didn't "listen seriously," she says, until her 20s.At Carleton, she joined all-girl punk band Rair Kx! After graduation, her taste moved to older country and folk, and during her time in China she began writing lyrics.In 1999, Veirs released a self-titled album, which was recorded live and featuring just herself and guitar. 2003 saw the release of Troubled by the Fire, accompanied by veteran musicians such as Bill Frisell. She then signed to Nonesuch and released Carbon Glacier. She also signed to Bella Union for European distribution. Year of Meteors followed in August 2005, and was selected by the New York Times as a "critic's choice".Veirs released her last full-length for Nonesuch, Saltbreakers, in 2007.
In January 2010, Veirs released July Flame on her own Raven Marching Band Records. The album received praise from the Washington Post among other publications.In November 2011, Veirs released the album Tumble Bee: Laura Veirs Sings Folk Songs for Children. The album presents mostly traditional songs, and features an array of guest musicians, including Colin Meloy, Jim James and Bela Fleck. Tumble Bee won a Parents' Choice Award in 2012.In September 2012, her first feature film soundtrack was released: Hello I Must Be Going. The exclusive soundtrack features eight instrumental versions of previously released songs, five catalog favorites and one new vocal track, "Spring Song".
In August 2013, she released Warp & Weft. In 2015, she worked on the album Carrie and Lowell by Sufjan Stevens. Veirs' 
long term collaborator Tucker Martine engineered some of the album.

The album received positive reviews and a Metacritic rating of 82.In April 2018, she released her 10th studio album The Lookout on her own label Raven Marching Band in North American and Bella Union in the rest of the world.  It is a concept album about the fragility of precious things.  It features contributions from Sufjan Stevens, Jim James and was produced by Tucker Martine.

Also in early 2018 Chronicle Books published her first picture book, Libba: The Magnificent Musical Life of Elizabeth Cotten.

== Style ==
In 2007, Veirs said about her lyrics, "I like to be personal in my writing, but not overly confessional."Many of her lyrics are inspired by literary works. The song "Saltbreakers" on the 2007 record Saltbreakers was partially inspired by A. S. Byatt's Possession. Another song on the same album, "Don't lose yourself", was partially inspired by Jose Saramago's novel, Blindness. T.S. Eliot was an inspiration for the song "Margaret Sands" on The Lookout.
