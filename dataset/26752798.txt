The Mass Missile
(ザ マス ミサイル) was formed in September 2000 in Tokyo.
In 2002 the band released their first album independently: Kyoukasho.
Soon after that they made their first tour in Japan.
After the success of the first album they released the mini album Nakama no Uta by Small World Records label in 2003.
In 2004 they signed with Sony Music. That same year they released their first album on a major label: Ningen de Yokatta.
