Shortly after Melcher's death, Day discovered that he had committed her to a CBS situation comedy, The Doris Day Show, without consulting with her. He had also embezzled millions of dollars that she had earned throughout their marriage because of poor investments and had left her deeply in debt. Day sued Melcher's business partner Jerome B. Rosenthal and was awarded nearly $23 million for fraud and malpractice following a 99-day trial. Rosenthal declared bankruptcy, and in August 1977 Day settled with his insurers for $6 million, which was paid in 23 annual installments.
