Here comes the Cities Service Band of America, conducted by Paul Lavalle!"

In 1949, Lavalle and the band became one of the first musical groups to appear weekly on television.
On May 18, 1961, Paul Lavalle and the Greatest Band in America joined singer Kay Armen in a 30-minute episode of the ABC-TV series "Music For a Spring Night" entitled "Concert in the Park." The Band opened with a spirited medley ("76 Trombones," "Strike Up the Band,") and then Miss Armen took over with "I'll Be Seeing You" and other songs. Beginning in 1964, the Band of America toured extensively and also became the official band of the 1964 New York World's Fair, an engagement that lasted into 1965.
Lavalle guest conducted many orchestras, including the ABC Symphony, CBS Symphony, NBC Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic and Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1966 he became the conductor for the Radio City Music Hall Symphony Orchestra, and he returned two years later to serve as director of music and as principal conductor until 1975.

They had one son, Lawrence (Larry) Usifer (5 October 1941 - 11 December 2002).  The marriage ended in divorce in 1946.

Paul Lavalle used his birth name, Joseph Usifer, for performances until at least 1938, and he then used the name Paul Laval in the 1940s. In 1938, a rare Brunswick Records 78rpm recording was issued under Joe Usifer's name, an extremely sophisticated and intricate swing arrangement, in the tradition of Raymond Scott, of "In The Hall of the Mountain King" b/w "The Jockey On The Carousel". Recorded by Irving Mills, it was one of the first records issued on Brunswick after the collapse of Mills' Master Records label (remaining top selling Master records were moved to Brunswick).
