== Legal issues ==
In July 2013, DeGruy was arrested for attempted first-degree murder in Chalmette and two counts of armed robbery. DeGruy was arrested in the Oakland, California, area recently by a U.S. Marshal's task force and was returned to Chalmette for prosecution after waiving extradition. DeGruy had fled to California after arrest warrants alleged that he had shot at, and narrowly missed, a man he knew on April 29. He allegedly had beaten and robbed two men of cash and their cell phones. DeGruy was released from the St. Bernard Parish Sheriff Office in December 2013.In May 2015, DeGruy and two others were indicted for the double murder of brothers, Kendrick and Kendred Bishop. New Orleans police took DeGruy into custody on September 25 along with his girlfriend, Jamya Brady, who was accused of helping him elude cops. Police say DeGruy dropped his cell phone at the murder scene and returned with a lie about dropping the device. He later changed up his story, according to The Advocate. Alleged accomplice Jonathan "Lil Joe" Evans, who is also charged in the murder indictment, has been behind bars since July 2015. The fourth suspect, Chantell Edwards, faces accessory to murder charges, though police have yet to track her down. Evans and DeGruy were reportedly identified through surveillance video from the crime scene. Both men gave fake names upon their arrest.  His bail has been set at $3.5 million.In May 2019, Flow was found guilty of two counts of second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit second-degree murder by a jury vote of 11:1, and he was sentenced to life in prison. He was tried separately for obstruction of justice and conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice, to which he pled guilty.On April 20, 2020, the United States Supreme Court in Ramos v. Louisiana, overruled a line of Louisiana jurisprudence and held that a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, as applied to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, requires a unanimous jury verdict for a state felony conviction. This rule applies retroactively to all criminal cases properly preserved for review at the time Ramos was decided. In the wake of the results of this Supreme Court ruling, DeGruy submitted an appeal to his sentencing in October 2020, which resulted in his second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit second-degree murder charges being dropped. DeGruy is currently serving a forty-year and thirty-year sentence to imprisonment at hard labor for his obstruction of justice and conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice charges, respectively.
