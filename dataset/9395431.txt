=== Bands ===
Singer formed New York hardcore band Crown of Thornz in 1994 with former Breakdown guitarist Mike Dijan, Dimi on drums, Steve O'Brien and Franklin Rhi on bass. In 1995, the band released their debut EP Train Yard Blues on Equal Vision Records, a dedication to Singer's younger brother David, who had committed suicide the previous year. The following year the group released Mentally Vexed. After their hiatus from 1998 to 2013, Crown of Thornz reunited at Ieperfest in Belgium and This Is Hardcore in Philadelphia, and went on a North American tour with Rancid and The Transplants.
After Crown of Thornz, Singer decided to set a new trend with his street blend of hardcore, metal, hip hop and punk, founding a new music genre he calls thugcore, with the band Skarhead. The band consisted of Madball's guitarists Brian "Mitts" Daniels and Hoya Roc, former White Trash bassist Aaron "White Owl" Collins, Murphy's Law's and  Misfits' drummer Eric "Goat" Arce, and Puerto Rican Mike from District 9. Skarhead's debut Drugs, Money & Sex EP was released in 1997. The band soon signed to Victory Records for the release of the New York hardcore record Kings at Crime, which hit stores in 1999. The band also had success with their sophomore LP Drugs, Music & Sex, released in 2009. In 2011, European label I Scream Records released the album Dreams Don't Die, Skarhead's tribute to some of Singer's favorite bands from the era between 1986 and 1989.
In 1996, Singer collaborated with Jamey Jasta to form the metalcore band Icepick, which served as a side project of Hatebreed. Along with their bandmates Derek Kerswill, Wayne Lozinak and Frank Novinec, the group remained virtually stagnant until the song "Born to Crush You" appeared on UFC: Ultimate Beat Downs, Vol. 1 in August 2004. Former UFC heavyweight champion Andrei Arlovski frequently uses their song "Onward to Victory" as his entrance music for fights. Icepick's debut album, Violent Epiphany, was released on April 18, 2006 under Jasta's record label Stillborn Records.Singer's current band is The Wilding Incident, which also features Jimmy Williams of Nausea/Maximum Penalty.


=== Solo ===
Singer's first solo recording began with "D.R.E.A.M." by The Transplants, which mentioned him to sign with Travis Barker of Blink-182's LaSalle Records for the 2005 release of his Hardcore 4 Life EP. Diablo included some of its tracks on Thugcore 4 Life record released in 2007, featuring the Tim Armstrong-produced track "Living By The Gun". His friendship with Armstrong remained, and he moved to Epitaph Records and signed with Tim's Hellcat Records to release his sophomore solo album International Hardcore Superstar in 2009, with guest appearances by La Coka Nostra members, Vinnie Paz, Sick Jacken and Tim himself.
In early 2012, Singer founded his own independent record label, ILL-ROC Records and released his third album, The Blood Of Eden, which featured Madchild, Bizarre, Adil Omar, and the ILL-ROC roster. He went to Paris and released his fourth album, Dollerz Make Sense, in 2016 via Knives Out Records.
