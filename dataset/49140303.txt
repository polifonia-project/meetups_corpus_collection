Her father had served as a Hanoverian ambassador and was a pianist linked to Frédéric Chopin and Charles-Valentin Alkan. Although a Protestant, she married the Catholic Heinrich von Herzogenberg. She is known in large part for her association with Johannes Brahms. As an aristocratic musician, she largely did not perform or publish for the public, but did arrange children's folk songs. Ethel Smyth devoted chapter XX of her Impressions That Remained: Memoirs to her.
