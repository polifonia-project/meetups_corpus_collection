Mandy Miller (born Carmen Isabella Miller, 23 July 1944) is an English child actress who made a number of films in the 1950s and is probably best remembered for her recording of the 1956 song "Nellie the Elephant".


== Early life ==
She was christened Carmen but called Mandy by her family. Her career tended to involve serious acting roles rather than comedy, even in her first small part in The Man in the White Suit, where she was a sad-faced little girl who helped Alec Guinness escape from his pursuers.
She put in a much-praised performance in her second film, another Ealing production, Mandy (1952), playing a deaf-mute child whose parents (played by Terence Morgan and Phyllis Calvert) did not know how to cope with bringing her up. This briefly made her a leading actor.Her next film was Background (1953), with two other child actors, in a film about a family breaking up because of an impending divorce. Like Mandy, this was a drama about a well-to-do middle-class family; Valerie Hobson played her mother.
In 1954, she had a starring role in Adventure in the Hopfields, a film made for the Children's Film Foundation.
She also had lighter roles, such as in Raising a Riot (1955) starring Kenneth More. Some of her other co-stars were Joan Greenwood, Cecil Parker, Godfrey Tearle, Thora Hird and Sam Wanamaker. Miller also made two popular single records: "Snowflakes" and "Nellie the Elephant".
She also appeared in television dramas.


== Personal life ==
In 1962, at the age of 18, Miller moved to New York City to become an au pair. In 1965, she married Christopher Davey, an architect, and had three children (two girls and a boy). She lives in retirement in Britain.
She is the aunt of actress Amanda Pays.
