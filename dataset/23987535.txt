== Music career ==


=== Failure ===

Edwards' first band  was the Los Angeles-based Failure. That band was active from 1990 until 1997, when bandmate Ken Andrews dissolved the band, citing personal differences. The band re-formed in 2014 with drummer Kellii Scott and embarked on a North American tour before releasing new material in the form of The Heart is a Monster in 2015 followed by 2018's In the Future Your Body Will Be the Furthest Thing from Your Mind.


=== Replicants ===

After the completion of Failure's last studio album before the band officially dissolved, Edwards, along with bandmate Ken Andrews, former Tool bassist Paul D'Amour, and multi-instrumentalist Chris Pitman, formed the cover band Replicants. They released one self-titled record, Replicants in 1996.


=== Lusk ===

Following the release of Replicants and the dissolution of Failure, Paul D'Amour, Brad Laner, and Chris Pitman formed the band Lusk. Lusk released one album, Free Mars. Edwards played extensively on the first half of the album, contributing vocals, guitar, bass, drums, and synthesizers. Free Mars would go on to be nominated for a Grammy for Best Recording Package in 1997.


=== Autolux ===

Formed in 2000, with Carla Azar and Eugene Goreshter, Autolux is Edwards' current band. They have recorded one promotional EP, Demonstration, and released three full-length studio albums, Future Perfect, in 2004, Transit Transit in August 2010, and Pussy's Dead in March 2016.
