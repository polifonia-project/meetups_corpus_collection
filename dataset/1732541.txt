Stacey David Blades is a guitarist originally from Toronto Canada, who has played with such bands as Fraidy Katt, Roxx Gang, Supercool, L.A. Guns, and Electric Radio Kings. He has played on the L.A. Guns studio albums Rips the Covers Off, Tales from the Strip, Covered in Guns, and Hollywood Forever, and the L.A. Guns live album Loud and Dangerous: Live from Hollywood.

In 2009, Blades released his first guitar instrumental solo album called "Symphonic Slam" on Cleopatra Records.
At the end of 2012, Blades decided to leave L.A. Guns to pursue more personal opportunities for performing and songwriting. He worked with Sony Music designing and writing guitar loop packages. Blades was also the last artist to work with the legendary producer Andy Johns before his untimely death in April 2013. From 2017 to 2020 Stacey achieved some success with his active rock band "Electric Radio Kings" charting #28 on Billboard Mainstream Rock charts with their remake of Amy Winehouse's "Back To Black" and released a full length album "Purrr" produced by longtime Metallica engineer Michael Gillies. The album was released via MI5/Universal. The band however imploded and turned into the amazing alternative "Crashing Wayward" who released their first single "Breathe" on February 12th, 2021 again produced by Mike Gillies (Metmixer).
