In Los Angeles, Page and Steve George, a friend from Phoenix, “knocked around the LA music scene, eventually working with topflight acts like REO Speedwagon, Andy Gibb, Al Jarreau, and Kenny Loggins.” Page turned down an offer to be the lead singer for the bands Chicago and Toto. Page's first major band, Pages, was formed with Steve George in the late 1970s.After producing three "Pages" albums, Page and George formed Mr. Mister along with Steve Farris and Pat Mastelotto. Page was on vocals/bass, George handled keyboards, Farris played guitar, and Mastelotto was on drums. Page is best known for his work with Mr. Mister. The band's first album was I Wear The Face (1984). Page has said that in this album the band was "just getting together and figuring out" how they wanted to sound.

As frontman for Mr. Mister, Page scored two consecutive Hot 100 No. 1's with the singles "Broken Wings" and "Kyrie", both of which Page composed in collaboration with his cousin, John Lang. Both songs were released in 1985 and appeared on Mr. Mister's breakthrough second album, Welcome to the Real World, which also came out in 1985 and reached No. 1 on the albums charts. The group was nominated for several Grammy Awards, including Best Pop Band in 1986. The band scored another hit with "Is It Love" (1986), which reached no. 8 in the charts.Mr. Mister's third album, Go On… was released in 1987. In an interview, Page said that the band "tried many new and different sounds and ideas" and that it included some of the band's best songwriting. Before breaking up on September 25, 1990, the group recorded a fourth Mr. Mister album, Pull, in 1989. The album was not released until 2010.  Page has described "Pull" (2010) as the group's "most experimental album."Many of Page's songs for Mr. Mister, and many of his solo numbers, were co-written with Steve George and John Lang.Page has also been a solo artist, and he has worked as a background singer for other artists and bands.
