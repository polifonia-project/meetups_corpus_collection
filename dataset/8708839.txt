Since 2007 he has been touring and DJing across the UK and Europe, including performances at Glastonbury, Hip Hop Kemp, The Big Chill, Bestival and the Jazz Cafe. He has also work on a number of side projects, including Lingua Franca and Invisible Inc, a synth/electronic hip hop project with Kashmere and Verb T.
His debut album Seldom Seen Often Heard was described by Rapnews as "a great release which certainly provides value of money and a lot of playback moments". A single from the album, 2006's "Basic Instinct" featured vocals from Abstract Rude. Alternate versions of Ghost's first two albums have been released in Japan. His tracks have been included on several mix CDs and compilations, including DJ Yoda's Fabric Live mix.
