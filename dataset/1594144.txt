== Biography ==


=== 2001–04: Debut album, Do Meu Jeito and live album ===

Key released her first, self-titled album in 2001 at the age of 17. Her first single was the song "Escondido" ("Hidden") in which she sang the suggestive lyrics 'We went out to make out and to make love'. The song received much airplay thanks to her then-boyfriend, Brazilian funk singer Latino, who she had dated for years, and the risqué lyrics.
Her big breakthrough was the song "Baba" ("Drool") which was the biggest hit in the country during 2001 and 2002. In the controversial song and music video, Kelly provokes an older man that ignored her when she was young and infatuated with him, but now that she's older, is sexually attracted to her. Thanks to the success of the song, the album went 2x platinum in Brazil and selling over 500.000 copies. In 2002 was released to international markets. Furthermore, Key's first two singles comprised highly explicit sexual content; although, the albums appealed predominantly to minors. The album would later tender two more successful singles: Cachorrinho ("Little Dog"), about a petulant man and his eventual apprehension of the reality of his relationship with his female boss, and "Anjo" ("Angel"), a sad ballad. Both songs received major airplay and were big radio hits.

She spawned a doll, a shoes line and many other products targeted at young girls during her early years. In the same year, Kelly received substantial exposure after appearing on the covers of various gossip magazines due to her divorce with Latino, which did not end amicably, and participation in a recent Playboy exposé. In 2002 was released Kelly Key en Español, a Spanish version of the debut album only in Latin America, selling a 50,000 copies, and also was released Remix Hits, a remix album for the LGBT clubs, selling 100,000 copies worldwide. On 2003 saw the release of Key's second album Do Meu Jeito (en: My Way). Following "Baba"'s legacy, the album's first single, "Adoleta", recited Key's difficult relationship with a younger man. Key also released "Chic Chic", song about the fame. The album sold 300,000 copies in Brazil.

In 2006 she released her last album on the Warner Music label, Por Que Não? (English: Why Not?), selling 45,000 copies. The album spawned the hits "Pegue e Puxe" ("Reach and Pull"), "Shake Boom" and "Analista" ("Analyst").
In 2007 Key released her first compilation, 100% Kelly Key, by Som Livre Records, her new label, selling 50,000 copies. The album released the smash "Você é o Cara" ("You're the Dude"), reaching her seventh number one single in Brazil.
