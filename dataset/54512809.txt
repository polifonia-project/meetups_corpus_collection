== Early life ==
Farelo was born in Vilassar de Mar, Spain, the eldest of five children, daughter of the actor and dubbing actor Eduard Farelo. He worked for international productions such as The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. After taking selectividad, Farelo studied a degree in fashion design at the University of Barcelona. While attending university and working at a call centre, she released "Pai" in April 2016, an adaptation of "Work" by Rihanna, adapting the lyrics to a mixture of Spanish, Catalan and English. She stated that she never meant for that song to become viral and that she just did it to create a funny memory with her friend group. However, with that video Farelo became one of the first artists to sing typically Latin music genres in Catalan and was named one of the biggest musical promises in Spain after the cover was picked up by a local radio. While working in a bakery in her hometown, she decided to drop out of college to pursue a serious career in the music industry. She began as an independent artist singing covers and playing music in nightclubs in the province of Barcelona. She later became more interested in producing her own music and, with the money she made out of these gigs, she rented recording studios for limited hours and hired some producers. She would then release "Indapanden", "No Pierdo Nada" among other songs produced by Fake Guido.

=== 2016–2018: Slow Wine Mixtape and Worldwide Angel ===
"Pai" gained popularity on YouTube, and was picked up by a local radio, which led to the creation of a mixtape, Slow Wine Mixtape, with producer Pablo Martínez. The mixtape was released on November 11, 2016. It received generally favourable critics thanks to its innovative sound. Mondo Sonoro stated: "with this project Bad Gyal stands out from the disruptive base rag to embrace what she always considered her musical origins: Jamaican music. Much closer to Kingston than to Atlanta, Farelo has easily slipped through the music of his fellow generations and added "pegones beats". Bad Gyal started to raise online. Through that era, she hit a page on several professional music magazines and websites including Pitchfork and Fact Magazine, who named her song, "Jacaranda" their number 1 single of 2017. After releasing the mixtape's debut single "Fiebre", the singer started to grow exponentially in the areas of El Maresme, Barcelona and other points of Spain. Throughout the years, the song has developed a cult following and has been catalogued as a must play at clubs and music festivals. As "Fiebre" was having a lot of success, she was offered many record deals, which she turned down after some legal advises by lawyers and her dream to continue as an independent artist. The success of the mixtape and its critical acclaim led Farelo to perform at several festivals in Iceland and Japan, as well as the Red Bull Music Academy Festival in Los Angeles, and Sónar in Barcelona. In late 2017 she also toured Mexico and the US.
In February 2018, she released her second mixtape to critical acclaim, which she titled Worldwide Angel. The album was licensed and distributed with Canada Editorial. The mixtape was produced by Jam City, Dubbel Dutch, DJ Florentino and Spanish musician El Guincho. It spawned many singles including "Blink", "Candela" and "Internationally". The last one was included in the digital soundtrack of the first season of the Netflix teen drama series Élite and was featured in an episode. To promote the album, she took part of international festivals such as SXSW and Lollapalooza and toured once again the United States. During winter season she embarked on her first Asian tour, which visited countries like Japan, China or the Philippines. She also released "Open the Door" featuring Jamaican singer Govana, "Yo SIgo Iual" and "Unknown Feeling".


=== 2019–2021: Commercial breakthrough and Warm Up ===
Formerly signed with the production company Canada Editorial, in April 2019 it was announced Farelo had signed with Interscope Records and Aftercluv. The next month she was featured in Spanish Vogue. As a signed artist, Farelo moved to a more mainstream field with her first release being the long-anticipated "Santa María" featuring Busy Signal. It was released in parallel with "Milionària" by Rosalía, in which some called "the biggest musical weekend celebration in recent Catalan music memory". It marked Farelo's first charting song in Spain. It was later certified gold. A couple weeks later she released its B-side track, "Hookah", which also entered the charts, peaking at 55 in Spain. During the summer she embarked on her third solo tour Bad Gyal Soundsystem, which visited many festivals including Sónar, Jameson Urban Routes, Hellow, Arenal Sound and Ceremonia, among others. In October 2019 Farelo collaborated with Omar Montes on "Alocao", which eventually became huge in Spain and selected parts of Latin America. The song peaked number one in Spain for several weeks and was certified six times platinum for selling over 240,000 copies. Two months later, she released her biggest commercial solo track to date "Zorra", which peaked at number two on the PROMUSICAE chart and was certified platinum in Spain. Bad Gyal offered two major solo sold-out concerts at Razzmatazz and another sold-out one at La Riviera. The Soundsystem show was expected to begin a major Spanish and Latin American leg starting March 8, 2020, but could only do three shows due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Appearances at festivals like Estéreo Picnic and Primavera Sound were cancelled while the whole tour was postponed to 2021.
During the pandemic, Farelo was featured on Kafu Banton's "Tu Eres Un Bom Bom", which would later be remixed in collaboration with Guaynaa. She also released "Aprendiendo el Sexo" later on, with a music video produced by Canada and filmed at the luxurious W Hotel Barcelona. In November, she paired with Juanka and released "Blin Blin" to commercial success and the acclaim of the general public.

The EP peaked at 5 on the PROMUSICAE chart. She also collaborated with clothing brand Bershka and released an exclusive clothing line. On June 25, she collaborated with Mariah Angeliq and María Becerra on "Bobo", which sampled TLC's "No Scrubs" and sparked controversy due to similarity with Luchy DR's "Bufón". As tour season came to an end, Farelo published "Flow 2000" as well as the three-side single Soundsystem: the Final Releases featuring songs she had been performing live for years yet remained unreleased. She parallelly released "A La Mía" exclusively for the Grand Theft Auto Online radio station "Motomami Los Santos" hosted by Rosalía and Arca.
