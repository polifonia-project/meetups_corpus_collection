Thomas Jefferson (June 20, 1920 â€“ December 13, 1986) was an American Dixieland jazz trumpeter, strongly influenced by Louis Armstrong.


== Life and career ==
Jefferson was born in Chicago, Illinois in June 1920. He played drums and French horn while young before switching to trumpet. Jefferson professional career began when he was 14, and played with Billie and De De Pierce. He played with Papa Celestin's orchestra in 1936, as well as with New Orleans jazz musicians such as Sidney Desvigne and Armand "Jump" Jackson. In the 1950s, he worked with Johnny St. Cyr, Santo Pecora, and George Lewis. In 1966, Andrew Morgan recruited Jefferson to play lead trumpet for the Young Tuxedo Brass Band. Subsequently, Jefferson led a jazz band which performed at the New Orleans jazz club Maison Bourbon.Jefferson recorded sparingly as a leader; sessions include dates for Southland Records in the 1960s and Maison Bourbon Records in the 1970s. Jazz critic Scott Yanow called Jefferson "one of the finest trumpeters in New Orleans during the 1950s and 60s." Jefferson had a cameo as a jazz musician in the film Hard Times (1975). He died in New Orleans, Louisiana in December 1986 aged 66.
