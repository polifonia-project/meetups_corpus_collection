== Early life ==
Originally from Everett, Washington, Lambert attended Mariner High School between 2003 and 2007. Her mother is also a recording artist.She was raised as a Pentecostal Christian, but her family was expelled from the church when she was six years old because her mother had come out as a lesbian. Lambert later became an Evangelical Christian, attending Mars Hill Church beginning when she was in high school. She struggled for many years to reconcile her Christianity and her sexuality, even after coming out as a lesbian at the age of 17. She eventually concluded that being gay does not conflict with Christianity and that condemnation of gay people is antithetical to the Christian message.Lambert was sexually abused by her father and others as a child, and she has described herself as "ending up being a depressed eight-year-old". Lambert taught herself how to play piano and write songs at age 6 as an escape from her traumatic and abusive household. Lambert's poetry and music often discuss her early childhood traumas, sexual abuse, body image, bipolar disorder, and her sexuality. Lambert lives in Seattle, WA.Lambert moved to Seattle in 2007 where she studied at Cornish College of the Arts and graduated with a Bachelor of Music in Composition.
