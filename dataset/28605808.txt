== Life and career ==
Samuel Julian Lay was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on March 20, 1935. He began his career in 1957, as the drummer for the Original Thunderbirds. He soon after became the drummer for the harmonica player Little Walter.In 1960, he became the regular drummer for Muddy Waters, and remained in Waters's band until 1966.  In that time he also began recording and performing with prominent blues musicians, including Willie Dixon, Howlin' Wolf, Eddie Taylor, John Lee Hooker, Junior Wells, Bo Diddley, Magic Sam, Jimmy Rogers, and  Earl Hooker. The recordings Lay made during this time, along with Waters's album Fathers and Sons, recorded in 1969, are considered to be among the definitive works of Waters and Wolf.In 1966, Lay joined the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and recorded and toured extensively with them. Bob Dylan used Lay as his drummer when he introduced electric rock at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. Lay also recorded on Dylan's track "Highway 61 Revisited", and may have provided the siren whistle Dylan famously uses on the track.Lay's drumming can be heard on over 40 recordings for Chess Records, with many notable blues performers.
