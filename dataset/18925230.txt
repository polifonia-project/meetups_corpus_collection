In 2004, Chamillionaire called out the rest of the Houston hip hop scene because he felt like they weren't representing the best of what Houston had to offer, lyrically, and urged them to improve in order to gain the recognition he believes Houston deserves. In response, Swishahouse took offense and replied by criticizing Chamillionaire. Chamillionaire then accused Jones, a past member of Swishahouse, of slander. As a result, the first CD of The Mixtape Messiah included insults directed at Jones, including the tracks "You Got Wrecked", "Who They Want", and "Game Over".

He said, live on stage, "From the bottom of my heart, I apologize to Mike Jones for the triple disc Mixtape Messiah 1 diss tracks. I mean no disrespect."
