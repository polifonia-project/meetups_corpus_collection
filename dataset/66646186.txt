== Life and career ==
Cyn was born on May 13, 1993 in Michigan. By the age of 16 she was recording her own vocals and then doubling over it. After failing to get into DePaul University's music program, she graduated from the university in Management Information Systems.She found a mentor in Katy Perry and went on to be signed by her record label. The song that had made Perry and her team take note of her was Only With You, which she had written only two months back in September 2015. It would be another two years before Only With You was released as a single. Her debut single under Unsub was Together released in July 2017. She also opened for Perry's Witness: The Tour on the Mexico dates.
Her debut album "Mood Swing" released in September 2019. The seven track album includes production by Lars Stalfors and Matias Mora. Cyn describes the album as a "Parisian park" and that most of the songs in that album, including lyrics and melody, are built around a single sentence, the "thesis statement". Following this, Cyn then came out with a reimagined version of her debut album titled "Mood Swing (even moodier)" in September 2020. Her singles Drinks and Uh-Oh were written and recorded for the film Promising Young Woman. The single Moment of Truth was part of the animated film Smallfoot. Her latest single New York came out in October 2020.Her single Lonely Gun was part of the Birds of Prey soundtrack, while I Can't Believe was part of the soundtrack of To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You.On February 17, 2021, a son, Etienne Noel Newman, was born to Cyn and director and author Kyle Newman.
In August 2021, Cyn recorded a cover version of Sixpence None the Richer's "Kiss Me" for the Netflix film soundtrack of He's All That (2021).


== Artistry and influences ==
One of the earliest influences Cyn remembers is listening to her mother playing "Foolish Games" by Jewel when she was three or four. Her grandmother would listen to Doris Day. Having been born in Detroit, Motown inspired her a lot. Sheryl Crow and Rosalita are some of her favorites. Lorde's influence made her realize that she could create an entirely new persona to go along with her stage name. A new phase of inspiration came from Disney classics such as Sleeping Beauty.
