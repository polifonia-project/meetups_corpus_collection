Kellylee Evans (born 7 February 1975) is a Canadian jazz and soul music vocalist.


== Early life ==
Educated at Carleton University (1993–2000), it was there that Evans discovered jazz when she "got lost in the elevators of the Loeb Building and found the Music department on the ninth floor of the A tower." She went on to spend seven years there and earned two BAs in Law and English before starting on her MA in Law in 1997. Those studies were put on hold as she focused on her music career. She later returned to Carleton as the university's Artist-in-Residence.


== Career ==
In 2004 Evans won second place at the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Vocals Competition, where Quincy Jones, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Al Jarreau were among the judges. In 2006, she released her debut album Fight or Flight? for which was nominated for a 2007 Juno award.
Her Juno award-winning album Nina was inspired by the life and work of Nina Simone and was recorded after the French record label Plus Loin Music, who invited her to spend two days in their recording studio to record whatever she wanted. The record was released the same year as her album The Good Girl, all while homeschooling her three children under ten years of age On tours she has opened for George Benson, Tony Bennett, Chris Botti, Dianne Reeves, Maceo Parker, Derek Trucks and Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings. Notable live appearances have included the Sunfest, the Algoma Fall Festival with Michael Kaeshammer, and in 2012 she will debut at Toronto's Massey Hall, and the Imperial Theatre.
In 2013, Evans was struck by lightning while inside her home. Her career was initially on hiatus as a result, and in 2015 her friend Amanda Martinez launched a successful crowdfunding campaign to help Evans with living and health expenses. In November 2015, Evans then fainted while getting out of the bath, causing a head injury followed by post-concussion syndrome. As a result of breathing difficulties and dizziness she was unable to sing. However, eventually Evans returned to singing in 2018 and that year was nominated for the JUNO Award for Vocal Jazz Album of the Year for her album Come On. The album was recorded in Belgium, and explores the different stages of a relationship.She returned for her first concert in France on 16 May 2019 for the Jazz Festival à Saint-Germain-dès-près, with two other concerts in France in October 2019 and, finally, a concert tour throughout France from 6 March 2020 through 30 April 2020.
