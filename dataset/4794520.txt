Paul Colman is a British-Australian pop-rock guitarist, vocalist, pianist, and composer. He has made a name for himself as a Christian musician independently, with his band the Paul Colman Trio, as a solo artist, and as part of the Newsboys. His songwriting abilities have been acknowledged with a Grammy nomination and Dove Awards.

Colman was born and brought up in London; his father is Australian and his mother is British. When he was seven years old, his father left his successful life of theatre and music for a life of ministry back in Australia. His father was a long-standing Associate Pastor at Melbourne's Crossway Baptist Church and a well known gospel singer. Colman thus began his musical career living in Melbourne, starting his first band when he was eleven years old. During the first part of his life Colman did not take music too seriously, and focused on his career as a high-school teacher of history, English, and religion.
He has made a name for himself as a Christian musician independently, with his band the Paul Colman Trio, as a solo artist, and with the Newsboys. His songwriting abilities have been acknowledged with a Grammy nomination and Dove Awards.
