After, doctors discussed pros and cons of surgery with his daughter, who had medical power of attorney. Her choices were: (1) not operate and see if the aneurysm could be shrunk by medication, but if it bursts, it could cause paralysis; or (2) go ahead and do the surgery which could go well and he could recover or it could go the other way and he would be paralyzed. Due to his suicide attempt, which ended up causing the aneurysm, it was a hard choice for his daughter to make. She opted for the surgery and he ended up paralyzed. This caused him to have to be cared for in a nursing home for almost 12 years before he died of liver and pancreatic cancer on Wednesday, June 5, 2013, at the age of 75. He was survived by his two children, Jackie and Casey Bowman.
