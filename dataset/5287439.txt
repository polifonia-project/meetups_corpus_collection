They played mostly at parties and saw numerous bassists and guitarists come and go.  In 1987, with the addition of Chan Kinchla on guitar and Bobby Sheehan on bass, they renamed themselves "Blues Traveler".
After graduating from Princeton High School, Brendan (along with John and Bobby) enrolled in The New School for Social Research to study music.
Hill currently lives on Bainbridge Island, Washington, and owns a retail marijuana store on the island named Paper and Leaf.Hill uses Pearl drums and Zildjian cymbals.
