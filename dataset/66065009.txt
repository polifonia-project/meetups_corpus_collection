As a solo dancer for the Dunham Company, Strozier toured as far as South America and Europe. After their marriage, she moved to France in 1949. There she began to perform as a singer from 1952, also with greats like Sidney Bechet and Nat King Cole. In addition, she founded a dance school there, as in the 1960s in Zurich, where she taught Margrit Läubli, Daniel Spoerri, Ruedi Walter and Margrit Rainer. Duke Ellington wrote two songs for her; The singer's first recordings were made in 1967 with Mac Strittmatter's septet. Further albums were made from the 1980s.
