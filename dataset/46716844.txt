Alex Vlastaras (Greek: Άλεξ Βλαστάρας; born 8 November 1991), commonly known by his stage name Aero Chord, is a Greek electronic trap producer. He is mostly known for his songs within the trap genre, but has also delved into other music genres.


== History ==
Aero Chord began his career in 2011. In his interview in 2013 with Your EDM, Vlastaras spoke on the origins of the name Aero Chord, stating "Well, my name wasn't something easy to decide on. It took me at least 2 months of looking through name generators and combining their outputs endlessly until something good and meaningful and unique came up. When I saw Aero Chord it just clicked I guess. I started producing at the age of 14 I think, inspired by a cousin of mine who was making Goa and psy-trance back then and who helped me through my first steps with Reason. I've never DJ'ed much in my life before Aero Chord, I just knew I have to go through productions first to gain some recognition so I saw no point in it."Since he began his musical career, Vlastaras has signed with Monstercat and has released numerous songs under the label.


== Career ==
Vlastaras has released his music on Monstercat, High Intensity, Trap and Bass and other record labels. His tracks are commonly played on festivals by other popular artists in the electronic music scene, such as Diplo, Skrillex, DJ Snake and RL Grime.Having performed in festivals including Spring Awakening and Carnival of Bass, he started his first North America tour in June 2015.
Vlastaras' track "Surface" was popularized by YouTube introduction video templates, entertainment videos by various YouTube personalities and the Need for Speed gameplay demo at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015, gaining over 50 million views on YouTube as of 30 July 2018. Other tracks including "Ctrl Alt Destruction", "Boundless" and "Break Them" are also frequently used in various YouTube videos.
In 2020, he was dropped by Monstercat after MYLK posted an accusation of sexual assault by Aero Chord on her social media account.
