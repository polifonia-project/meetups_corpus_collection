== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Battistelli was born on May 18, 1985, in New York City. She grew up in a musical family with both of her parents involved in musical theater. "There was just something about live theater—especially musical theater—that has always resonated with me", she said. She "knew that she was going to spend her life performing" after seeing a performance of the musical The Secret Garden on Broadway at the age of six. "So I thought that was it. I was going to be Mary Lennox in The Secret Garden."When she was 15, she became a member of the Orlando, Florida all-girl mainstream pop group Bella. The group's touring performances included singing and dancing, which were "two things I loved", she said. After the group disbanded, Battistelli picked up the guitar and began writing songs.
