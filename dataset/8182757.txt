== Controversy ==
In January 2017, media outlets reported that Michele would perform at the inauguration of Donald Trump. This was met with backlash on social media, prompting Michele to respond via an open letter on Twitter, stating that she had intended her performance to serve as a bridge between Trump supporters and opponents. Author Aliya S. King published a response to the singer's letter on BET, expressing disappointment with Michele's choice to perform and felt like her letter was a "cop-out". Michele was initially supposed to perform at the Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration held the day prior to the inauguration, but did not perform and instead played at one of the inaugural balls the following day. In response to her performing, Spike Lee removed Michele's song "Black Girl Magic" from his upcoming Netflix series She's Gotta Have It. Subsequent to the performance, Michele announced the release of her poetry album No Political Genius.
