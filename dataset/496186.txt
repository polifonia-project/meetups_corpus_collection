Chitose Hajime (元 ちとせ, Hajime Chitose, born January 5, 1979) is a Japanese singer from Amami Ōshima. She sings in the shima-uta style particular to that region, with distinctive falsetto effects.


== History ==


=== Early life ===
Chitose Hajime began learning shamisen under her mother's encouragement from a young age. At age 10 she began to pick up shima-uta, a style of singing passed down through generations.She won many folk and other song competitions during her teens, traveling to events across Japan. She released two traditional folk albums on cassette on an indie label, the first at age 16, and at age 17 was approached by numerous record labels following a grand prize win at a local folk song contest. Stating in a later interview that she was "suspicious of them", she decided not to join the labels or pursue music, and instead chose to study to become a beautician, following in the footsteps of her older sister. She moved to Osaka in 1997. However, she suffered from asthma and had severe allergic reactions to many of the chemicals used by beauticians. She withdrew from school, but before returning home to Amami Ōshima she contacted the artist management company Office Augusta, the only company that had gone all the way to visit her on her home island during the flurry to sign her at age 17.


=== Music career ===
In March 2001, she released a self-titled mini-album through Augusta Records. The album of cover versions included four English-language songs performed originally by Carole King, The Sugarcubes, Jimi Hendrix and Velvet Underground, but was so well received that Hajime was pushed to release another mini-album less than five months later. In August 2001, Chitose released her second mini-album with Augusta Records entitled Kotonoha (コトノハ), this time featuring five original tracks.
In 2002, she released her first major label single on Epic Records – Wadatsumi no Ki (ワダツミの木) ("The Sea-God's Tree"). It was the third highest selling single of the year behind only Hikaru Utada's "traveling", and Ayumi Hamasaki's "H", selling an estimated 850,000 copies. Three months later, she released a brand new single, "Kimi o Omou" (君ヲ想フ). While also very popular, it was not nearly the success that her first single was, although it did help to cement her as a permanent artist.
Her first major album, Hainumikaze (ハイヌミカゼ), followed later in the year. It sold 800,000 copies, charted for 57 weeks, and was the 16th highest selling album of the year.
She released three more singles before her second major album, Nomad Soul (ノマド・ソウル, nomado souru), was released in 2003. Shortly after a concert tour, and the release of a live album and DVD in 2004, Hajime announced that she would be getting married, and was to have her first child in 2005.
She returned to the music industry in November 2005 with the single "Kataritsugu Koto" (語り継ぐこと), the ending theme for the anime series BLOOD+. The single was a hit, reaching No. 12 on the Oricon charts. She followed this success with "Haru no Katami" (春のかたみ), the ending theme for the anime AYAKASHI – Japanese Classic Horror. The single sold 6,050 copies in its first week, and remained on the charts for seven weeks total. A third single, "Ao no Requiem" (青のレクイエ), was the theme song for the Studio GAGA film Hatsukoi. The following week, Hajime released her third original major album, Hanadairo (ハナダイロ). A limited edition version featured a 13th track, "Shinda Onna no Ko" (死んだ女の子) with Ryuichi Sakamoto), as well as a DVD containing the music videos for "Kataritsugu Koto", and "Haru no Katami".
Following Hanadairo (ハナダイロ), Hajime took an extended break to spend time with her family and moving to Okinawa. She returned in 2008 with the release of "CASSINI" (カッシーニ), based on the theme of family and bonding.In August 2010 she released two albums simultaneously, the Japanese language "Orient" and the English language "Occident".


== Influence ==
Studies have revealed that her particular style of singing, including aspects of traditional Amami-Ōshima music, has a relaxing effect that has been observed in electroencephalograms taken from the brains of people listening to her singing.
