== Music career ==
He played with Franco and TPOK Jazz, which he joined in 1968. He later joined the band Lovy du Zaire, formed in 1971 or 1972 by Victor "Vicky" Longomba, who was previously a co-founder of OK Jazz and afterward a member of African Jazz.  Other later-famous musicians in Lovy du Zaire included Bumba Massa, Youlou Mabiala and Syran Mbenza. According to one source, however, he "could not tolerate the leader's hypocrisy and soon quit."In 1974, he traveled from Zaire to East Africa, first settling in Tanzania for several years. In the late 1970s, he formed a new version of his band Somo Somo, roughly translated  Double Trouble, performing in the Lingala language. The band performed in Tanzania, Zambia and Kenya. In the early 1980s he moved to Kenya, where he re-formed Somo Somo and recorded several albums. In 1983 "Fan Fan" arrived in London, England mixing his music with English jazz musicians.In the 1990s he joined Bana OK, a tribute band to the late Franco Luambo Makiadi of TPOK Jazz. By 2000 until now "Fan Fan" has returned to the roots of the Acoustic Rumba style. As of the early 2010s, he was resident in London and had acquired British citizenship by the time of his death.
