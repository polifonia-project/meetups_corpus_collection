D'Gary (Ernest Randrianasolo born 22 July 1961) is a Malagasy musician of Bara ethnicity. His primary instrument is the acoustic guitar.


== Musical style ==
D'Gary's elaborate playing style is characterised by his use of alternative tunings. His style developed from his interest in Malagasy music such as tsapiky popular in southern Madagascar and has been compared to the music produced on traditional instruments like the Vezo's marovany frame box zither and the Bara's lokanga violin.
In 2007, he toured through North America with the International Guitar Night ensemble and recorded the International Guitar Night II live album with the collaboration of Brian Gore (US), Miguel de la Bastide (Trinidad) and Clive Carroll (UK) under the Pacific Music label.
In April 2009, he toured the United States as part of the Throw Down Your Heart tour with Bela Fleck and other African musicians.
