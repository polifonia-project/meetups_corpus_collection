Greta Simone Kline (born March 21, 1994), formerly known by the stage name Frankie Cosmos, is an American musician and singer-songwriter. She is known for her independent releases, inspired by Frank O'Hara's poetry, DIY ethics of K Records and the early 2000s New York City's anti-folk scene. She is the daughter of actors Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates. Her former stage name "Frankie Cosmos" is now the name of her band.


== Early life ==
Greta Kline was born in New York City, the daughter of Academy Award-winning actor Kevin Kline and actress Phoebe Cates. Her father is of German-Jewish and Irish descent and her mother has Russian-Jewish and Chinese-Filipino ancestry. She has one older brother, Owen Kline.
Kline was introduced to music by her family. She settled on guitar as her primary instrument of choice at seventh grade, after playing the piano and briefly the drums. Home-schooled for most of high school, she spent time by attending underground rock shows in New York and getting involved in the Westchester music scene. Kline  attended New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study for two years, and studied English and/or poetry. Kline found the school to be unaccommodating of her touring schedule, and dropped out.Kline and her brother Owen both appeared in the films The Anniversary Party (2001) and The Squid and the Whale (2005).
