== Career ==
José Antonio Bravo was born in Arica, a city in the extreme northern region of Arica y Parinacota Region of Chile in 1975. Bitman moved to Santiago in the 1990s to study and then work as a designer. There he met architect Christian Powditch, with whom he began to explore music composition with very simple software. The duo eventually acquired the name “Bitman & Roban” (a play on Batman & Robin). The sound of their first album “Hurtos” (“Robberies”, 2000) was very close to Hip Hop. On their second album, “Robar es natural” (“Stealing is natural”, 2002), the duo included real voices and instruments, changing the previous purely digitally constructed sound.
In 2003, DJ Bitman released his first solo album, “Sunset beats” (2003) with the collaboration of jazz bassist Roberto Titae Lindl (Los Tres) and members of Tiro de Gracia and Los Tetas.
“Música para después de almuerzo” (“Music for after lunch”, 2005) was his third album with Bitman & Roban, this time as a whole band instead of a duo.
In 2006, he collaborated as a producer in the album “Quintana Roo” (R-H), a side project, and in 2007 released “Latin Bitman”, a mix of electronic bases and acoustic instruments such as (Double bass, Marimba, Guitar, Piano and Hammond organ). This produced an exotic sound that resembles jazz, bossa nova, funk, chachachá and mambo. In live performances, Latin Bitman is supported by an orchestra.
“Colour” (2009) repeated the technique of including different elements and takes this even further. It also included Bitman’s first collaboration with Francisca Valenzuela on the track "Help me”.
In 2011, Bitman teamed up with Eric Bobo of Cypress Hill to form the group Ritmo Machine, which released the album "Welcome To The Ritmo Machine" in November 2011.
Since 2011, he has collaborated on the soundtracks of several international films, including Aftershock (2012),   Crystal Fairy & the Magical Cactus (2012), From Prada to Nada (2011).
