== Career ==

Endresen was one of the most pronounced female jazz musicians in Norway in the beginning of the 21st century. She is a versatile artist, who likes to challenge her voice with new experimental forms and combination of jazz and other artistic expressions. Her work has moved from "fusion" and "chamber jazz" in the 1980s and 1990s, to improvisational "new" musical forms in the mid 1990s until today. She has also moved from larger formats to explore solo, duo and trio formats. The last 15 years have her work mainly been concentrated on the genre of free improvisation music, both as a performer and as composer.Endresen studied English and Anthropology and stayed in the UK back in 1976, before settling in Oslo, where she started her artistic career.She worked as a singer, composer and songwriter with soul group «Chipahua» (1979- ), with Jon Eberson Group (1980–87). With Eberson, she made a series of musically strong albums at the interface between jazz and rock that was highly popular and acclaimed by a growing audience. The result of this cooperation was five celebrated CDs, awarded two times the Spellemannprisen.Endresen and Westerhus is followed by new experimental Norwegian musicians like Natalie Sandtorv and Torgeir Standal in The Jist duo.
