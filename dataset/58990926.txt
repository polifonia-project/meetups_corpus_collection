== Career ==
Their debut album, Silver Dollar Moment, was released in February 2018 on Heavenly Records. AllMusic described the album as a "stunning debut... it does have a uniquely sweet spirit and lighthearted beauty all its own by a young U.K. trio that gives the baggy indie dance sound of the early '90s a serious upgrade."Their second album, Disco Volador, was released in February 2020 on Heavenly Records. It was produced by Marta Sologni. The Guardian gave it a three out of five stars rating, describing the album as the band "expanding the sound of their winsome but somewhat conventional debut by abandoning traditional song structures and voyaging into new textures." It has a Metacritic rating of 73, with critics commenting that the album mixes "the euphoria of whooshing through infinite space past astral displays of imagined beauty via a blend of disco funk, dream pop, electronic exotica and '70s highlife" (Uncut) and Q saying that the album is "both instantly appealing and dazzling inventive."
