Daniel Berkowitz of website The Spit Take called Sheen "a hilarious and gifted performer" with "a unique voice that heâ€™s able to expertly harness." Drew Hunt of the Chicago Reader noted that Sheen's comedy can be "highly personal or emotionally transparent" and compared him to Brian Posehn for his "delivery and lucid, streetwise worldview."
