== Early life ==
Vaidya was born and raised in Kathmandu, Nepal. He was introduced to music by his family and credits his style, influences and musical development to his family: “My story with music began with my family. My mother taught me how to sing, my father taught us to listen to music in all its forms and my brother taught me to evolve with music. So any style or influence I have is constituted by parts of what I learned from my family. My continuity in music comes from the sheer love I have for it.”Vaidya's early influences include various genres with artists such as The Eagles, UB40, Linkin Park and Karna Das among others. He started performing live during his school days and later began publishing his work through Facebook.


== Career ==
Vaidya's first major release was "Aaja Matra" (2014). His next single, "Hawaijahaj" (2016) was a breakthrough. The music video for the song was produced by Fuzz Factory Productions. He later (re)released "Mooskaan" (2018) and "Anountho Mutu" (2018). On 1 January 2019, Sajjan released a single titled "Hataarindai, Bataasindai". The screenplay features a straight couple and a gay couple, and the video depicts a gay couple kissing, which is uncommon in Nepali media. Vaidya is one of the very few Nepali artists to represent the LGBTQ community through the video's release.
"When I wrote Hataarindai, Bataasindai, it was independent of the video concept. We decided that the under representation of the LGBTQ community in Nepal was an important issue that needed to be addressed and that is how the video came about." The 2019 single has been adopted by the LGBTIQ community of Nepal as an anthem, featuring the song during the first pride parade of Nepal that took place in July 2019.


== Katha ==
Katha is a video series started by Vaidya in 2018. The series debuted in the artist's YouTube channel. The video series features a live, acoustic rendition of a song published by the artist or other artists, and also includes a section discussing the origin and the composition process of the song.
