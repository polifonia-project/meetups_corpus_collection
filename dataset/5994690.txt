Maj Lillemor "Lill" Lindfors (born 12 May 1940) is a Finnish-Swedish singer who has performed in Scandinavia since the 1960s.


== Career ==
She was born in Helsinki, Finland, and made her debut as a revue actress in Uddevalla in 1960. The following year she made her first recording. In the most recent decades, Lindfors has been known in Scandinavia for her "one-woman shows" in which she mixes music with a lot of comedy. She was one of the first artists who sang samba in Sweden, and she was also one of the first Swedish performers who did stand-up comedy in her shows.

Eurovision Song ContestLindfors's performance of "Nygammal Vals" ("New, yet familiar waltz")  with Svante Thuresson took second place in the 1966 Eurovision Song Contest.
She was a presenter at the  1985 Eurovision Song Contest in Gothenburg, Sweden, and was most famous for having a wardrobe malfunction live, during the contest, after passing through a part of the elaborate set. She later admitted it was a gag, but that it had not been rehearsed beforehand. The EBU was reportedly not pleased with the stunt. It remains one of the most iconic moments in the contest's history. She also performed "Musik ska byggas utav glädje" ("My Joy Is Building Bricks of Music") as the contest's major opener.

OthersShe has starred in several Swedish TV shows which have won awards in Montreux.
In 1998, she became Sweden's Goodwill Ambassador to UNICEF.
