== Career ==
While he was studying in Chile, in 1973, Zúñiga recorded his first 45 rpm single with "Producciones Caracol", including as one side the David Gates' song "Everything I Own".
At 17, during his first year of law school, he composed his first song, "Ventanillas" ("Little Windows"). In February 1974, he performed in the XV Festival Internacional de la Canción de Viña del Mar.
In October of that year, he obtained seventh place in the third edition of the OTI Festival, celebrated in Acapulco, Mexico, singing the song "Gaviota" ("Seagull"), which meant the first participation of Nicaragua in this Festival.
The same year, he recorded his first album: "Del arco iris, una canción" ("A Song from the Rainbow").
In 1977 Zúñiga took part in XVIII Festival Internacional de la Canción de Viña del Mar, obtaining second place for Nicaragua with the song "Cancionero" ("Song Book").
In 1978 Zúñiga released Cancionero (Song Book), professionally starting his musical career. The production was directed by Juan Carlos Calderón.
Between December 1979 and January 1980, Zúñiga recorded a new work by the hand of the Spanish singer-songwriter Manuel Alejandro. The songs included "Procuro olvidarte" ("Trying to forget you"), "Ven con el alma desnuda" ("Come as you are"), "Un pasajero" ("A Passenger"), "Insoportablemente bella" ("Unbearably Beautiful") or "Ese beso que me has dado" ("That Kiss that You Have Given Me").
In 1982 Zúñiga recorded the album A tanto fuego (On So Much Fire) in London, Germany and Madrid.
In 1986, he released "¿Cómo te va mi amor?" ("How is it going, baby?"). Manuel Mijares also turns into success the Hernaldo's composition "Siempre" (Always). Angela Carrasco, Jeannette, Sergio and Estíbaliz and Yuri (Mexican singer) between others, endorses success of his compositions.
At this time Zúñiga took a sabbatical, and broke ties with the Zafiro record label.
Two years later, already residing in Mexico, he released the album Qué increíble es la distancia (Distance is so incredible), which included the songs "Mira arriba" ("Look Up"), "Una vez al mes" ("Once A Month"), "Tengo unos celos que matan" ("I feel so terribly jealous", "Te llevaré" ("I Will Take You with Me").

As of 1992, Zúñiga produces, prepares arrangements and composed "Después de todos estos años" (After All These Years).
In London and with the help of Chucho Merchán, he records "No tengo más patria que tu corazón" ("I Have no more Homeland than your Heart"), "¿Adónde?" ("Where?"), "Al otro lado del mundo" ("At the Other Side of the World") and "Eres todo menos azar" ("You are Everything but chance").
Zúñiga signed an exclusive contract with Universal Music Mexico. "Triángulo de musgo" ("Moss Triangle") is the title of the album that initiates his journey in his new record house. The production, arrangements and the songs were Zúñiga's responsibility; the album was recorded in London, Madrid and Los Angeles.
His production "Nómada" ("Nomad") was released in May 2007.
Zúñiga has his own record label, Zungu Music.
