=== Early years ===
Harnell started singing at the age of 5. At 17 he joined his first band and spent the next three years in approximately fifteen bands including Bronx-based Jackals, a band of cultivated talent emerging from the guitarist's home basement that in a scant two years, gained enough popularity in the NYC area to fill rock clubs to capacity simply by word of mouth alone. This was the band in which Harnell was discovered.   At 18, Harnell started studying with vocal teacher Don Lawrence.


=== TNT ===
After a show in 1984, Harnell was introduced to record producer Mike Varney who mentioned a band in Norway, TNT, that was looking for a singer. Harnell was hired shortly after the band heard a demo tape of his vocals.
Harnell and guitarist Ronni Le Tekrø co-wrote all of TNT's material together during Harnell's 22-year run with the band. With Harnell, TNT recorded nine studio albums, two live videos and two "best of" compilations.
He left the band in April 2006 for personal and professional reasons. He performed his last show with the band on June 30, 2006 and a DVD was released that autumn that features the penultimate show in Madrid, Spain on April 1.
On October 17, 2013, Harnell announced that he had rejoined TNT.After a year and a half absence, during which time, he fronted Skid Row, Harnell announced another return to TNT in May 2016.Harnell would leave the band once again in October 2017 and was replaced by previous unknown Baol Bardot Bulsara.

Following this in 2004, Harnell performed the Team Sonic theme for Sonic Heroes called "We Can", again with Poley and in 2011 he returned for Sonic Generations to perform two new remixes of "Escape from the City" with Poley.
