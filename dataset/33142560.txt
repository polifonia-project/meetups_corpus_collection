In an interview with Resident Advisor, Rostron stated: "Last summer after touring W, I had a bit of a creative meltdown and wasn't sure about making music any more—then I wrote 'Patriarchy Over And Out', and suddenly the goal of the next album became clear".

They also revealed that in the spring of 2012 they set up a studio space with Olof Dreijer (of The Knife), Hermione Frank (also known as rRoxymore), and Paula Temple.Rostron states that "Patriarchy Over And Out" was a turning point "which was the beginning of being more direct and experimenting with being more political".On 8 March 2013, Rostron released Misogyny Drop Dead EP and in mid-July released "Let's Talk About Gender Baby", a vinyl-only remix of "Full of Fire" by The Knife.On 29 October 2013, Rostron announced a third studio album All Love's Legal along with a music video for its opening track "Welcome".

Both were released via Human Level / DFA Records. Powerhouse includes several tracks in which Rostron sings about their family and childhood in Bolton, England. The title track is a tribute to Rostron's mother; Rostron has said, "She's basically the powerhouse of the record. It was the hardest track to write, to pin down and express my love and adoration for my mum, because there's so many things that she's done for me, for the family, for my sister. She's the powerhouse, for sure."


== Artistry ==
Planningtorock has stated that the distortion of their vocals allows for the "playing around with gender alongside communicating what I feel is the emotions within the songs. Because I am really interested in expanding upon the limits that we live in – how we are defined – and it is an experiment".
