He was also the singing narrator in the Taco Bell "Run For the Border" television spots. Brown also found work as a songwriter for E.M.I. Publishing before signing to Capitol Records in 1984. He was with E.M.I. for 13 years. Brown's first release for the label, "Drowning in Memories", peaked at No.39 on the Billboard country charts. The title song of his debut album "I Tell It Like It Used To Be" went to No.7, followed by "I Wish That I Could Hurt That Way Again" to No.4, giving way to a pair of number ones, "Hell and High Water" and "Don't Go To Strangers".Brown's first release for the label, "Drowning in Memories", peaked at No. 39 and was never included on an album. After it came the No. 7 "I Tell It Like It Used to Be", the first single from his 1986 album of the same name. Counting its title track, this album accounted for four singles: the No. 3 "I Wish That I Could Hurt That Way Again" and two straight Number Ones in "Hell and High Water" and "Don't Go to Strangers".Brown's second album for the label, Brilliant Conversationalist, followed a year later. Although none of its singles went to Number One, it accounted for three more Top Ten hits in its title track, followed by "She Couldn't Love Me Anymore" and "Last Resort". A third album, 1988's Come as You Were, produced his third and final Number One in "Darlene". Then came the No. 7 title track and No. 30 "Never Say Never". In early 1990, he sang guest vocals on the multi-artist charity single "Tomorrow's World", as well as Tanya Tucker's single "Don't Go Out", from her album Tennessee Woman.
1990 also saw the release of his next album, Bumper to Bumper. This album's lead-off single "If You Could Only See Me Now" went Top Ten with a No. 6 peak, but the other singles — the No. 18 "Moonshadow Road" and No. 53 "I'm Sending One Up for You" — did not fare as well, with the latter being his first single to land outside the Top 40. That same year, he also released an unsuccessful greatest-hits package. His next album, You Can't Take It with You, only accounted for the No. 31 "With This Ring" before he exited Capitol in 1991.
Brown did not record another album until 1998's Wine into Water on the Intersound label. This album produced four more singles for him, although the No. 44 title track was the highest-charting single from it. The subject matter of the lyrics of the song surrounded Brown's then ongoing fight against alcoholism. He then released two more independent albums: The Next Right Thing in 2003 and The Present in 2006.
