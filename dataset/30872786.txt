== Acting career ==
An established celebrity among Japanese television, Takashi Fujii is most active as an actor and a comedic host.
In the western world, and particularly the United States, he is perhaps best known for his appearance as Matthew Minami, hosting his own show, with Bill Murray's character Bob Harris in the 2003 movie Lost in Translation. As Matthew, his trademark blonde wig and garish suits complement his effeminate but wacky personality.
Although Bill Murray has never been a guest, Fujii (as Matthew Minami) actually hosted such a program, now called Matthew's Best Hit UV, largely consisting of musicians and popular Japanese celebrities, the show's guests are often subject to fierce competition by Matthew Minami himself. The character Matthew Minami also appears in a handful of programs and shorts related to Best Hit TV.
Takashi Fujii is also a popular talent himself and appears frequently on many Japanese variety shows. He is considerably less flamboyant while appearing as himself, but his frequent seemingly random comments and odd gestures are all part of his signature performances. He has even made appearances in the US and China showing off both his comedy and music. Takashi Fujii is currently featured on the following programs (titles are loose translations):

発見!仰天!!プレミアもん!!! 土曜はダメよ! (Hakken! Gyōten!! Puremia mon!!! Doyō wa Dame yo!) on YTV
