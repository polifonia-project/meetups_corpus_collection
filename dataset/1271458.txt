Makihara was born on 18 May 1969 in Takatsuki, Osaka, Japan. He attended Aoyama Gakuin University to study English literature. In addition to creating songs for his own music career, he has written, produced and performed songs for many other artists, the most notable being SMAP's Sekai ni Hitotsu Dake no Hana. He is ranked at No.84, in a list of Japan's top 100 musicians, provided by HMV.He was also invited to write the song "The Gift" for English band blue in their album "Guilty".

(どんなときも), both of which, among several others, are covered to this day by current popular artists (including English-language covers by various American artists). Some of his music has been translated into other languages, and "Donna Toki mo", specifically has been remixed by Bemani artists "Dream Line Out" for use on Konami's Beatmania game series.
