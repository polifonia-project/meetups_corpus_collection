Bryant Clifford Meyer (sometimes credited as Clifford Meyer, BC Meyer, Cliff Meyer or Bryant C Meyer) is a keyboardist, guitarist and vocalist, best known for his tenure with Los Angeles, California-based post-metal band Isis. He was with the band since its debut full-length, Celestial, in 2000. Previously, he was a formative member of Boston-based rock band The Gersch. He is also a member of post-rock side projects Red Sparowes, Windmills by the Ocean and a solo project named Taiga.
In April 2012 it was announced that Meyer had joined Chino Moreno of Deftones, along with former bandmates Aaron Harris and Jeff Caxide, in a side project by the name of Palms. Their first album was originally slated for release in 2012, but eventually was put out by Ipecac Recordings in 2013.
