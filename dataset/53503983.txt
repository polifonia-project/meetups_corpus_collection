In 2019, following the Mnet vote manipulation investigation, Lee's father alleged through her fan site that CJ ENM suggested during her audition that she sign with their subsidiary agency to ensure that she would be able to debut after elimination, and she had done so out of fear of not being accepted into Idol School. However, after being eliminated, CJ ENM did not follow up and she was unable to sign contracts with other agencies. In response, CJ ENM issued an apology. Following the news, Lee revealed on Instagram and on PD Note the poor conditions she and other contestants worked under.
