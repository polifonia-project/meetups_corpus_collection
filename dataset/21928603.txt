Ulla Wiesner (born 12 December 1940, Werl/Westphalia) is a German singer.

Ulla Wiesner was active from 1963 to 2002 as a singer. In 1965, she represented Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest, with her song, "Paradies, wo bist du?" (Paradise, where are you?). It scored zero points along with three other countries out of the eighteen which entered in total. Past the Eurovision Song Contest, of which the zero point result has hurt her solo career before it even fully began, she was mainly active with the Botho-Lucas-Chorus, where she stayed as chorister as main profession for 30 years, notably for their musical accompaniment on the German TV show Musik ist Trumpf.Furthermore, there are several songs existing in the Brilliant-Musik archives, which was founded by Werner Tautz, who wrote several songs for Wiesner, together with Heinz Kiessling and Hans Gerig. Wiesner released an album called Twilight Mood in 1970 with Addy Flor and his Orchestra. As one of Germany's busiest studio singers, she was assigned as backing vocalist for many popular artists, including Triumvirat's album Illusions on a Double Dimple in 1974. Since then, notable singles of hers include titles such as "Abends kommen die Sterne" ("In the evening the stars appear"), "Wenn dieser Tag zu Ende geht" ("When this day comes to an end") and "Charade".
