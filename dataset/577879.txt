Of French parentage and born in Los Angeles, Lor moved with her mother to Jackson Heights, Queens, New York at the age of 5, following her father's death. She graduated Newtown High School and took art courses at night at Cooper Union, intent on becoming a commercial artist, while waitressing during the day at a Schrafft's restaurant. She also had a love for singing, saving up money to do it professionally. She believed her chance to sing in Sonja Henie's New York ice show at the Center Theatre to be her big break. She also decided to use her mother's maiden name, Lor, as her stage name.

== Recording ==
Lor's main hit song was "If I Give My Heart to You", which charted in 1954 at the same time as another recording of the same song by Doris Day.
