Mahieu de Gant (fl. mid–late 13th century) was a Flemish trouvère (poet-composer) from Ghent associated with the so-called "school of Arras". He has been conflated with Mahieu le Juif, but the same manuscript containing both their works clearly distinguishes them. His career can only be dated because of those with whom he composed jeux partis, which includes Robert de la Piere, who died in 1258. All of Mahieu's melodies are in bar form.
