== Work with The Enid ==
Francis Lickerish's skill as a musician is second only to his skill as a storyteller. A much awaited feature of concerts given by The Enid was his storytelling. He would sit, often cross-legged, on stage and narrate a long "shaggy dog" style story while the roadies changed instruments or re-arranged the stage for the next set. Having their roots in traditional tales, the stories were novel time-fillers which would captivate an audience of thousands and entertain them while otherwise boring technical work was going on. A favourite of Enid fans was the story of The Archangel Barry. This was the introduction to "Albion Fair" in which an angel exhorted the band to write music with "more notes in it".
His magnum opus however was the story of Fand. This ancient myth was amalgamated with the legends of King Arthur to create an epic and magical tale that was at once fresh and rooted in tradition.
