== Biography ==
Born Jonah Moore, his sister is Kassie Carlson, the vocalist for Guerilla Toss.
Jenkins formed Only Living Witness with Eric Stevenson, of Formicide in 1989.  The band performed in 14 countries including Sweden, England, France, Canada, Italy, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. When Only Living Witness split up in 1995, Jenkins went on to form two bands, Miltown and Milligram. Miltown was signed by Larry Jacobson to Irving Azoff's Giant Records, aka Revolution Records. Miltown recorded several demo tapes on their own with guitarist/producer Brian McTernan and guitarist Matt Squire, releasing a CDEP (Hydra Head Records) and two 7" vinyl records, and one album for Revolution Records, with producer Toby Wright which was never released, and the group subsequently split.
Jenkins then returned to work with Milligram, releasing two albums, Hello Motherfucker!, and This Is Class War on three different labels: Tortuga Recordings, Overcome Records, and Small Stone Records.
In 2001, Jenkins contributed lyrics and vocals for the song "Stockholm (Blues)" on 5ive's Continuum Research Project's album The Telestic Disfracture, also on Tortuga Recordings. In 2002, Jenkins formed Raw Radar War (formerly Septic Youth Command), and also started a record label, TRAKTOR7 Records, releasing albums by Milligram, Crash and Burn, Lamont, The Hidden, Waltham, Blacktail, Quintaine Americana, Morgan Knockers, and Black Helicopter. In 2005, Jenkins contributed vocals on two songs to Crash and Burn's album The Value of Mistrust.
In 2006, Jenkins sang on 36 Crazyfists's album, Rest Inside The Flames, on the track "We Cannot Deny". The same year he performed vocals on Converge's album, No Heroes for the track "Grim Heart/Black Rose". In 2008, Jenkins appeared as a guest vocalist on one track of Ehnahre's debut album, The Man Closing Up.
In 2008, Only Living Witness briefly reformed to perform four reunion shows. In 2011, Milligram reformed to play at Worcester Palladium with the Kyuss Lives! Tour in Worcester, Massachusetts.
In March 2017, Raw Radar War recorded with Glenn Smith for the Death Kiss Radio Show CD release, Volume One of a series.
On April 20, 2018, The Northern Skulls (with Jenkins on vocals) digitally released a single called "Eyes Are Why".
