Johanna Senfter ( 27 November 1879 â€“ 11 August 1961) was a German composer.
Johanna Senfter was born and died in Oppenheim.  From 1895 she studied composition under Iwan Knorr, violin under Adolf Rebner, piano under Karl Friedberg and organ at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt am Main. This gave her a considerable amount of musical training when in 1908 she became a student of Max Reger in Leipzig. She composed nine symphonies, 26 orchestral works and concertos for piano, violin, viola, and cello. Senfter was a masterful composer of fugue. Altogether she left behind 134 works.
