Before his professional music career began he was a professional boxer where he established a respectable 14-4 record. Boxing career highlights include winning the Mid-South Middleweight Championship in Memphis, Tennessee and culminated with a nationally televised bout with former world champion Roberto Dur√°n, After a few years of working in a Tupelo furniture factory and playing in local clubs he was discovered by music professional Miles Copeland (brother of The Police drummer Stewart Copeland).
In 1997, while performing at a singer-songwriters night at a local pizza shop (Vanelli's), Roger Sovine representing BMI overheard Thorn and was impressed with his singing and song writing ability. He asked Thorn if he had his permission to share his name with other record companies in Nashville. A couple weeks later, Thorn called vOz Vanelli (owner of Vanelli's) and mentioned that several record companies were coming to Tupelo to hear him perform. Thorn asked if he could come and play at Vanelli's which vOz agreed to. After hearing Thorn perform, Wyatt Easterling (an associate of Miles Copeland III) brought Thorn to Nashville and within thirty days, Thorn opened for Sting. Thorn was subsequently signed to a recording contract with A&M Records and recorded his first album, Hammer & Nail, in 1997.

"I wrote these songs hoping they might put people in a positive mindset and encourage them to count their own blessings, like I count mine," Thorn observes. "There's no higher goal I could set for myself than to help other people find some happiness and gratitude in their lives."In March 2018, Thorn released an album, titled Don't Let the Devil Ride, featuring several covers of gospel songs that were inspiration to him during his youth and adolescence.
