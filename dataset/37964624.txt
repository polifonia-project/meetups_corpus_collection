Donzella Petty-John, known professionally as Nella Dodds (born January 25, 1950) is an American soul singer and actress.  Born in Havre de Grace, Maryland, United States, she recorded six released singles for Wand Records between 1964 and 1966. Her records are popular on the Northern soul scene.

== "Come See About Me" ==
The Supremes, whilst being the first to record "Come See About Me", were not the first to issue it as a single. That distinction fell to Dodds, and her version started selling, climbing to #74 on the Billboard Hot 100, but Motown quickly released the Supremes' version as a single, which killed sales of Dodds's version.


== Compilation album - This is a Girl's Life ==
Although Dodds was scheduled to have a vinyl album released in the mid 1960s, it was never released. "This Is A Girl's Life" includes all 12 tracks released as singles plus an additional three that were not released at the time.  The tracks were recorded for Philadelphia's Dyno-Dynamic Productions (leased by New York's Wand label) between 1964 and 1966. The CD was released in 2007.
