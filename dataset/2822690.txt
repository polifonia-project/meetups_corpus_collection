Richard Filler Taruskin (born 2 April 1945) is an American musicologist and music critic who is among the leading and most prominent music historians of his generation. The breadth of his scrutiny into source material as well as musical analysis that combines sociological, cultural and political perspectives, has incited much discussion, debate and controversy. He has written on a wide variety of topics, but central to his research is Russian music of the 18th century to present day. Other subjects he engages with include the theory of performance, 15th-century music, 20th-century classical music, nationalism in music, the theory of modernism, and analysis. He is best known for his monumental survey of Western classical music, the 6 volume Oxford History of Western Music. In addition, he regularly writes music criticism for newspapers like The New York Times.


== Early life and education ==
Born on 2 April 1945 in New York, Taruskin was raised in a musical family; his mother was a piano teacher and father an amateur violinist. He attended the High School of Music & Art, where he studied cello. Taruskin received his B.A. magna cum laude (1965), M.A. (1968) and Ph.D. in historical musicology (1976) from Columbia University. As a choral conductor he directed the Columbia University Collegium Musicum. He played the viola da gamba with the Aulos Ensemble from the late 1970s to the late 1980s.


== Career ==
Taruskin's extensive 1996 study Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions: A Biography of the Works through Mavra shows that Igor Stravinsky drew more heavily on Russian folk material than has previously been recognized, and analyzes the historical trends that caused Stravinsky not to be forthcoming about some of these borrowings.Taruskin has also written extensively for lay readers, including numerous articles in The New York Times, many of which have been collected in Text and Act (in which he is an influential critic of the premises of the "historically informed performance" movement in classical music), The Danger of Music and Other Anti-Utopian Essays, and On Russian Music. His writings have frequently taken up social, cultural, and political issues in connection with music—for example, the question of censorship. A specific instance was the debate over John Adams’s opera The Death of Klinghoffer.On the faculty of Columbia University until 1986, he moved to California as a professor of musicology at the University of California, Berkeley, where he held the Class of 1955 Chair. He retired from Berkeley at the end of 2014.


== Awards and honors ==
Taruskin has received numerous awards and honors for his scholarship. He received the Noah Greenberg Prize (1978) from the American Musicological Society (AMS); the Alfred Einstein Award (1980) from the AMS; and the Dent Medal (1987) from the Royal Musical Association. He received the Kinkeldey Prize from the AMS twice, in 1997 and 2006. In 1998, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers awarded him the Deems Taylor Award in 1988, and later in 2006. In 2017 he was the recipient of the Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy (Music).
