Gert Tony Hubert Verhulst (born 24 January 1968 in Berchem) is a Belgian presenter, entrepreneur, singer, autodidact, director, actor, screenwriter, composer, film producer, millionaire & business magnate. As a prominent figure within the children's entertainment industry in the Benelux, he is regarded as a Flemish cultural icon, known for his influence and contributions to children's entertainment in the Benelux and founder of Studio 100.


== Life and career ==

Verhulst already knew on a very early age that he wanted to become famous (own words). In 1987 he applied at the "Koninkijk Conservatorium Antwerpen" (translated: The Royal Academy of fine Arts Antwerp) where he was rejected, he would recall this as a gift from Heaven. Later that year he got his first job at the former BRTN (now VRT) as continuity announcer.


=== Samson en Gert ===
Samson & Gert is a Flemish children's television series produced by Eline van Noppen, centered on the talking dog Samson and his owner Gert. In its entire run, the show was originally aired on TV1 from Christmas Day 1989 until 1 December 1997, where it moved to Ketnet and continues airing all of its episodes to this day. As a continuity announcer Verhulst wanted to make the announcements before children's television programmes more appealing by having an animal puppet next to him. He got in touch with puppeteer Danny Verbiest, who created the puppet dog Samson. Samson, an Old English Sheepdog, made his screen debut on 2 September 1989. The pair's popularity grew very rapidly in Flanders and they were given their own television series in 1990. The show, named Samson, premiered on 2 September 1990. During the show, Samson and Gert and their friends would encounter many funny and chaotic situations. The plot would be interrupted for contests, fan mail and a variety of cartoons, such as The Smurfs, Ovide and the Gang, and Mrs. Pepper Pot.


=== Zeg eens Euh! ===
Verhulst presented the language game "Zeg eens Euh!" (translated: Say Uh!) It was a game that was broadcast on Friday between 1992 and 1997 and whose concept was clearly inspired by the British radio game, Just a Minute. The panelists alternately were given a theme that they had to talk about for one minute. Together with the theme they got a banned word that they could not use. In the panel were four Flemish celebrities including: "Emiel Goelen", "Margriet Hermans", "Koen Crucke" & "Jaak Pijpen". Occasionally one of these panelists was replaced by "Mark Tijsmans", "Andrea Croonenberghs", "Walter Baele" & "Paul Ambach". During the summer months, the viewer share rose from 700,000 to 800,000 viewers. When Verhulst moved to Vtm, "Donaat Deriemaecker" took over the game but after a scandal involving one of the panel members, Emiel Goelen, the show was dismissed.


=== Move to VTM ===
In 1997 Verhulst moved to Vtm where he presented "Wat zegt u?" (translated: What do you say ?). This was followed by "Linx" and in the summer of 1998 Verhulst presented "Sterrenslag" (translated: Star battle) for several weeks because presenter 'Herbert Bruynseels' had had to withdraw due to illness. In the summer of 1999, the dialect game "Watte?" (translated What?) started with the panel members: "Walter De Donder", "Koen Crucke" and "Simonne Peeters".
