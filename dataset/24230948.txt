== Biography ==
Marina Goglidze-Mdivani was born on October 6, 1936 in Tbilisi, Georgian SSR. Her father was the well known chess player Victor Goglidze. In 1954 she graduated from the Tbilisi State Conservatory with honors, receiving the gold medal. There, she was taught by Evgenia Tcherniavskaya. From 1955 to 1960, she studied at the Moscow Conservatory under Jacob Milstein, and subsequently completed post-graduate studies under the tutelage of Emil Gilels.  Upon graduation, she commenced an eight-week tour of the United States, culminating on November 27, 1963 at Carnegie Hall in New York City.  At that time Mdivani’s impresario was the renowned Sol Hurok. For the next twenty-five years, she was a principal soloist of the Moscow Philharmonic Society.  Mdivani's career as orchestral soloist and recitalist took her throughout Europe, Russia and North and South America.
In 1961, she participated in and won Le Premier Prix at the Concours International Marguerite Long-Jacques Тhibaud in Paris.  In 1962, she competed in the Second International Tchaikovsky Competition, where she was awarded the 4th prize. The competition that year is known as one of the stiffest piano competitions in history.
Mdivani has taught at institutions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East and has also served on the juries of international competitions.
In 1992 Mdivani joined the faculty of the Schulich School of Music of McGill University in Montreal. Throughout her career, Mdivani mastered a very large repertoire including approximately 40 concertos, a vast number of chamber works, and countless solo piano works. Often, her programs were unusual; for example, on January 24, 1986 in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, Mdivani performed all five piano concertos of Sergei Prokofiev in one concert.  She has had a long and esteemed music career, performing in more than 3,000 recitals. In 1976, she was awarded the honorable title of a People's Artist of the Republic of Georgia.
Mdivani has lived in Montreal since 1992 with her family Ekaterina and Anna Mdivani.
