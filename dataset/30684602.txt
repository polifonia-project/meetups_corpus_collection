== Musical style ==
Mixmag describes Gesaffelstein's style as being a "dark and threatening techno, though enchanting"; The Inrocks see it as "black, ultra-violent music, [which] revives the techno fundamentals, the intransigence of Underground Resistance, the mental and obsessive structures of Drexciya, the contemporary power and more". Megan Buerger from the Washington Post describes his style as a mixture of dark and underground music, and notes that a specialty of the artist is his use of silences to create a "tension" before a "raucous explosion of bass and percussion".Rolling Stone magazine sees his music as being "a little more aggressive and punk-rock than normal".


== Influences ==
Gesaffelstein cites as references Dopplereffekt, Kraftwerk, but also new wave formations from the 80s such as D.A.F. or Nitzer Ebb. He also appreciates Joy Division and The Hacker also influenced him a lot.
