Throughout his childhood, his parents ran a hair salon from their home in the Hiroshima Prefecture. During his younger years, he was active as a Johnny's Jr. He decided to quit when he began attending CALESS Vocal & Dance School (キャレスボーカル&ダンススクール) in Osaka.In 2001, Hiroki took part in the Junon Super Boy Contest; however, he landed 24th place and was unable to advance. The following year in 2002, he formed the group "Rhymix" with Shinya Taniuchi and Akira Kagimoto, who had also attended CALESS Vocal & Dance School. In March 2002, the trio began doing live street performances on the streets of Shiroten at Osaka Castle Park. By May 2002, they renamed the group from "Rhymix" to "flow" and began performing by Kyobashi Station. In May, they recruited the winner of the Kyushu/Fukuoka Joint Starlight Audition (九州・沖縄合同スターライトオーディション), Keita Furuya, before changing their name once more to "Lead".In 2007, Hiroki wrote and composed his first song titled "Kimi ~Sakura~". The song would later be placed on Lead's 2009 single GiraGira Romantic.During his time with Lead, Hiroki starred in several films and television shows, most notably Pink no Idenshi, where he played the titular character "Taichi Kobayashi" alongside actress Narumi Konno. He would also become a recurring guest on a number of variety shows, including TV Asahi's "More TV!" (もらえるテレビ!). He would also star in musicals alongside his fellow group members. In 2010, he starred as Tsurumi Akihiko in the television drama Tumbling.After Lead celebrated their tenth anniversary with the Leader's Party 10! concert for their fan club on March 30, 2013 at Zepp Tokyo, Hiroki stepped away from the group due to the belief that his bandmates had surpassed his abilities and he "shouldn't be with members who are aiming higher". Prior to his final decision, the other members questioned if they should remain as a unit if Hiroki decided to leave. When Hiroki finalized his decision, with full support to the others as a group, they chose to stay together.Hiroki became a freelance hairdresser after leaving the group, working at a hair salon in Tokyo called "Shout." On November 1, 2019, he opened up his own salon in Yoga, Setagaya called "heena".
