== Early life ==
I Self Devine was born in Los Angeles, California and moved to Minnesota with his mom when she got accepted to the University of Minnesota's social work master's program. He says, "The first time that I became aware of hip-hop was in 1979, when my mom gave me "Rapper's Delight," the 12-inch." He experimented with graffiti writing, freestyling, DJing, and breakdancing before starting to invest lots of time into rapping and graffiti.


== Career ==
I Self Devine released the solo debut album, Self Destruction, on Rhymesayers Entertainment in 2005. He released the second solo album, The Sound of Low Class Amerika, on the label in 2012. It was produced by Medium Zach of Big Quarters, DJ Todda, Benzilla, King Karnov, Vitamin D, Jake One, Proh Mic, and I Self Devine himself. The album was preceded by four mixtapes, which were all released in early 2012. In 2015, he released a collaborative album with Muja Messiah, titled 9th House. In an interview with The Current (KCMP), he stated that he was expecting to release two albums in 2021: Rituals of Resilience and That Which Is Hidden.


== Live shows ==
I Self Devine is celebrated for his live shows. Spectrum Culture wrote that he "is synonymous with a dynamic live show."


== Personal life ==
I Self Devine has five children and has made efforts to prioritize his family over his career. He told The Current, "To think about emceeing or even being a community organizer â€” those are great things and have big impacts. But to me, when all of my kids are together, I feel rich beyond belief. I feel crazy wealthy, like I got gold as far as you can see."
