== Career ==


=== Infinite Challenge (2009-2014) ===
Gil made his first appearance on an episode which featured Korean figure skater Kim Yuna in April 2009, ostensibly substituting for Jeong Jun-ha, who had to leave the episode recording early. He remained a de facto member of Infinite Challenge until he became a full member later that year. During the Boxing episodes in January 2010, Gil showed off his 9-year-long training in the sport. Gil is often called the Unfunny Friend due to his inability to ad-lib as quickly as the other co-hosts.
In 2012, both of Leesang members, Gil and Gary, who worked as the main concert organizer of Infinite Challenge: Super 7 concert announced their departure from their respective variety shows, because of high ticket price protests. The concert itself eventually canceled. On the other hand, they still continued their participation as variety show cast after the controversy calmed down.


=== The Voice Korea (2012-2013) ===
With his commentaries, Gil has shown that underneath his rugged hip-hop exterior, he is a warm and rather approachable individual. Consistently offering warm words of encouragement and advice to his disciples to help them ease their anxious hearts, and lightening up the atmosphere with his witty sense of humor, he has become an indispensable personality on the program.


=== Hiatus (2014) ===
After the DUI incident, he took a hiatus from any public activities including TV appearances and concerts.


=== Show Me The Money (2016) ===
Gill joined MNET's fifth season of the TV rap competition Show Me the Money in 2016 as one of the producers with Mad Clown as Team Gill & Mad Clown.
