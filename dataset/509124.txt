== Biography ==
Although born in France, Gilmore grew up in the Seattle area. After playing in 10 Minute Warning with Duff McKagan (The Fartz, Guns N' Roses), Steve Verwolf, Paul Dana, Bob Groves, and David Garrigues, Gilmore decided to join his friend Duff McKagan when he announced he was leaving Seattle for a new life in L.A, and accompanied him in his early auditions. Shortly after the success of Guns N' Roses, he moved back to Seattle and in the late 1980s Gilmore was a member of the critically acclaimed, seminal Seattle band Mother Love Bone along with bandmates Andrew Wood (vocals), Bruce Fairweather (guitar), Jeff Ament (bass), and Stone Gossard (guitar). After Wood's death from a heroin overdose, Ament and Gossard went on to play key roles in Pearl Jam.
Gilmore went on to collaborate with Seattle engineer and producer Jack Endino, with whom he would release Angle of Attack (1990) and Endino's Earthworm (1992). In the ensuing years, Gilmore would collaborate with a wide variety of musicians on releases such as: Land's Archipelago (1997) and Doghead's eponymous 1996 release. In the liner notes of Down on the Upside (1996), Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil credits Gilmore with "inspiration" for the song "Never the Machine Forever".
1999 saw the release of the eponymous debut album by Radio Chongqing, which Gilmore recorded with bandmates Lesli Dalaba (trumpet) and George Soler (stick).
As of 2007 he has been playing with Steve Fisk and working on several other recording projects.
