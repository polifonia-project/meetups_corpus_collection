Takuya Kuroda (Japanese: 黒田 卓也, Hepburn: Kuroda Takuya, born 21 February 1980, in Ashiya, Hyōgo) is a Japanese jazz trumpeter and arranger.

Kuroda came to music by joining his school's big band. Later he frequently visited jam sessions in Kobe. In 2003 he moved to the United States and was a course participant at Berklee College of Music before settling in Brooklyn, New York City. At the much less expensive College of Performing Arts of The New School he studied Jazz and Contemporary Music, earning his degree in 2006. His study colleague José James became a close friend and musical partner, in 2014 producing his studio album Rising Son.
