Campbell took part in the Dutch Eurovision selection in 1992, when his song Wijs me de weg (English version; Open your eyes) was chosen from 12 entrants as the country's representative in the 37th Eurovision Song Contest, held in Malmö, Sweden on 9 May. Performing last of the 23 entrants and joined on stage by brothers Carlo and Ben, Campbell finished the evening in ninth place. Campbell's backing singers in Malmö included Ruth Jacott; the following year Campbell would return the favour by appearing as a backing singer when Jacott represented the Netherlands in the 1993 Eurovision Song Contest.
