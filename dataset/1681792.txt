Ulf Gunnar Ekberg (born 6 December 1970), also known as Buddha, is a Swedish singer-songwriter, musician, businessman and television and film producer, best known as a founding member of the pop group Ace of Base, along with siblings Jonas Berggren, Linn Berggren and Jenny Berggren.


== Life and career ==
Ace of Base released its debut album in 1992 and went on to attain major chart success throughout the 1990s.
Ekberg has produced several artists, TV productions, films and events and has sold over 50 million records world wide.In 2009, he started a new music production/publishing and management company together with Jonas Berggren based in LA, London and Stockholm.After Ekberg experienced the tsunami in Phuket, Thailand, he founded the Surin Relief Fund to support affected children by providing facilities to educate children and care for orphaned children.In its 27 March 1993 edition, the Swedish newspaper Expressen reported that Ekberg had once been a member of a band called "Commit Suiside" [sic], which sang songs with explicit racist lyrics. Commit Suiside was a band active in Gothenburg from 1983 to 1986, when Ulf was between the ages of 13 and 16. In 1998, some of these purported songs were released on the unauthorized compilation album Uffe was a Nazi!. Ekberg claims that the cited songs were not recorded by Commit Suiside, but says he regrets this past part of his life as a big mistake.  Other media outlets reported that Ekberg had been a neo-nazi skinhead.Ekberg has criticized and abandoned this part of his life multiple times since its report. In the 1997 documentary Our Story, Ekberg said: "I told everyone I really regret what I've done. I closed that book. I don't want to even talk about it, that time does not exist in me any more. I closed it and I threw the book away 1987. I took the experience from it, I learned from it. But that life is not me. It's somebody else." In 2013, he said: "During the early 1990s I did dozens of interviews, all around the world, about the people I sometimes found myself surrounded by in the 1980s and how profoundly regretful I am now about associating with such individuals. Those interviews covered every aspect of my past as I strove to be an open book to anyone who asked. [...] The teenage mistakes I did make in terms of my chosen ideas at the time were unfortunate and if I were to live through those days again I would have done things very differently! I’m truly deeply sorry for any hurt and disappointment this has caused for our fans and I want to be very clear that Ace of Base never shared any of these opinions and strongly oppose all extremist opinions on both the right and left wing."
