Gavin Bradley is a Canadian singer-songwriter and producer based in Toronto who has worked with artists like Nelly Furtado, Tori Amos and Jane Siberry. Fusing acoustic and electronic elements, his work is identifiable for its signature "warm" piano sound and live strings mixed with filtered synthesizers and other electronic manipulations 1. Besides production, Bradley is a solo recording artist. His debut album 'Deep Freeze' was released on UMI Records in 2006.


== Early years ==
Growing up in Ottawa, Bradley began studying classical piano at four. At age 10, he obtained a pre-1900 Nordheimer upright piano. Bradley eventually used a sampler to record each key of this oddly detuned piano at many different volumes, recreating a digital version of it to be used as an organic centerpiece in his recordings and later on in his live shows.  Also studying jazz saxophone from 14, saxophonists Stuart Matthewman of Sade, Branford Marsalis and John Coltrane were early influences.
In his early teens Bradley developed a strong interest in creating and manipulating music electronically using synthesizers, turntables, tape splicing and effects units.  Some electronic influences Bradley cites are experimental Toronto band Syrinx led by Anne Murray keyboardist John Mills-Cockell, early Pink Floyd, Tomita, Giorgio Moroder, Eurythmics, Yaz, Thomas Dolby, Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode, New Order, William Orbit and Björk.


== Early studio work ==
In 1991, Bradley relocated to Toronto to study film and music at York University and began a residency at Toronto club Work.  In 1992 he began an apprenticeship in Toronto recording studio Number Nine Sound and later was an assistant engineer at R&B production house TazzDab Productions.  His early production work included remixes for R&B singer Carlos Morgan, Canadian independent artist Jane Siberry and as well as Sony Music artist Esthero.


== Collaborations ==
Through Esthero's manager, Canadian Idol judge Zack Werner, Bradley met and began collaborating with Jon Levine, songwriter and keyboard player for The Philosopher Kings.  Together they worked with EMI artist Dayna Manning and received a Best R&B Recording Juno Award for JackSoul's 'Sleepless' album on BMG Records. In 2007 they collaborated on 'Calling to Say' for EMI artist Serena Ryder, which rose to No. 1 on the Canadian charts.
Bradley's work on Nelly Furtado's third album 'Loose' brought him to the attention of Los Angeles writer-producer Rick Nowels resulting in collaborations on material for Joss Stone, Kylie Minogue, Charlotte Church and Shaznay Lewis of All Saints.  Holly Knight, another Los Angeles writer-producer brought Bradley in to work on material for The Donnas, Alaina Beaton and Joe Elliot of Def Leppard.
In 2009 Bradley began composing music for film and theatre. He was nominated for an Outstanding Sound Design/Composition Dora Award for the Darren Anthony play Secrets of a Black Boy.


== Solo singer-songwriter work ==
In 2006 Bradley released 'Deep Freeze', his first solo album as a singer-songwriter, on Prozzak/Philosopher Kings guitarist James Bryan's label UMI Records.  In Canadian newspaper The National Post interviewer Mike Doherty refers to 'Bradley's trademark piano, which sounds as though it were recorded underwater'2.  In that article, Bradley explains that his breathy vocals and organic piano sound are intentionally set against inhuman, icy beats and sterile analog synthesizer sweeps to accentuate their warmth and humanness by contrast. In 2006 and 2007 Bradley toured the album in Canada with James Bryan's project Sunshine State.  The tracks 'In The Way', 'Games', 'Love Song 1968', 'I Wonder Where You Are' and 'Deep Freeze' enjoyed radio play in Canada and the U.S.
The full-length 'Daylight Fading Out' was released in 2012, followed by the 'Sea & Space' EP in 2013, both on Bradley's own Afternoon Tea label.


== House music projects ==
Under the alias Gavo, Bradley has also produced a steady stream of remixes including work for Atlantic Records artist Tori Amos, EMI artist Thomas Dolby and Nelly Furtado.  In 2000 his remix of Furtado's 'I'm Like A Bird' was cited as a Dance Hot Plate in Billboard Magazine.
Bradley also maintains ongoing collaborations with Toronto DJ Dwayne Minard with disco-house project Righteous and electro-funk project White Punks On Dope.  The Righteous single 'Love Is Love' featuring New York singer MJ White on vocals was released on the prestigious UK-based Hed Kandi label.  White Punks On Dope have performed live at various locales around Toronto, including Shane Percy's Candybar party series in 2007. House singles recorded with Toronto DJ Deko-ze have been released on Toronto-based Hi-Bias Records under the moniker Deko-ze'n'Gavo.
