Pierre de Corbie (died after 1195) was an early trouvère from the Île-de-France. He is probably the same person as the magister Petrus de Corbeia ("master Peter of Corbie") who served as a canon at Notre Dame d'Arras between 1188 and 1195. All seven of his surviving songs are found in only a few sources; all the melodies are in bar form and several songs have been assigned different melodies by different sources:

Dame, ne vous doit desplaire
En aventure ai chante (several melodies)
Esbahis en lonc voiage
Limounier, du marriage (two melodies)
Par un ajournant
Pensis com fins amourous
Amis Guillaume, ainc si sage ne vi (several melodies)All his songs are typical chansons courtoises save the last one above, which is a jeu-parti.
