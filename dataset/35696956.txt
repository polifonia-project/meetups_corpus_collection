Bill Cheatham was a roadie for the original Stooges, and in 1970 joined the group on second guitar. Cheatham was a member during the time the band played at Ungano's Club in New York City from which the release Have Some Fun: Live At Ungano's was taken. Cheatham's tenure was short-lived, and by December 1970 James Williamson joined Ron Asheton as the Stooges' second guitarist.
Cheatham died sometime in the late 1990s.
