== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Born in Monticello, Mississippi, United States, Smith's early music experiences revolved around gospel music. Orphaned, Smith was brought up by his uncle and aunt. In his teenage years he moved to Arizona to work on a cattle ranch and played in a country and western band on weekends. He worked in construction and local farmhands taught him to play the double bass. Around this time Smith showed an interest in boxing, so his aunt bought Smith an electric bass guitar to encourage him to follow a musical path instead.


=== Career ===
Smith migrated to Chicago in the mid-1950s with his wife, Etta Mae. In the early 1960s he began performing in clubs, learning guitar from J. B. Lenoir (his first cousin who had encouraged him to migrate), Robert Lockwood, Jr., and Hubert Sumlin. He worked regularly as rhythm guitarist for Otis Rush. During this period he recorded a number of singles with labels such as Bea & Baby, Cruise and Apex but in 1965 returned to his gospel roots with a group called the Gospel Travellers. In the 1970s he joined the house band at Theresa’s Tavern where he worked for five years, often playing with Junior Wells. In 1974 he recorded various tracks with Sunnyland Slim for Slim's later album 'She Got A Thing Goin' On'. In the late 1970s, Smith toured with the likes of Big Mama Thornton and George "Harmonica" Smith.After years playing in clubs all over the world, a demo tape Smith recorded became the album Tell Me How You Like It, released by the Texas-based Grits record label. His next release in the United Kingdom was Addressing the Nation with the Blues for JSP Records. In 1995, Smith retired from his job at Economy Folding Box Company after twenty-five years, allowing him to focus fully on music.

King".Byther Smith died in Chicago on September 10, 2021, aged 89.
