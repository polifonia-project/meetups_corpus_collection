== Life ==

In his childhood, Drews lived in  Schleswig. After finishing school, he went on to study medicine at the University of Kiel, but dropped out of medical school to work as a singer. At age 15 he received an award as Best Banjo Player of Schleswig-Holstein, while playing in jazz band the Schnirpels. At school he played in "The Monkeys". In 1967 he was solo guitarist in the Kiel based psychedelic rock band "Chimes of Freedom", later renamed by its manager to "Die Anderen" (The Others). In that same year, Drews took on his first acting role in the German film comedy Zur Hölle mit den Paukern. He sang for the 70's pop group the "Les Humphries Singers" and started a solo career. He had a German number one hit in 1976 with "Ein Bett im Kornfeld", an adaptation of the Bellamy Brothers' "Let Your Love Flow" which was also a German number one.
In the U.S., he had only one moderate hit with "Don't Want No-Body" on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1981. The single was credited to J.D. Drews and it peaked at #79.
Drews' first marriage was to German actress and model Corinna Drews (née Gillwald) from 1981 until 1985, with whom he has one son. Since 1995 Drews has been married to German actress and model Ramona Drews (née Mittendorf), with whom he has one daughter, Joelina Drews. He lives in Dülmen-Rorup in Germany and spends a lot of his time working on the Spanish island Majorca, where he styles himself as the King of Majorca ("König von Mallorca") since being called that on prime-time German television by Thomas Gottschalk in the show Wetten, dass..?. 
In 2011 he opened a restaurant in Santa Ponsa, Majorca in 2011. It is  called "König von Mallorca – Kultbistro" and is decorated with memorabilia and awards from Drews' music career.
