It was pre-internet; I really had to try to find my audiences by going out on tour. Men at Work really didn't build a foundational audience. We came in as a pop band with enormous radio success; once that goes away and the band breaks up the audience tends to go away with it. You're left with what you want to make of it. When you start out doing those tours, you start again [and] you tend not to attract a very big number of people. I'd play to a hundred people or sometimes less."In December 2013, Hay announced on his website that he was done touring "for the time being" and would spend 2014 writing and recording.In February 2015, Hay released his twelfth studio album, Next Year People.
