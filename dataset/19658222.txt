They toured Australia and were accompanied by vocalist, Jeanne Lewis.Michael Foster of The Canberra Times reviewed Graeme Bell's album, Pop Goes Graeme Bell, in December 1973 and observed, "Apart from Bell's piano, which generally drives the band along, I liked breaks and interpolations by [Furniss] in alto, clarinet, soprano sax, flute and, an instrument which crops up rarely and takes some mastery for effective use, tin whistle."As a professional, he worked with Bob Learmouth, Bull, and Bell. He founded and led the Eclipse Valley Five and led the San Francisco Jazz Band with Tom Baker. He has also played with Mike Bukovsky and Bernie McGann.
