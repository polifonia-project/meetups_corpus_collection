Rossi has scored music for many silent films such as Silent Shakespeare and Jane Shore for the British Film Institute. She was commissioned by the Imperial War Museum in 2006 to write an orchestral score to accompany the digitally restored 1916 film The Battle of the Somme. In the centenary year 100 live orchestral screenings of the film with Rossi's score took place worldwide to mark the 100th anniversary of the Battle.
In 2014, Rossi's work Voices of Remembrance, inspired by ten of World War I's most famous poems, was recorded with the Chamber Orchestra of London with readings by Vanessa Redgrave and Ralph Fiennes.
