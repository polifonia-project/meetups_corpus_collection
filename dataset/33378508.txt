== Biography ==
Sipiagin was born on June 11, 1967. He moved from Russia to the U.S. in 1990. His first major job in the U.S. was with the Gil Evans Band. He has played with Dave Holland, Mingus Big Band, Michael Brecker, and Mulgrew Miller. He has recorded many albums as a leader, twelve of them for Criss Cross Jazz. Sipiagin is a founding member of the band Opus 5 with Seamus Blake, David Kikoski, Boris Kozlov, and Donald Edwards.
