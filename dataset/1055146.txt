== Career ==


=== Music ===
Green attended Emerson College for one semester in 1998 before leaving to concentrate on his music, going on to co-found the Moldy Peaches with Kimya Dawson. In 2002, the Moldy Peaches went on hiatus, and both Green and Dawson embarked on solo careers.Green released several albums on Rough Trade Records. Among his better known songs are "Jessica" (about singer Jessica Simpson), "Novotel", "Friends of Mine",  "Dance with Me", "Carolina" and "Emily", and in the UK, his cover of The Libertines track "What a Waster". "Jessica" (#63, 2004) and "Emily" (#53, 2005) both appeared in the UK Singles Chart.Prior to Jacket Full of Danger in 2006, all of Green's albums had been released on the 22nd of the month.
In January 2008, the Moldy Peaches began having a resurgence in popularity, due to their music being included in the hit indie film, Juno. Most notably, a duet between Green and Dawson, the Moldy Peaches song "Anyone Else But You" was featured in the film, and also in a scene which featured the film's lead actors, Michael Cera and Elliot Page performing the song together. The soundtrack album reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart on its third week of release.
In January 2010, Green released his sixth solo album, Minor Love, which was a slight departure from his previous works. Green says he wrote many of these songs in a clearer style so they were easier for the listener to understand. He also says the album was slightly more produced, creating a more offsetting sound, rather than being raw, and simple like his earlier work. Later in 2010, he also released another album, Musik for a Play, which was a collection of instrumentals made for a play soundtrack. For his next album, Green expressed interest in making a heavy metal-like album.
Following the release of these albums, Green took time off from making music, and focused his work as an artist and filmmaker. But he still performed during this time, even doing some shows with singer Binki Shapiro. In 2012, Green made references to an upcoming duet album with Shapiro, which was eventually announced in October 2012 on Green's website. The song "Here I Am" from the album was also made available for download online. The album was released on January 29, 2013. Green is recording his next album, the soundtrack to his film Aladdin.In September 2019 Green released the album "Engine of Paradise" via Danger Mouse's record label 30th Century Records.

A portion of "Teen Tech's" proceeds went to benefit Artists for Peace and Justice, an effort to re-create and cultivate sustainability in Haiti. On June 9, 2012 Green's exhibition "Cartoon & Complaint" opened at Dustin Yellin's art center and gallery The Intercourse in Red Hook, Brooklyn. In August 2012 The Hole Gallery in New York City announced that it would be showing a summer exhibition of Green's work titled "Houseface", a collection of works inspired by De Stijl and the architecture of Friedensreich Hundertwasser and Antoni Gaudí. Green's Houseface paintings and sculptures were featured in a Stuart Weitzman shoe advertisement directed by James Franco entitled "Walking After Midnight". Afterwards he formed an art collective named 3MB with Macaulay Culkin and Toby Goodshank. Their first exhibit Leisure Inferno opened at Le Poisson Rouge Gallery in October 2012. Green kicked off 2013 with "Medieval Businessmen," an exhibit of drawings and paintings at Loyal Gallery in Sweden. In July he showed his visual art for the first time in Italy with "The Yellow Show", a solo-exhibition that opened at Motel Salieri in Rome. The next month he had a show in Zurich with "From A Darker Time," a show composed of older works. In September 2013 Green took part in a collaborative artshow with Pete Doherty and Fionn Regan entitled "Noise Kids.
