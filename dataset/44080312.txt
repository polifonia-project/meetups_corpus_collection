=== Career beginnings ===
In late 2007, Sium capitalized upon the promotional capacity of the internet and used Myspace as a platform to expand the reach of his music. He captured the attention of Hannah Kang, general manager for Atlanta-based record label Grand Hustle Records and was introduced to American rapper and Grand Hustle label-boss, T.I. In 2008, Sium had signed a recording contract with Grand Hustle Records. In 2008, Sium was featured on a song titled “Collect Call”, which was included as a bonus track on T.I.’s highly acclaimed sixth album, Paper Trail.

== Artistry ==


=== Voice and songwriting ===
The in-house disc jockey of Grand Hustle, DJ MLK, has described Sium as "sound[ing] like a young Maxwell." In 2012, American radio show host and internet celebrity B. Scott, wrote in a review that he "sounds a bit like Maxwell meets Van Hunt". Also in 2012, after the release of a song titled "Irene", from Sium's mixtape of the same name, grownfolksmusic.com wrote "Mitchelle’l already has a smooth, soulful vibe going that is reminiscent of artists like Maxwell and Robin Thicke and works just fine without a guest rapper. Hopefully there are more sensual, smoothed-out tracks like this one coming down the line from Mitchelle’l."


=== Influences ===
Mitchelle’l grew up listening to and was deeply inspired by the kings of soul music, including Marvin Gaye, Al Green and Otis Redding. He later gravitated towards more contemporary R&B offerings from R. Kelly, Jodeci and D’Angelo. As he began to create music, he incorporated the elements that had inspired him from a musical sense along with the things he experienced in the world around him.
