Yafeu Akiyele Fula (October 9, 1977 â€“ November 10, 1996), better known by his stage name Yaki Kadafi, was an American rapper and a founder and member of the hip hop groups Outlawz and Dramacydal.


== Early life and education ==
Yafeu Fula was born in the Bronx, New York City, on October 9, 1977, to Sekou Odinga and Yaasmyn Fula. When he was four years old his father Odinga was arrested and imprisoned; he was raised by his mother and adopted her surname.Kadafi's parents were both members of the Black Panther Party. Yaasmyn Fula and Tupac Shakur's mother, Afeni Shakur, were close friends, and Kadafi and Tupac were friends until their respective deaths in 1996.


== Career ==
In 1994, Fula ran into his childhood friend Mutah "Napoleon" Beale. Yafeu's mother introduced Napoleon to Tupac Shakur, and all three created Dramacydal. Yafeu, only 16, took on the stage name "Young Hollywood". The group appeared on Tupac's album Me Against the World.
In 1995, upon Tupac's release from prison, Kadafi met with him to sign with Death Row. He guest-starred on Tupac's All Eyez on Me and featured on three songs. The Outlawz recorded frequently with Tupac throughout 1996.
Fula also teamed up with fellow Outlawz member Hussein Fatal to record material under the name "Fatal-N-Felony".
On September 13, 1996, Tupac died after being shot multiple times in a drive-by shooting near the Las Vegas Strip on September 7. Kadafi was in the car directly behind Tupac, and claimed to have seen a white Cadillac pull up alongside him and open fire.


== Death ==
Kadafi was shot and killed in Orange, New Jersey, on November 10, 1996, not quite two months after Tupac's death. Police found his body in the hallway of a friend's apartment building while responding to a report of gunfire. The friend, Roddy Beale, told his cousin Napoleon that he had accidentally shot Kadafi; he turned himself in to police and served "7 or 8 years" in prison. Kadafi's mother responded that it was not an accident, that Beale had threatened her son and that his family had since threatened witnesses to the threat. Kadafi is buried at Glendale Cemetery, Bloomfield.
