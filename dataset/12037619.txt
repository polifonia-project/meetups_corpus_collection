Brian Godding (born 19 August 1945, Monmouth, South Wales) is a pop, rock and jazz rock guitarist.


== Reviews ==
Regarding his 1988 solo album Slaughter on Shaftesbury Avenue, Dave Wayne in the New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock, said:

Intense jazz-rock fusion of the highest quality. Godding's guitar playing should please fans of McLaughlin and Holdsworth to no end. Heartily recommended to all fusion fans.
Reviewing the same album for the Dorset Echo, Marco Rossi said:

Fans of Allan Holdsworth, John Etheridge and John McLaughlin had best be sitting down with a fortifying cuppa when they hear, by way of example, "Blue Sun" from Godding's 1988 album Slaughter on Shaftesbury Avenue - a warm-toned, hugely imaginative and wholly involving sound picture on which Godding conjures forth such a powerfully hypnotic extended intro that I actually jumped out of my seat when the drums came in.
