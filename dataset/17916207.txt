== Biography ==
Scott Garrett grew up in Takoma Park, Maryland. Before age 10 he began drumming under the tutelage of William Frank Reichenbach Sr. legendary jazz drummer for Charlie Byrd, the Stan Getz album Jazz Samba, and co-developer of the jazz-samba drumming style and American wave of Bossa Nova enthusiasm.
From Reichenbach's training and exposure to the drum style in the D.C. area Go-Go Scotts's approach to meter and rhythm developed.


== Technique ==
In technical terms, "Go-go's essential beat is characterized by a syncopated, dotted rhythm that consists of a series of quarter and eighth notes (quarter, eighth, quarter, (space/held briefly), quarter, eighth, quarter)... which is underscored most dramatically by the bass drum and snare drum, and the hi-hat... [and] is ornamented by the other percussion instruments, especially by the conga drums, timbales, and hand-held cowbells.
