Tom Kennedy (born August 21, 1960 in St. Louis, Missouri) is an American double-bass and electric bass player.
Tom Kennedy is the son of a professional trumpet player. He began playing acoustic bass at the age of nine on a double-bass brought home by his older brother, jazz pianist Ray Kennedy. Soon he began to perform with many nationally recognized artists passing through the Midwest. By his 18th birthday, he had performed with Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Stitt, Stan Kenton, James Moody, Barney Kessel, Eddie Harris, George Russell, Nat Adderley, Peter Erskine, Bill Watrous and Freddie Hubbard.
Kennedy specialized in acoustic jazz until his introduction to the electric bass at the age of 17. Soon he was dividing his time between mainstream jazz and progressive jazz fusion. He moved to New York City in 1984. He has performed and recorded with Dave Weckl, Don Grolnick, Steve Khan, Randy Brecker, Benny Green, Bucky Pizzarelli, Bill Connors, Al Di Meola, Mike Stern, Steve Ferrone, and Junior Cook.
