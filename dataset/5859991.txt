Jon Dasilva is a British DJ and producer. As a former resident of Manchester club, The Ha√ßienda, he is widely regarded as an influential figure in the early UK house scene.


== Hacienda residency and DJ career ==
After graduating in Film and History from the University of Kent, Jon moved to Manchester. His mixing skills and innovative style were quickly noticed and he was soon offered a residency at legendary Manchester club, Fac 51 The Hacienda. Dasilva and DJ Mike Pickering started the wildly popular Ibiza-inspired HOT nights, which are seen by many as the birthplace of UK acid house, alongside Danny Rampling's Shoom.
During his residency at The Hacienda, he became well known for his use of a cappella vocals and sound effects. Such techniques influenced a new generation of young DJs, including Sasha, who credits Dasilva for teaching him how to mix harmonically and build sets.
Since leaving The Hacienda, Dasilva's career has taken him around the world. He was the first guest DJ to be booked by Slam (Soma Records) in Glasgow back in 1989, first UK DJ to play Tresor in Berlin around 1990. He was also one of the first British DJs to play China in the mid-90s, and was resident on the first Strictly Rhythm Records Tour alongside Todd Terry and a young Roger Sanchez. Since 2015 he has been one of the resident DJs at 'I Love Acid', currently the longest running dedicated, regular Acid House clubnight in the UK (established 2007) and winner of DJ Mag's Best Club Event 2019 award.
