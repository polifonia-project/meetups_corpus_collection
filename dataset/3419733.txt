Don Falcone (born November 5, 1958) is an American producer and multi-instrumentalist, and the guiding light behind the Spirits Burning space-rock collective. In Spirits Burning and other offshoot bands and projects, his primary collaborations have been with Albert Bouchard, Bridget Wishart, Cyrille Verdeaux, Daevid Allen, and English writer and musician Michael Moorcock.
Falcone was a member of Thessalonians and the original Melting Euphoria, and had a solo project called Spaceship Eyes.


== Biography ==


=== Early recordings ===
Falcone appeared on three albums released by Silent Records in 1993. 
He played keyboards and synthesizer on the album In A Garden of Eden by Heavenly Music Corporation, was in Satellite IV, which did the track “In A Sugarcube,” on the Fifty Years Of Sunshine compilation, and became a member of Thessalonians. On the Thessalonians album Soulcraft, Falcone played synthesizer.
In 1994, Falcone formed Melting Euphoria with Mychael Merrill and Anthony Who. Focusing on space rock, their debut recording was "Through the Strands of Time"; Falcone left the group soon after its release.Falcone played on two more Silent Records full-length albums as part of a trio, with fellow Thessolonians Kim Cascone and Paul Neyrinck, primarily under the name Spice Barons. Spice Barons also recorded as Astralfish, Hydrosphere, Patternclear, and Satellite IV.  Spice Barons, Patternclear, Astralfish and Hydrosphere appear on the Silent Records compilation UFA. The trio subsequently did an album under the name Spice Barons in 1995.


=== As Spaceship Eyes ===
In the mid-‘90's, Falcone started a solo project, Spaceship Eyes. It began as a synth project, and moved towards experimental drum ‘n' bass when he got signed to Cleopatra Records. The project was included on several drum and bass compilations and released the single "Cheebahcabra" on Hypnotic Records in 1997, followed by the LPs "Truth in the Eyes of a Spaceship" in 1998 and "Of Cosmic Repercussions" in 2000. Three of Falcone's Spaceship Eyes pieces appeared in the 1999 cult rave film Better Living Through Circuitry. Most notably, Mind The Alien from Truth In The Eyes Of A Spaceship was used as the film's opening track.


=== With Spirits Burning ===
In 1996, Falcone resurrected Spirits Burning. Spirits Burning was one of his first San Francisco bands, for which Falcone played bass and keyboards. Falcone set Spirits Burning on their continuing mission just as the internet began to open up an index of collaborative possibilities that studio recordings and logistics previously precluded: the chance for content-creators to recruit musicians on an ad hoc basis across the ether; musicians they’d have scant hope of playing with face-to-face. In the space-rock community, Falcone has done particularly well out of this approach. A survey of his first 10 years under the Spirits Burning banner throws up some surprising contributors (including Daevid Allen, Porcupine Tree’s Steven Wilson, and High Tide’s Simon House).In 2017, Falcone performed live with Spirits Burning, alongside Steve Bemand, Richard Chadwick, Kev Ellis, Colin Kafka, Martin Plumley, and Bridget Wishart. Falcone played keyboards and also sang lead vocals on two songs.


=== Various collaborations ===
Falcone, Albert Bouchard (formerly of Blue Öyster Cult), and writer Michael Moorcock have collaborated in Spirits Burning (under the name Spirits Burning & Michael Moorcock) to adapt two of Moorcock's novels: An Alien Heat and The Hollow Lands. Additionally, Falcone produced the 2019 Michael Moorcock & The Deep Fix release Live At The Terminal Café and was the executive producer for the band's Entropy Tango & Gloriana Demo Sessions release in 2012.
Falcone and Bridget Wishart (formerly of Hawkwind) have collaborated in Spirits Burning (including CDs released under the name Spirits Burning & Bridget Wishart), plus have an instrumental project called Astralfish.
Falcone and Cyrille Verdeaux of Clearlight have collaborated in Spirits Burning (under the name Spirits Burning & Clearlight). Additionally, Falcone produced the 2014 Clearlight release Impressionist Symphony.
Collaborating with Daevid Allen, Falcone released Glissando Grooves on Voiceprint Records in 2006.  Falcone and Allen were part of Weird Biscuit Teatime, which released their first album on Voiceprint in 2005, and the 2015 follow-up, "Elevenses," which was released under the band name Daevid Allen Weird Quartet. Falcone and Allen have collaborated in Spirits Burning (including a single released under the name Spirits Burning & Daevid Allen). In addition to Spirits Burning, Allen has contributed to other Falcone bands: Astralfish, Fireclan (which included members of Melting Euphoria), and Quiet Celebration (an ambient-ethno-jazz quartet).


=== Noh Poetry Records ===
Falcone is a co-founder of Noh Poetry Records, a California-based independent record label, whose releases include a Michael Moorcock & The Deep Fix album, as well as Where Stalks The Sandman: An Ambient Collection, which includes pieces by Steven Wilson, Praxis, Kim Cascone, Don Falcone, and others.
