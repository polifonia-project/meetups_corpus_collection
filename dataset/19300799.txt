== Biography ==
Rudolf Theodorus Palm is the grandson of Jan Gerard Palm (1831–1906) who is often referred to as the "father of Curaçao classical music". Like his cousin Jacobo Palm and his brother John Palm, at the age of seven Rudolf started to take lessons in music from his grandfather. Rudolf played several musical instruments such as piano, organ, saxophone, clarinet and flute.
