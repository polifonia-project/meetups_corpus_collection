== Early life ==
Aaron was born as Karen Lynn Greening in Belleville, Ontario, and began singing in school musicals at the age of five. She attended high school in Brampton, Ontario.
At age seventeen, Aaron was in a car accident, no surgery was required, but she did suffer a broken nose and badly bruised her face. However, years later Canadian Musician Magazine mistakenly embellished the incident into Aaron requiring complete facial reconstruction. The magazine printed a retraction in the following month's issue.

After singing in a music production when she was fifteen years old, she was asked to join a local rock group called "Lee Aaron".  She sang, played alto saxophone and keyboards in this first incarnation of the band, and took on the stage name of Lee Aaron.

The album featured well-known musicians of the Toronto music scene, including members of Moxy, Rif Raf3 (Q107 Homegrown Vol 4 / Lee Aaron Project band), Santers, and Triumph's Rik Emmett. Although the album was available in the UK only as an import, Aaron was invited to appear later that year at the Reading Festival.
In late 1982, Aaron flew to New York and posed topless for the men's magazine OUI. The magazine's March 1983 issue featured Aaron on the cover and in an interview. Aaron later concluded that posing for the magazine damaged her musical credibility; she regretted the decision and assigned blame for it to pressure from her manager.1984's recording of the album Metal Queen resulted in a multi-album deal with Attic Records. During the recording of Metal Queen, guitarist John Albani (ex-Wrabit) joined the band and he and Aaron formed a solid songwriting partnership that lasted eleven years.Between 1984 and 1992, Aaron toured extensively through Europe and made appearances in Japan and the United States.
