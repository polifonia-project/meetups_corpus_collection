Stacy Lattisaw Jackson (n√©e Lattisaw; born November 25, 1966) is an American R&B singer from Washington, D.C., United States.


== Career ==
The 1979 song "Ring My Bell" was originally written for then eleven-year-old Lattisaw, as a teenybopper song about kids talking on the telephone. When Lattisaw signed with a different label, Anita Ward was asked to sing it instead, and it became Ward's only major hit.Lattisaw recorded her first album for Cotillion Records at the age of 12 in 1979, under the direction of record producer Van McCoy. However, it was not until she affiliated with Narada Michael Walden, a former drummer with the Mahavishnu Orchestra who was just beginning a career as a producer, that she found larger success. Under Walden's direction, she scored several R&B hit albums between 1981 and 1986. She also opened for the Jacksons' Triumph Tour in 1981.During the 1980s and early 1990s, Lattisaw had several US R&B hit singles, and a 1980 top 3 hit in the UK with her song "Jump to the Beat". She also scored three moderate hits on the US Hot 100 chart; "Let Me Be Your Angel" (US No. 21), "Love on a Two-Way Street" (US No. 26), and "Miracles" (US No. 40). She signed with Motown Records in 1986. She scored her only No. 1 R&B hit with duet partner Johnny Gill, titled "Where Do We Go from Here", in 1989. Since the 1990s, she has exclusively sung gospel music. Her official website stated that she was to work on a gospel CD. In 2010, Lattisaw's music career was chronicled on the TV One docu-series Unsung, in which she also appeared.
