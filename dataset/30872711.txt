Mononc' Serge (real name Serge Robert) is a Québécois musician and poet who sings in French. He is best known for his vulgar lyrics and his irreverent songs making fun of local celebrities and politicians. He is also quite sardonic with the Quebec federalist movement, and their counterparts in the Rest Of Canada (R.O.C.). "Mononc' Serge" is French for "Uncle Serge".


== History ==
Serge was recruited in 1991 by Dédé Fortin to play bass with Les Colocs. He stayed with the band until 1995, then began a solo career as Mononc' Serge.
His 2001 album Mon voyage au Canada (My Trip to Canada) features one song for each Canadian province and territory, mostly poking fun at each of them.
In 2003 he teamed up with the thrash metal band Anonymus, and released an album named L'Académie du Massacre, which contains metal versions of Mononc' Serge's songs, along with a few new compositions. They later released a DVD titled La Pâques Satanique. In 2008, reunited with Anonymus for a new album, titled Musique Barbare.
