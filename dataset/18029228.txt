== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Kawamoto grew up hearing her mother playing the piano. Aside from learning piano, she also studied ballet for about two years and joined the boys' and girls' chorus and took flute lessons.  Her life was changed upon seeing a rock festival held in the nearby Prefectural Hall in her high school days.  Kawamoto entered the Jin-ai Women's College music department, piano department and formed a band.  After graduating from college, Kawamoto found a job at a company and became a piano teacher. However, since she only received a salary of 40,000 yen, she got fed up with her job and quit. Still, she continued to teach piano in her parents' house. She earned her livelihood working at a wedding hall, during which time she continued to try forming a band.
Kawamoto participated in "AIDS against FUKUI" held in Fukui as a band. She wrote the song and made all the members in the hall sing on the pretext of being elected to the executive committee. Because of that, she was invited to Sony’s "Showcase" where amateurs perform live in audition style. Since she was pleased with Tokyo, she saved 1 million yen within half a year, and went to Tokyo at the age of 21. She had a feeling that they liked her performance, but her position was still ambiguous for a while. She worked hard at composition while working part-time in a strange city.  Although poor, she lived happily.


=== Major label days ===
Because Kawamoto often went to the head office of Sony Music Entertainment Japan, she got to know the staff of the management office, and she signed a contract with them at the age of 22.
It was decided that Kawamoto would release a CD from the second production department of Sony.
She practised acoustic guitar hard to reproduce the sound of the demo tape of her debut single "Ai no Sainō" which Yasuyuki Okamura produced.
She was given the stage name of "Makoto Kawamoto" and made her debut as a singer.
She lost weight as the result of pressure from appearing on TV programs or radio programs, and from pressure of composing music.
Kawamoto released her 2nd single "DNA", for which she wrote words and music herself, and her 3rd single "1/2" which were tied to popular anime Rurouni Kenshin, and her first album Kawamoto Makoto.
However, she encountered problems when she found it difficult to write songs after that, and she occasionally confined herself in a hotel.
She did not agree with the record label's plan for her activities, due to pressure, she got out of shape and went home temporarily.
Although she thought she might retire as a musician, she was retained by Sony for two more years, and she returned to Tokyo.
However, she came to devote herself to live performances without releasing a new song after she released the single "Blossom" in 2001.
She came to find pleasure in her work and began to think that she might continue it for a while.
However, after talking it over, she decided not to renew the contract with Sony.
In October 2002, she left.
In April 2003, her contract with Antinos Records expired and she became a freelancer.


=== Independent music ===
In 2005, Kawamoto sang the commercial song of Kanebo "ALLIE", which was Maria Anzai's cover song "Namida no Taiyō (涙の太陽, Sun of tears)."
However, it is not released at present.
In 2005, Kawamoto formed "MihoMihoMakoto" with Miho Asahi and Miho Moribayashi, and they performed in the concerts.
On January 25, 2006, Kawamoto announced that she finished music activity with "Makoto Kawamoto" name in her homepage.
On April 24, 2006, Kawamoto announced that she changed her name to "Tiger Fake Fur" with her blog.
When she appeared on the live by request of her acquaintance before, it was difficult for her to use the name of "Makoto Kawamoto." Under such a circumstance, she could not but use the alias.
She introduced herself as "Tiger Carpet" at first, but she said that she felt sorry for a dead tiger, and renamed it to "Tiger Fake Fur."
On July 5, 2006, Kawamoto released a CD as time-limited group of 3 chorus unit "MihoMihoMakoto" after an interval of five years, and she resumed musical activities completely.
On August 9, 2006, Kawamoto released new 1st single "Yagi-ō no Theme" in the "Tiger Fake Fur" name from HMJM(hamajim) Records.
Recently Kawamoto gives a concert in Tokyo and her hometown, Fukui wherever her feet led her, and she enjoys it.
In 2009, Kawamoto sang "Hontou no Hanashi" in documentary film "An'nyon Yumika".
It is announced that Kawamoto will release her 3rd solo album "Ongaku no Sekai e Youkoso (音楽の世界へようこそ, Welcome to the musical world)" which she produces for herself on February 19, 2010.
