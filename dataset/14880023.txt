Julie von Webenau (16 October 1813 – 2 July 1887) was a German-Austrian composer.  


== Life ==
Julie was a daughter of the government council member Ludwig Cajetan Baroni-Cavalcabò (1765-1847) and the amateur singer Josephine Baroni-Cavalcabò (1788-1860). She had a sister Laura. In Lemberg she was a student of Mozart's son Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart . Her mother Josephine Baroni-Cavalcabò became his lover and sole heir. She also had a brother, Adolf Baroni-Cavalcabò (1809–1847).
Robert Schumann dedicated his Humoresque op. 20 to Julie in 1839. He had already met her in Leipzig in 1835 and renewed his acquaintance in Vienna. Originally he wanted to dedicate the Arabesque op. 18 to her. On March 13, 1839, he wrote about it to his bride Clara Wieck: “The 'arabesque' was given to the Webenau, the 'flower piece' to the Serre, the 'humoresque' - nobody; Strange, I also think of something in my dedications, which should always have a connection with the origin, and could not find anyone, but the world hardly understands the subtleties. " 
Julie von Webenau dedicated the composition L'Adieu et le Retour to Schumann . Morceaux de Fantaisie pour Pianoforte op. 25, which was published in March 1840 by the Leipzig publishing house Kistner.  According to a review by Schumann in his Neue Zeitschrift für Musik from 1836/37, the names of all female composers could easily be written on a "rose leaf". That had to do with the social ostracism of the artistically creative woman and her gender role in general.


== Family ==
On March 29, 1838, in Lemberg, she married the lawyer Wilhelm Weber Edler von Webenau (1796–1841), a member of the legislative court commission in Vienna , with whom she moved to Vienna that same year. Her son was the imperial and royal embassy counselor in Constantinople Arthur Weber Edler von Webenau. Her husband died on August 16, 1841. 
In July 1842 she married the Brazilian Legation Secretary Dr. Johann Alois Ritter by Britto. The couple had two sons and one daughter. In 1877 her second husband died and Julie lived with her sister Laura Pawlikowska until her death.
Laura Pawlikowska, née Countess Baroni-Cavalcabò (1810-1892), was the wife of the art collector Johann Gualbert Ritter von Pawlikowsky (1792-1852).
Her granddaughter was the composer Vilma von Webenau .
