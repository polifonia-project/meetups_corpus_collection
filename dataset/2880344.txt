Jonas Petter Renkse (born 19 May 1975) is a Swedish musician in the bands Katatonia(1991–) as lead vocalist, founder, songwriter (1991–1994, 1997–) and formerly as drummer (1991–1994, 1996–1998); in Bloodbath(1998–) as bassist, founder, songwriter; and in Wisdom of Crowds (2013–) as co-vocalist.
He was also the founding member, drummer, vocalist, guitarist & songwriter of the band October Tide.


== History ==
In 1995 Katatonia was put on a halt due to not having a suitable lineup, and Renkse subsequently decided to form October Tide.
In 1996, Jonas' performance of death vocals had taken such a toll that by 1997 he would only sing cleanly. By 1998, Renkse decided he would focus strictly on vocals and abandon drums.
Renkse wanted to guest on The Ocean's album, Precambrian but due to Katatonia's touring schedule during the production, The Ocean was not able to approach him on time. He would later appear on the track "Devonian: Nascent" off of their 2018 release Phanerozoic I: Paleozoic, as well as "Jurassic | Cretaceous" from the 2020 release Phanerozoic II: Mesozoic & Cenozoic.


== Personal life ==
Renkse has three children, and is best friends with singer Mikael Åkerfeldt of the band Opeth. Åkerfeldt recorded part of the Blackwater Park album at Renkse's house.
