Kai Gullmar (pseudonym for Gurli Maria Bergström), (2 April 1905 in Sundsvall – 25 March 1982 in Stockholm), was a Swedish composer, musician, singer and actress. Gullmar wrote music for more than 40 films between 1937 and 1960.


== Biography ==
In 1924–1925, Gullmar studied in London. After her return to Sweden, she settled in Stockholm; she made her debut as a performer in a revue by Ernst Rolf in 1929. However, Gullmar's parents forbade her from performing on stage, and she started working as a recording artist and composer for HMV instead.
Gullmar soon emerged as one of Sweden's leading composers of schlager music, with entertainers such as Ulla Billquist, Karin Juel, Harry Brandelius and Karl Gerhard recording her compositions. During her career, Gullmar wrote music for more than 47 Swedish films. Simultaneously, she continued recording her own music and acting in revues as well as films.
Kai Gullmar was openly lesbian and became known for her often androgynous way of dressing. She is buried at Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.
