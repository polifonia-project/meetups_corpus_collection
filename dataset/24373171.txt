== Early life and career ==
Growing up in Lubbock, Texas, Travis Garland was exposed to the arts at a very young age. He started off singing and acting in plays at his church and went on to attend the School For The Performing Arts in junior high where he received extensive training in music and theater. After winning a nationwide acting competition at the age of 14, Garland relocated to Los Angeles, California where he signed with a manager and agent. He began going on auditions during the day but spent his nights developing his song-writing, and after a chance meeting with a friend from Dallas he was asked to join the pop/R&B group Not Like Them (NLT).
A few years later, NLT was signed to a major label deal working under the direction of Geffen Records Chairman Ron Fair. With Garland as the frontman and one of two lead singers, NLT was put in the studio to collaborate with top producers and songwriters including Pharrell, Ne-Yo and Ryan Tedder. The group opened on tour for The Pussycat Dolls and gained a small, but loyal, fan following. In 2007 NLT released their Timbaland-produced single "She Said, I Said (Time We Let Go)" and scored their first Top 40 Hit. They continued to tour, and caused a female fan girl frenzy headlining a national House of Blues tour aptly titled "The 2009 Bandemonium Tour" along with V Factory and Menudo. When the group eventually parted ways to pursue individual opportunities Garland shifted his focus back to songwriting, only this time for a solo album.
Garland was represented by JT Entertainment in 2010 according to his Myspace page. In fact, it was through Myspace that Garland was introduced to Perez Hilton. Hilton "was instantly blown away". Songs written or demoed by Garland can be viewed on YouTube, including ""Can't Believe it" (featuring Kevin McHale and RAS), and many more. Garland also covered Beyonc√©'s "Sweet Dreams", T.I. & Justin Timberlake's "Dead and Gone", and also P!nk's "Fuckin' Perfect". Garland wrote & demoed a song titled "Sexy Together", but passed on it; the song was eventually modified by its producers and was then sold to Justin Bieber under the title of "Never Say Never".
