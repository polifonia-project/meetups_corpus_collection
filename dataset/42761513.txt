=== 2012: MC Beyoncé ===

Ludmilla began posting videos on YouTube singing, which achieved many views. Until one day she was asked to sing and rap by a DJ at a party. She performed and everyone loved it.
Ludmilla's music career took off after her breakout hit single "Fala Mal de Mim" (released as MC Beyoncé) posted on YouTube went viral. The song was first posted in May 2012 and it has since accumulated more than 17 million views. The official music video was posted in October of the same year and has since accumulated more than 15 million views.The song was produced by DJ Will 22 and the song's introduction includes a sample of the gospel classic "Oh Happy Day" covered by the St. Francis Choir in the film Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. Since her rise to fame, she has been touring around Brazil and has made numerous appearances on popular television shows. In an interview with SBT's TV show Domingo Legal, Ludmilla revealed that her former stage name was given to her by her friends because she was such a huge Beyoncé fan.


=== 2013: Name change ===
In 2013, Ludmilla said she was threatened by her businessman. The singer recorded a video saying:

Hi, guys, I'm not here to give good news. My dream was always to have a band, dancers, everything. Only I found that I was being too stolen by my manager. So I did not want in my whole life, stay in that sameness, I wanted band, dancers, being an artist himself. And he never wanted to invest in me. When I try to walk with my own legs, he began to make threatenings my family, my mother, myself to death. Ending my dream. So I wanted to tell you guys that I'm no longer singing, the MC Beyoncé is over.
Then the singer recorded another video, saying the previous video was a misunderstanding and that she would continue her career. However, the disagreement between her and her manager, Roba Cena, resulted in MC Beyoncé being unable to keep her name as MC Beyoncé because her manager owned the rights to the name. Hours later she recanted and announced on Twitter that she would not quit singing, but she would quit with her manager and start a new career under a new stage name, Ludmilla, her birth name.However, it is likely the name change was due to potential litigations from the more internationally known singer Beyoncé.
