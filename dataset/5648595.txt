With the help of producer Maurice Starr in 1990, she recorded her second album Body Language, which includes the duet "Angel of Love" with New Kids on the Block's Jordan Knight. Debbie Gibson also wrote two songs in the album: "Everytime We Say Goodbye" and "Friendly". The album's only single "Got to Tell Me Something" peaked at No. 66 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rodriguez performed "Everytime We Say Goodbye" at the 19th Tokyo Music Festival that year.After years of absence, Rodríguez re-emerged under the name of Mía and released an all-Spanish language album entitled Tentación on Univision Records in September 2003. The album garnered her a Best New Artist of the Year nomination at the Premio Lo Nuestro 2004.
