== First Lady of Chiapas ==
On April 25, 2015, Anahí married Manuel Velasco Coello, the Governor of Chiapas, elected in December 2012.

She was widely criticized on social media for wearing a dress costing the state 120,000 Mexican pesos (US$7572, equivalent to $8,267 in 2020) during the 2015 celebrations of the Cry of Dolores in Chiapas. Many of the criticisms focused on the fact that Chiapas is the poorest State in the Union.


== Personal life ==
During the filming of Primer Amor, Anahí battled a serious eating disorder, anorexia. She weighed approximately 75 pounds (34 kg) at her lowest weight. She spent time in five different treatment centers, and visited doctors and psychologists across the country. One day after returning from a family vacation, she began to feel faint, and was rushed to a hospital, where her heart stopped for eight seconds. She has since recovered and become a vocal spokesperson against eating disorders in Mexico. In 2008, with the support of Televisa, Anahí launched a campaign against anorexia and bulimia.In 2006, the tax administration of Mexico froze four of Anahí's bank accounts as a preventive measure because she was under investigation for tax fraud.

In 2007, a Barbie doll version of Anahí, Dulce Maria, and Maite Perroni were released, based on their characters in Rebelde. People en Español named her one of their "50 Most Beautiful" in 2010.On March 11, 2011, doctors discovered that Anahí's brain was being deprived of a large percentage of oxygen due to a deviated septum.  It was determined that this was the main cause of several ailments that had plagued Anahí, including a heart attack. She underwent a successful operation.On March 23, 2011, Anahí became the spokeswoman for Snickers in Latin America. The advertising campaign that was launched sparked controversy, with National Council to Prevent Discrimination and the National Institute of Women deeming the commercial sexist and filing complaints. Anahí defended the campaign, saying that the commercial wasn't intended to offend anyone. Effem Mexico, the company behind Snickers, disagreed with the sexism complaints. However, before the advertisement aired, they conducted a survey among women, asking their opinions on the content. According to Effem, the majority of the women surveyed did not feel the advertisement was discriminatory.

On September 18, 2011, National Geographic aired the original production of "Obsession: Bodies That Scream", filmed in Latin America, which featured the testimonies of people who suffer from body dysmorphia and eating disorders. Anahí spoke about the five-year period in which she suffered from anorexia, and her recovery.  On October 12, 2011, Anahí joined the Non-Violence Project's campaign, "Imagine One Billion Faces For Peace", as a Global Ambassador. The campaign's ambassadors include public figures such as Paul McCartney, Yoko Ono, and Ringo Starr. The campaign aims to honor the legacy of the late John Lennon by calling for peace and non-violence worldwide.
During the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Anahí, alongside other Global Ambassadors, performed in an event for The Non-Violence Project presented by Yoko Ono. Maxim named her as one of the Maxim Hot 100 of 2012, calling her a "Mexican beauty" who represents "a true triple threat: she sings, she acts, and writes hilarious tweets".On July 16, 2013, a nail polish line by Anahí titled "BE by Anahí" was released. The line is a collection of 25 different colors, with names relating to her music like "rebelde", "delirio", "absurda", "click", "hipnótico" and "Sálvame".In April 2012, Anahí began dating the governor of Chiapas, Manuel Velasco Coello. They became engaged in October 2014 and married on April 25, 2015, in a private religious ceremony held in San Cristóbal de las Casas.
