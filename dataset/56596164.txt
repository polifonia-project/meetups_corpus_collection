The band embarked on a 2-year international tour to support the album, touring mostly through the US, Brazil and Argentina.Between 2016 and 2018, while still touring to support Supreme Blue Dream, Winter released several singles with accompanying music videos, including "All the Things You Do", "Jaded" and "Dreaming".

=== Samira's Infinite Summer ===
While working with the Winter band, Samira also gave birth to a solo project entitled "Samira's Infinite Summer" in mid-2015. All of the demos for the project were recorded on Samira's bedroom and posted on Samira's Infinite Summer's Bandcamp page. A studio-recorded single, "Caf√©", was released in December 2016 and promoted mainly through the Brazilian press, since its lyrics were written in Portuguese. However, the project's Facebook and Bandcamp pages were deactivated in 2017.
