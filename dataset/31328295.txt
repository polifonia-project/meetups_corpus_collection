== Producer career ==
Isak Rypdal came to prominence in 1999 after singing Doctor No to Warner Music Norway. 
The singles Lastima and La Luna written together with bandmember Bendik Gjevjon gained high rotation on nearly all Norwegian radio stations including NRK P3 for over a year. The singles also reached high on Norway’s official sales chart, and for nearly two years Doctor No toured Norway with over 80 performances including playing for over 50.000 people at VG Lista Topp 20's show at Rådhusplassen, Oslo.With the following single All For You and the album Fat Sound To The Masses, Doctor No signs a new deal with Warner Music Japan, and many other territories follows up the releases in 2001. In 2002 Isak started the new project Disco Valente released on Nice & Firm/Bonnier Music Norway. Two 8-track maxi singles were released and the debut single I See Music peaked on the official Scandinavian Dance Chart.
In 2004 Isak teams up with the Norwegian singer Hanne Romsaas and releases Freeloader - Pure Devotion on EMI Publishing Germany. The single was picked up by top DJ's such as Judge Jules who put the song on his top ten list on the BBC Radio One show. The single is compiled in excess of 750,000 units and was also included on all Samsung mobile phones in the years after. Isak Rypdal is currently working with the band Electro Spectre, and the current album Dangerous Game was suggested as the best electro pop album for 2012 by Side-Line Magazine.
