William Wells (June 10, 1907 – November 12, 1985), known professionally as Dicky Wells (sometimes Dickie Wells), was an American jazz trombonist.


== Career ==
Dickie Wells is believed to have been born on June 10, 1907 in Centerville, Tennessee, United States. His brother was trombonist Henry Wells. He moved to New York City in 1926, and became a member of the Lloyd Scott band.He played with Count Basie between 1938–1945 and 1947–1950. He also played with Cecil Scott, Spike Hughes, Fletcher Henderson, Benny Carter, Teddy Hill, Jimmy Rushing, Buck Clayton and Ray Charles.  In the middle years of the 1960s, Wells toured and performed extensively, and the onset of alcoholism caused him  personal problems which led to his semi-retirement.  Publication of his autobiography in 1973 helped to steer Wells back to his profession.

In his later years, Wells suffered a severe beating during a mugging that affected his memory, but he recovered and continued to perform. He played frequently at the West End jazz club at 116th and Broadway, most often with a band called The Countsmen, led by alto saxophonist Earle Warren, his colleague from Count Basie days. A trademark was Wells's "pepper pot" mute which he made himself.


== Death ==

He died of cancer on November 12, 1985, in New York City. Shortly after his death, Wells's family donated his trombone to the Rutgers University Institute of Jazz Studies.
