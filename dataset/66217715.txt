Benjamin David Goldberg (born September 24, 1998), known professionally as Token, is an American rapper and songwriter from Boston, Massachusetts.


== Early life ==
Ben Goldberg was born and raised in Marblehead, Massachusetts. He was introduced to hip hop music at age six by his older sister. His mother, Leslie Goldberg, described him as having incidents of "explosive anger". In his younger years, Goldberg was being suspended from school for yelling at his teachers and fighting. Goldberg was eventually diagnosed with depression and anxiety. He had difficulty in understanding expressive language, and was diagnosed with language disability as well. As a child, Goldberg also suffered from obesity, weighing 140 pounds by the time of fourth grade. He began running on the treadmill after school and lost 50 pounds halfway through fifth grade.At a young age, Goldberg had a dream of becoming a rapper; a psychiatrist noted that it seemed to be the only thing on his mind. An outlet for Goldberg was writing poetry in his diary. He began rhyming and writing rap songs at 10 years old. According to Goldberg, the three main artists he listened to were 2Pac, Eminem and Ludacris.

=== 2012–2014: Career Beginnings ===
Goldberg first began rapping under the name BDG (his initials). He began uploading his music on YouTube; his first song was a freestyle to "Drop the World" by Lil Wayne featuring Eminem. The students at his school reacted negatively toward his music, but he began building a fanbase online. In the sixth grade, Goldberg started collaborating with his friend Colin Mitchell, a local rapper known as C-Mitch. Their first project was Lethal Combination. Although the reception from the public was generally negative as well, one of their CDs ended up in the possession of producer Jon Glass, who saw their potential and became a mentor to them.
Goldberg later adopted the stage name "Token", which came out of feeling different from other rappers as a Jewish white kid from Boston, and started uploading his music videos through YouTube when he was 14. He released his debut mixtape, The Mindstate, in February 2014.

In April 2016, he appeared on the radio show Sway in the Morning, on which he freestyled to Lil Wayne's "Believe Me" and brought co-host Tracy G to tears as a result. The video of his freestyle went viral, gaining him further recognition. Token performed a free hip hop show presented by Wahlberg in May 2016, which was filmed for Wahlberg's reality TV show Wahlburgers.
