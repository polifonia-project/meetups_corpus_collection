Kiyoharu Mori (森 清治, Mori Kiyoharu, born 30 October 1968), better known by his stage name Kiyoharu (清春). is a Japanese musician and singer-songwriter, known for his work with Kuroyume and Sads. In 2003, he began his solo career, performing as both a singer and guitarist.


== Music career ==


=== Independent career and Kuroyume (1986–1999) ===
Kiyoharu's musical career began in 1986 as a member of the independent band Double Bed, which folded after a few months of activity. He then formed Sus4 in 1987, before later joining Garnet. After the disbandment of Garnet in 1991, Kiyoharu, as well as former Garnet bassist, Hitoki, formed Kuroyume. Kuroyume began in the beginning days of the visual kei movement. They progressed from a typical dark image and sound, to a heavy sound influenced by punk rock. The band ended as only a duo with Kiyoharu and Hitoki remaining. After tension on how the band should be managed and health problems for Hitoki, the duo ended the band in 1999.


=== Sads and Fullface establishment (1999–2003) ===
Kiyoharu picked up again with his musical career, forming Sads in 1999. Sads produced a post-punk sound with a heavy surf rock influence. The band eventually formed their own record label, Fullface Records, in 2001, releasing their own material on the label. The label would sign its first act outside Sads, Merry, for their first album Gendai Stoic.
Sads' drummer, Eiji Mitsuzono announced his departure from the band in 2003, leaving the band on an indefinite hiatus.


=== Solo career (2004–present) ===
After the pause in Sads' activities in 2003, Kiyoharu began releasing solo work. His debut album, Poetry, was released in 2004, showcasing not only his vocal skills, but his talent as a guitarist as well. He has collaborated with many artists, including Hyde (L'Arc-en-Ciel), Takanori Nishikawa (T.M. Revolution), Kirito (Pierrot), Atsushi Sakurai (Buck-Tick), Gara (Merry), Sugizo (Luna Sea) etc.
In 2006, Kiyoharu released two singles, as well as a new album, Vinnybeach -Kakuu no Kaigan-, followed by two long, promotional tours. The following single, "Slow", was featured as the opening song for the anime series The Wallflower.
He released another studio album, Forever Love, in 2007. It is dedicated to his father, who died. Kiyoharu released "Aibu" in early 2008, and in May the next single, Samidare, was released.
In 2008, he released a set of twin albums entitled Rhythmless & Perspective light~saw the light & shade and Rhythmless & Perspective shade~saw the light & shade. Each album contained 7 tracks of self-covers from his solo work and his work with Sads. The following year, he released the album Medley, a collection of Kuroyume covers.
On July 11, 2012, he released Under the Sun.He covered "Sadistic Emotion" by D'erlanger for 2017's D'erlanger Tribute Album ~Stairway to Heaven~.In 2017, Kiyoharu participated in Sugizo's solo studio album, Oneness M, on the track "Voice".Kiyoharu released his tenth studio album, Japanese Menu/Distortion 10, on March 25, 2020.
