Garolou is a Canadian progressive and folk-rock group. Formed in 1975 by French Canadians from Ontario and Quebec, the band was originally called Lougarou, but had to change its name after being sued by a dance troupe named Les Loups-garous. The group became popular not only in Quebec but across Canada, with its rock sound and its lyrics taken from French and French Canadian traditional songs.
In 1993 the band made a return supported by many concerts each year. The band performed at many music festivals such as the Festival International d'été de Québec and the Festival franco-ontarien. The band released in 1997 a live album called Réunion that captured Garolou's live experience and, two years later, a brand new album called Mémoire Vive.
Garolou has won two Félix Awards (ADISQ Gala) for the albums Garolou (1978) and Romancero (1980) and a Gold certification for the album Garolou (1978).
