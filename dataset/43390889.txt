=== 2009-2011: Formation ===
In 2009, Lauren Flax and Lauren Dillard formed CREEP after having been in projects together before. They initially signed up to the record label, Young Turks. Before the release of "Days" (featuring Romy XX), they started their own label, 'CREEP INTL.'. In January 2011, their second single "You", featuring Nina Sky, was released. On January 26, 2011, the music video for the song "Days" was released on Young Turks' official YouTube account. On May 15, 2011, the music video for "You" was released on the duo's official website. Late in the year, Flax revealed she was openly lesbian and CREEP continued with recording of their first album.


=== 2012-present: Echoes ===
In December 2011, "Animals" was released along with its music video. It was released as an official single on January 17, 2012. The song features vocals from Holly Miranda. In 2013, they released three singles from their debut album: "Call Her" (featuring Tricky and Alejandra De La Deheza of School of Seven Bells, "Vertigo" (featuring Lou Rhodes of Lamb) and "Dim the Lights" (featuring Sia). The album, Echoes was initially announced for an August 2013 release. It was eventually released worldwide on November 12. The album debuted at number eight on the iTunes Electronic Chart. Commenting on the album, Flax said: "It's amazing how it came together. It really was an organic process, which is truly important to us. The majority of the people on our record are friends, it really all came together perfectly." Dillard adds: "It took a while to finish since we had so many guest vocalists, but we're honored to have worked with so many talented artists." Flax also said: "We wrote it and produced it, so the final mixes had to be everything it could be. We wanted Chris Coady to mix our record, he had just finished Beach House, Zola Jesus, and Santigold and we loved the sound of those records. We had to wait for him and it was worth it". Echoes combines house, trip hop, electronic, and gospel elements in some songs.
