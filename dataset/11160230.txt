Steve Karmen (born January 31, 1937) is an American composer, most famous for several jingles. Among his better known works are the New York State song, "I Love New York", the jingle Here Comes the King for Budweiser, the Hershey's chocolate jingle The Great American Chocolate Bar, the Exxon Song Energy for a Strong America (1976), and Wrigley Spearmint Gum / Carry The Big Fresh Flavor (1973). He also composed several music scores for motion pictures including the Mamie Van Doren film The Candidate (1964), Teenage Mother (1967) and What Do You Say to a Naked Lady? (1970), and performed briefly as a Calypso singer, achieving some recognition in Trinidad during that time.  Karmen is the recipient of 16 Clio Awards.


== Life and career ==
Karmen was born in the Bronx, New York. Steve was unique among jingle writers. Unlike other composers, who were paid a flat price for their jingles, Steve was the only one of his peers to receive royalties every time one of his jingles was performed on TV or Radio. His informal industry title "The King of Jingles" may have been given to him because of this extraordinary business ability to retain publishing rights.
He was born into a conservative family. His father was from Russia. Karmen grew up with Bobby Darin, and played with him in a band in the 1950s. They met while they were at the Bronx High School of Science. He played saxophone and guitar.His wife died of colon cancer in 1973.  He is the father of three daughters.
As of 2007, he lives in Westchester, New York.
