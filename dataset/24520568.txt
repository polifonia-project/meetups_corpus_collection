Elena Emilevna Gilels (Russian: Елена Эмильевна Ги́лельс; September 5, 1948 – June 17, 1996) was a Russian pianist.
The daughter of pianist Emil Gilels, Elena Gilels studied at the Moscow Conservatory under Vera Gornostayeva and Yakov Flier, then with Pavel Serebryakov at the Leningrad Conservatory. Her repertoire focused on the works of Haydn, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Liszt, Schumann, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev. Elena Gilels is perhaps best remembered for her performances of Mozart's piano concertos. She frequently performed with her father Emil Gilels, with whom she recorded Mozart's Concerto for Two Pianos, KV. 365.
