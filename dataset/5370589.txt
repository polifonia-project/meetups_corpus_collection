== Biography ==


=== L'Arc-en-Ciel ===
Two months before his graduation in 1992, Ken left the Nagoya Institute of Technology, where he was an architect major, to join L'Arc-en-Ciel at the request of his childhood friend Tetsuya. He has written a breadth of L'Arc-en-Ciel's music ever since his joining, including "As if in a Dream", "Vivid Colors", "Niji", "The Fourth Avenue Cafe", "Shout at the Devil", "Kasou", "Lies and Truth", "Lover Boy", "My Heart Draws a Dream", "Lost Heaven", "Daybreak's Bell" and "Twinkle Twinkle".


=== Sons of All Pussys ===
In 2002 Ken formed his own band, Sons of All Pussys (S.O.A.P.), as a result of a break in L'Arc-en-Ciel's activities, with ex-L'Arc-en-Ciel member Yasunori "Sakura" Sakurazawa as drummer, and Ein as bassist (a half Japanese/German model who appeared in a few L'Arc PVs). Each member contributed songs based on themes; Ken with love, Ein with desire, and Sakura with his experiences in jail, and together they released three albums; Grace, Gimme A Guitar, High! and one single, "Paradise". All S.O.A.P. activities have ceased since 2004.


=== Solo career ===
On August 23, 2006, Ken released a solo single titled "Speed", and has taken a new "clean" appearance similar to his early days with L'Arc-en-Ciel. In 2008, he began releasing more singles, including "Deeper" and "S", leading up to the eventual release of his first solo album, In Physical, in 2009.


== Guitars ==
Ken is currently an endorser for Fernandes Guitars and is usually seen playing these guitars live with L'Arc-en-Ciel. However he tends to modify his models instead of using them stock. For instance, in the past he used to use Van Zandt pick-ups heavily in his own personal guitars and has since moved on to Kinman pick-ups (this change having now been reflected in one of his more recent Fernandes signature models).
However he has also used many different guitars in and out of L'Arc-en-Ciel, including Gibson, Fender, and Steinberger models.
In 2010, he endorsed the American-based guitar brand Fender, Ken (together with Inoran from Luna Sea) was approached by Fender and signed the endorsement contract; his signature model is a Stratocaster.
