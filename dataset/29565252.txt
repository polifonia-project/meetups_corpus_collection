Julia Mary Deans (born 27 August 1974) is a New Zealand singer-songwriter best known as the lead singer of rock band Fur Patrol.

In the early '90s Deans joined Wellington-based Celtic rock band Banshee Reel. The group released two albums – Culture Vulture (1993) and An Orchestrated Litany of Lies (1995). Banshee Reel toured extensively around New Zealand and overseas. In 1996, after returning to New Zealand from a Canadian tour, Deans and Wellington guitarist Steve Wells decided to form a rock group, which was to become Fur Patrol.

Fur Patrol released three albums – Pet (2000), Collider (2003) and Local Kid (2008) and had a number one single with "Lydia" in 2000. The band moved to Melbourne in 2001 to focus on a wider Australian audience. After the lack of success with their third album Local Kid, Fur Patrol went on hiatus.

With a number of songs she had written over the years but thought unsuitable for Fur Patrol, Deans was encouraged by her record company to record a solo album. This became Modern Fables, released in 2010. It was well received and was short-listed for the Taite Music Prize, with single "A New Dialogue" long-listed for the APRA Silver Scroll award.Deans then became part of The Adults, a musical collaboration between established New Zealand musicians such as Jon Toogood, Shayne Carter, Tiki Taane and Ladi6. In 2011 the group released a self-titled album which was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2012 New Zealand Music Awards.In 2012, Deans released new single "Broken Home". She also embarked on a theatrical project, starring with Jon Toogood in Silo Theatre's production of Brel: The Words and Music of Jacques Brel.In 2013, Deans performed at the Taite Music Prize ceremony in April. Later in the year, Deans and Anika Moa recorded a cover version of "2000 Miles" for the charity album Starship Christmas Album 2013.
