The marching bands under his direction were known for innovative and colorful halftime shows.  Since the mid-1940s, the College of Music had been, and still is, among the nation's largest music schools.  Due to the size of the music school, his marching bands were filled with an unusual number of music majors, sometimes exceeding 90%.
