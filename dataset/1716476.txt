As an actor, he has appeared on television, in British series including The Avengers, Man in a Suitcase, Jonathan Creek and The Bill.

His film credits include a starring role in the 1963 film A Place to Go with Rita Tushingham, directed by Basil Dearden, and he also appeared in Invasion Quartet (1961), Every Day's a Holiday (1965), Two Weeks in September (1967), Moonlighting (1982) and Success Is the Best Revenge (1984) for Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski and the Hercule Poirot film Appointment with Death (1988).

Films he has directed include Joanna (1968) and Myra Breckinridge (1970), an adaptation of Gore Vidal's book of the same name, starring Raquel Welch, Rex Reed, Mae West, with Farrah Fawcett and Tom Selleck in roles early in their careers. Joanna broke even at the box office, but Myra Breckinridge was a major box-office flop and drew such critical hostility that his career never recovered. A more recent film is The Punk and the Princess (1994), an adaptation of Gideon Sams' young adult novel The Punk, about the romance between a teenage punk rocker and a Sloane Ranger girl. He also directed a documentary about the Glastonbury Music Festival in 1995.

He has five children – two from his 1969–1978 marriage to Tanya Sarne, founder of the designer label Ghost; and three with second wife Anne Musso, whom he married in 2004 in Chelsea, London.Sarne had an affair with Geneviève Waïte, while directing her in his 1968 film Joanna. He was physically violent towards her during filming; in a 1968 interview with New York Magazine he said of hitting Waïte that it was "the only way to direct this girl, otherwise she's very cheeky. She has to be shown. I mean she knew that unless she behaved herself she'd get slapped down. One is polite to girls so long as they behave themselves" and that he "didn't punch her around as corrective punishment. Only when she annoyed me".
