The label's debut release was Living Creatures by Stolas, on March 14, 2013. The label is prominently known for signing the rock bands Hail the Sun, Icarus the Owl and Stolas.


== Influence and musical style ==
Will Swan has listed several musical artists and groups that influenced his musicianship throughout his career. He has cited The Mars Volta, Temptations, Deftones, Earth, Wind & Fire, and Glassjaw, among others as inspirations. Throughout the recording process of Dance Gavin Dance's third studio album, Happiness (2009), Swan debuted his unclean vocal prowess after the band's primary screaming vocalist Jon Mess parted ways with the band in 2008, however since Mess rejoined in 2010, Swan now only pursues screaming vocals during live performances, most prominently in songs from the album Happiness.
Swan has also been known to experiment with rap and hip hop in Dance Gavin Dance's music. He first made a rap appearance in the song "Powder to the People", the final track on the album Happiness. He has since rapped occasionally on every album since, except for the band's eighth studio album Artificial Selection (2018). In an interview with Substream Magazine, Swan spoke about his rap influences after being asked about his rap verse in the song "Eagle Vs. Crows", from the album Instant Gratification (2015), stating:

It literally came out of nowhere. I started on Happiness with a rap kind of inspired by TV on the Radio. Then after I proved that it would sound cool, it became something that would pop up here and there on the records. We never really plan for a rap going into the studio. There will just be a part where I feel a rap would fit best. I write it, show it to everyone and then record.
As far as his musical style, Swan has incorporated elements of math rock, progressive rock, post-hardcore, experimental rock, Avant-garde music, funk, and jazz-fusion into all of his musical projects, most eminently in Dance Gavin Dance.
