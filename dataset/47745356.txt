==== Gol-e Yakh ====

The song "Gol-e Yakh" was written by Mahdi Akhavan Langeroudi who was Yaghmaei's friend at the university and one of the significant modern Persian poets. "Gol-e Yakh" penetrated beyond the borders of Iran, and thereafter various performances in other countries of the world continued till this day. The song brought a great fame to Yaghmaei and it was adapted for various languages.

He released 4 singles from his contracted record company Ahange Rooz. In 1973 "Gole Yakh" / "Del Dareh Pir Misheh" and "Leila" / "Paiz", in 1974 "Hajme Khali" / "Akhm Nakon" and in 1975 "Saraabe Toe" / "Dar Enteha" was released.

==== Islamic Revolution ====
Yaghmaei performed on radio or television in Iran till 1970s. During the Islamic Revolution of 1979, Islamic government cracked down hard on his music. Kourosh was no longer allowed to sing and perform publicly. This ban on Kourosh's performances would affect his career. Aside from a few concerts in Sweden and Norway in 1993, he did not perform much outside the country. The authorities swiftly shut down his music and barred from releasing records and performing live. Following the revolution, Yaghmaei spent over a month for recording albums Sol-e 1 (1979)- reissued on CD as Parandeye Mohajer by Los Angeles-based record label Caltex Records, Sol-e 2 (1980, recorded with Fereydoon Forooghi) and Sol-e 3, which was renamed to Arayesh-E Khorshid during its release in 2000, because during that time this album was about to be released the regime's pressure on music became more unbearable than ever. According to Kevan Harris, a lecturer from the University of California, the government after the Islamic revolution were too much motivated to stop the impacts of Western and European culture; therefore it was convinced to diminish musicians like Kourosh. Several musicians immigrated to cities like Los Angeles, Montreal, Paris and other European countries where exile communities were settled. Yaghmaei preferred to stay in Iran for his principles. Where he stated that:


=== Post revolution ===
Since the Islamic Revolution, Yaghmaei was forbidden for seventeen years. During this time he worked for the children and published books and cassettes. In 1987, he released his fourth solo instrumental Diar with a restriction of Iranian Government not to using bass, guitar and drums during the recording session. However, there were folkloric pieces arranged by Yaghmaei to be played by the Great National Orchestra.


=== 1990s‚Äìpresent ===
In the early 1990s, Yaghmaei got permission from the Iranian government to release albums under some restrictions. He released studio album Gorg haye Ghorosneh in 1990. Caltex Records titled his "best of the 1970s" as "Gole Yakh" released in 1991. During 1993, the restrictions became looser and Kourosh got permission to perform concerts in Norway and Sweden. In 1994 he released studio album Sib-e Noghreii (The Silver Apple), in which the regime didn't let him publish his portrait as an artwork, therefore album cover was only graphic arts. In 1996 Mah va Palang and in 1997 Kabous was released.
In the early 2000s, he released two solo albums Arayesh-E Khorshid (2000), which primarily recorded as Sol-e 3 was censored one track before released and Tofang-e daste Noghre (2001), was the last album that legally published in Iran.


==== Malek Jamshid ====

Between 2003 and 2006, Yaghmaei worked with his last studio album titled Malek Jamshid. After 12 years of trying to obtain the required permit from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, the authority denied to release this album in Iran. Latter in 2016, since two years of restriction not to use types of equipment such as acoustic system, sound engineering, professional microphones, amplifiers, Roland keyboard, electric guitar, 8 track recorder and other necessary equipment the album was released by Now-Again in United States and the album was banned by the Iranian government.He released debut compilation Back from the Brink: Pre-Revolution Psychedelic Rock from Iran: 1973‚Äì1979 in 2011. A two-disc celebration of Yaghmaei's most well-known numbers, recorded between 1973 and 1979, before the Islamic Revolution.


== Musical style ==

Yaghmaei has unique Iranian style of psychedelic rock and blues-rock music. He brought a lot of innovation to Iranian rock, using the keyboard as the rhythm of the song instead of the guitar is part of this innovation. Such as describing a melancholic picture, blues riffs, strings and analog synthesizer sounds make a feeling that settles in the heart. As the songs last for 6 to 8 minutes approximately, many progressive movements could easily be a part of the music. According to Iranian writer Ebrahim Nabavi, "Yaghmaei has had a profound impact on Psychedelic rock in Iran." Yaghmaei is known as the father of Iranian rock music because of his deep influence on Iranian rock music. "He was one of the people who was doing the Western-Eastern kind of hybrid music the right way," says Ashkan Kooshanejad, a British-Iranian composer.


== Personal life ==
Yaghmaei has two sons, Kaveh Yaghmaei, also a musician that lives in Vancouver, Canada; and Kamil Yaghmaei. He has a daughter named Satgin Yaghmaei. Due to his records being under heavy censorship in Iran, Kourosh now runs a private music school and studio in Tehran.
