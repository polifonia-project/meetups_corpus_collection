While Ng's takedown notice of the YouTube clips of the music video succeeded, Spinnin' Records continued to use images from Ng's video on their website and publicity material. Ng is exploring legal options against Spinnin' Records. Sparks claimed he had no knowledge of the alleged copyright, as he only produced the music for the accompanying video.
