== Career ==
Rivera initially wanted to be a restaurateur. However, his father, Pedro Rivera, was a recording label/studio owner (Cintas Acuario). Wanting to give his son a hands-on business experience, Rivera hired his son Lupillo to work at the studio when a contracted singer failed to show up for a recording session.
Lupillo was given the task of looking for local talent at bars, with the idea that some of that talent could be signed by his father's company. When Lupillo first started singing he was called "El Torito" Lupillo Rivera. Later when becoming more famous he was known as "El Toro del Corrido". His uncle was a semi-famous professional boxer, known as El Toro Rivera to Mexican boxing fans. By 1999, Lupillo began to sing using his own name [Lupillo]. By then, he had already signed with Sony Discos. His star began to rise meteorically at that point. In 2001, he was awarded a Premios lo Nuestro.
By 2010, nearly a decade into his career, Rivera had received various Grammy and Latin Grammy nominations for his work, that same year, he was awarded a Grammy Award for his album, Tu Esclavo y Amo.
