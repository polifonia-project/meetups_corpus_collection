Joseph T. "Cap" Shaw (1874â€“1952) was the editor of Black Mask magazine from 1926 to 1936.
Prior to becoming Black Mask editor, Shaw had worked as a newspaper reporter and as a soldier in World War I, attaining the
rank of captain (Shaw's friends gave him the nickname "Cap").
 Shaw was also a professional fencer,
and even won an Olympic medal for his fencing ability. Under his editorship, Black Mask published many works of crime fiction now recognised as classics of the genre, by authors such as Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler,
and Erle Stanley Gardner.Chandler greatly admired Shaw's ability to encourage Black Mask writers, claiming in a letter,
"We wrote better for him than we could have written for anybody else".Despite Black Mask's critical and commercial popularity, Shaw was eventually fired from the magazine, succeeded by Fanny Ellsworth. Shaw then
worked as a literary agent, though without notable success.
