=== The Angels ===

Graham Bidstrup (aka Buzz Throckman) joined The Angels soon after the release of their first single "Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again". Staying until 1981, he recorded the four albums with the band, The Angels (1977), Face to Face (1978), No Exit (1979) and Dark Room (1980) before leaving to pursue a career in music production for films including Heatwave, Starstruck and Greetings from Wollongong many for young bands of the time including The Riptides, The Honeymoon and The Numbers. Three of the Angels albums went platinum, two reaching the top ten. In 1980, Bidstrup co-wrote and co-produced the Angels top ten single, "No Secrets" with singer Doc Neeson.


=== Gang Gajang ===

Bidstrup was a founding member of Gang Gajang. The band emerged in 1984 with Chris Bailey (bandmate from The Angels) on bass guitar, Mark Callaghan from The Riptides, (a band Bidstrup had previously produced) and Kayellen Bee.  They wrote songs and performed on the platinum selling soundtrack to the ABC TV series Sweet and Sour, for which Bidstrup was an Associate Music Director. With the addition of Geoffrey Stapleton on keyboards and Robert James on lead guitar in 1985 the line up was complete and Gang Gajang have now released four albums including the platinum selling self titled album which includes the now iconic song "Sounds of Then (This is Australia)". Bidstrup was the music director for the Quiksilver cult surf film, Mad Wax, that featured Gang Gajang's music exclusively. Gang Gajang were subsequently voted "No 1 band in the World" by the World Professional Surfersâ€™ Association 1988/89.
