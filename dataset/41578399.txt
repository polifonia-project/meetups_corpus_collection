== Career ==
In the early 2000s, he started following the club scene and by 2005 Kura would play on a DJ booth while working at a skate shop near Lisbon and eventually gigs in Cascais's club Coconuts. His first DJ residency came along and he became Bahaus resident DJ for 3 years. His first bootleg was a hit among his peers – Sidney Samson's "Work It" on Hardwell's remix crossed with Bob Marley followed by his first original track, "Russian Guitar" that was picked up by the Portuguese label, Kaos Records. He was invited to play as a resident DJ at Lisbon’s Kapital, and then at the summer club, Tamariz, and then to Gossip, a major club in Lisbon. He also focused on a freelance career, and more invitations to play in bigger venues.
His international breakthrough came with his track "Brazil". Roger Sanchez picked it up for his "Release Yourself Radioshow". Thomas Gold picked Kura's hits "Polaris", "Love Will Find You", a remix of "Nightrain" for his radioshow. Besides these Kura also got support for his tracks from Hardwell, Nicky Romero and EDX, amongst many others. In 2012, he was invited to join the Swiss-based agency WDB Management. He also collaborated with American DJ/producer MAKJ in "Galaxy" and "Old Memories".
