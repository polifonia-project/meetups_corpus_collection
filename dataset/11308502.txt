== Biography ==
Falletta was raised in the borough of Queens in an Italian-American household.  She was educated at the Mannes College of Music and The Juilliard School in New York City. She began her musical career as a guitar and mandolin player, and in her twenties was often called to perform with the Metropolitan Opera and New York Philharmonic when a work called for a mandolin or guitar obbligato.
Falletta entered Mannes in 1972 as a guitar student, but began conducting the student orchestra in her freshman year, which initiated her interest in a conducting career. While the Mannes administration at that time expressed doubts about the ability of any woman to gain a music directorship, it consented to an official transfer of emphasis for Falletta. After graduation, she pursued further study at Queens College (M.A. in orchestral conducting) and the Juilliard School of Music (M.M., D.M.A. in orchestral conducting). Falletta studied conducting with such conductors as Jorge Mester, Sixten Ehrling, and Semyon Bychkov, and also participated in master classes with Leonard Bernstein.
Falletta's first permanent engagement was as music director of the Jamaica Symphony Orchestra, a position she held from 1977 to 1989. She served as music director of the Denver Chamber Orchestra from 1983 to 1992, and as associate conductor of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra from 1985 to 1988.  From 1986 to 1996, she served as music director of the Bay Area Women's Philharmonic.

In April 2018, in a revision to the prior contract announcement, the VSO announced that Falletta was to stand down as its music director in June 2020.  During her tenure, the Virginia Symphony performed at Carnegie Hall in New York and the Kennedy Center in Washington and released 18 recordings including discs on the Naxos label, Albany Records, NPR and the orchestra’s own Hampton Roads label .In May 1998, Falletta was named music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, and she formally took up the post with the 1999–2000 season.

In May 2015, she extended her contract with the BPO through the 2020–2021 season. In 2011 she was appointed artistic director of the Hawaii Symphony Orchestra.

In May 2011, Falletta was named the 12th principal conductor of the Ulster Orchestra, effective with the 2011–2012 season, with an initial contract of 3 years.  She was the first American and the first female conductor to be appointed the orchestra's principal conductor. She concluded her Ulster Orchestra tenure after the 2013-2014 season. She was also the first woman to conduct the orchestra of the National Theatre Mannheim.Falletta served on the National Council on the Arts from 2008 to 2012, following her appointment by President George W.
