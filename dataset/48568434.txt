The highlight of that period was singing back-up for Aretha Franklin at Carnegie Hall.
Her biggest hit came in 1978 with "Take Me I'm Yours", a duet with Michael Henderson.

The album's only single release â€“ "Super Lover" peaked at #92 in July 1979 on the Billboard R&B Singles Charts.

She toured with The Crusaders, sharing the stage with George Benson and Natalie Cole. She came on board with founding Crusaders members Joe Sample, Wilton Felder and Stix Hooper after the departure of Randy Crawford, performing renditions of their 1979 pop hit "Street Life".
