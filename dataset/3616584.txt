The singer/songwriter told CBN.com that he hopes Ocean causes listeners to "look internally… at where they draw their own identity from. It's worth wrestling with who we are, where we draw our value from, and where we draw our life from and .... refocusing on the source of whatever season of life we are in rather than focusing on the season itself."


=== Retirement ===
On April 3, 2013, Bebo Norman announced his impending retirement from music, effective at the end of 2013. On the August 14, 2017, The Pivot podcast, hosted by Andrew Osenga, Norman explained that he had spent time as a stay-at-home dad, started a home renovation business and later supply company, and studied to become a physician assistant.

After marrying in 2003, his priorities shifted, and he eventually mapped out an exit strategy from the life of a touring musician.
