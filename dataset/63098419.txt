== Controversies ==


=== Fake views allegations ===
Aktaş's song "Ela" was released together with a music video on YouTube. The video initially received more likes and comparatively less views, which was pointed out by singer Işın Karaca who accused Aktaş of manipulating the YouTube system. Aktaş responded to the allegations and said "It is a good thing to be ignorant, you think you know everything. No, I'm sad, she actually believes what she has said. She even wrote it in English, what a pity". Also, in an answer to a question on Instagram he made an insulting reference to Karaca without mentioning her name. Demet Akalın later liked a post 
that claimed the music video's number of views was fake and a fraud had taken place.Aleyna Tilki criticized Aktaş's assertion that "he was the first Turk to reach number one on the world music list". Tilki shared a tweet showing that her song "Nasılsın Aşkta" was the first Turkish song to rank first in the world music list and accused Aktaş of putting up a show.


=== Adhan controversy ===
In Ramadan 2019, Aktaş shared a video of himself on social media in which he would start to recite adhan loudly close to people who were waiting for iftar and then laugh as they would actually believe it was the time for iftar. The video went viral on social media and received criticism from various people.In the television program Söylemezsem Olmaz, the subject was taken on by the theologian Arif Arslan. Arslan reacted to the video and questioned Aktaş's actions: "Doesn't he have a mom or dad, did this child pop out of a stone hole?". Arslan also commented on the claim that Aktaş had made fun of the adhan and added that "He has committed apostasy, he must repent". Aktaş made a statement on these comments through his social media accounts and referring to the program's presenters added that he would "bring them to account in court.
