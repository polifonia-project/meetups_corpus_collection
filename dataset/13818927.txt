Deon Jackson (January 26, 1946 â€“ April 18, 2014), was an American soul singer and songwriter.
Jackson was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States. He performed in vocal groups and as a soloist while he attended Ann Arbor High School, and was signed by producer Ollie McLaughlin while still in school. His first single was his own "You Said You Love Me", followed by "Come Back Home"; both were regional hits in his native Michigan.Jackson toured heavily on the local club circuit before releasing his next record, 1966's "Love Makes the World Go 'Round" on Carla Records. The tune became a major pop hit, and an album was released subsequently on Atco Records. Jackson had two more successful singles and recorded until the end of the decade, but then faded from view, living and performing in the Chicago area. He is often referred to as a "one hit wonder". However in the UK he is well known and respected on the Northern soul scene, where his records and unissued recordings are still played to this day.  UK artist Kiki Dee had a minor US hit in 1971 with her cover of "Love Makes the World Go Round."
After having a brain hemorrhage at his home, Jackson died at the Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights, Illinois, on April 18, 2014, at the age of 68.
