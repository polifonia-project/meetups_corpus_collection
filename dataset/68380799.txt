== Musical style ==
Glaive's music has often been described as hyperpop. He has described his own music as "straight-up pop songs" with "nothing hyper about them", and stated that his music being labeled as hyperpop is a result of him being associated with other people who make hyperpop. He has also been deemed a pioneer of the digicore genre, a more underground, largely teenage offshoot of hyperpop that uses elements of trap and emo rap with a DIY ethic. His music has included elements of Midwest emo, emo, glitch, pop punk, hip hop, trap, EDM, and indie rock. He has described his music as being about "being annoyed or mad", and has stated that he is inspired by hip hop production. His lyrics address topics such as alienation and mental health.Colin Joyce of The Fader described Glaive's songs as "genre-hopping" and "self-assured", while Pigeons and Planes wrote that Glaive took a "free-for-all approach" to his music and has "a gift for structure and melody". Vulture's Justin Curto called Glaive's lyrics "painfully honest", while Jeff Ihaza of Rolling Stone wrote that Glaive "has a way with clear-eyed vulnerability". Billboard's Andrew Unterberger called Glaive a "cutting-edge pop artist"; Daisy Jones of Vice stated that his sound was "sugary, emotive and intuitive".
