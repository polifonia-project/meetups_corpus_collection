== Career ==


=== Early education ===
Bueno started dancing at the age of 4. He later graduated in music and performing arts at the Vienna Conservatory of Music. Bueno is also a composer of R&B music, having taken special courses in acting, dancing, and singing. At age 11, he managed to play 4 musical instruments—piano, guitar, drums, and bass guitar. His father was a former vocalist and a 1970 local band lead guitarist.


=== Musical! Die Show ===
Vincent defeated Eva Klikovics and Gudrun Ihninger of 10 contestants / finalists and earned the top prize of 50,000 EUR (3 million PHP) plus the "chance of a lifetime". He first performed "
Greased Lightnin'" (from musical Grease), and then "The Music of the Night" (from The Phantom of the Opera). Vincent got 67% of televotes (landslide victory) from televiewers in Austria and nearby countries. Second-placer Austrian Eva Klikovics received 37% of televotes, and Gudrun Ihninger was eliminated earlier and salvaged third place. The television show is a reality-based talent contest that considers contestants’ theatrical and dancing skills or abilities, which in turn are judged by televiewers' vote by phone or SMS.The contest Musical! Die Show began an elimination round on 23 November 2007 with 10 contestants from the 400 beginners who auditioned. Austria and other European televiewers rated / televoted the finalists. "Hair" was Vincent's first number, and he performed the memorable songs "I Wanna Be Like You" from Jungle Book, "Superstar" from Jesus Christ Superstar, "Why God Why?" from Miss Saigon, "Singin' in the Rain", and the German "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!" from Mary Poppins. Musical! Die Show, a project of Austrian broadcasting TV ORF, is not an ordinary singing competition like Starmania or American Idol. Completely different, it involves theater arts and musical and acting abilities. Specifically, unlike Western and Asian talent show contests, Musical! Die Show is comparatively more difficult and challenging due to its theatre leanings. Aspirants act and sing à la Broadway, and instead of merely singing pop tunes, they choose Broadway musical theater repertoire.Miss Saigon veterans (from the original cast of the West End production of Miss Saigon in 1989) Isay Alvarez and Robert Seña called Vincent Bueno, a phenomenon: "He's very good. Ibang klase siya. Pinanood ko siya nang todo. Impressed kami pareho ni Robert sa kanya. (He's a class of his own. I watched him closely. Robert and I are impressed with him). Vincent is a phenomenon. Marami siyang patataubin na singer lalo na sa Broadway musical singing. Kasi, bagay na bagay ang kanyang boses sa gano'ng genre. (He can upstage many local singers, especially in Broadway musical singing, because his voice fits the genre)."


=== Foray to the Philippines ===
His first performance on Philippine television's ASAP XV was on 29 August 2010, where he was first introduced as the "Pinoy Champ Austrian Singer". He was on ASAP for some weeks. He also signed a contract under Star Records. However, he returned to Austria on 14 September 2010 to accomplish his pending tasks there. He then went back to the Philippines by early January 2011 to continue his music career.
On 28 October 2011, Vincent held his first ever mini-concert at Teatrino in Greenhills, San Juan, entitled "Got Fridays with Vincent Bueno".


=== Eurovision Song Contest ===
On 12 December 2019, ORF internally selected Bueno to represent Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. He was to perform the song "Alive". However, on 18 March 2020, the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Later in March 2020, ORF confirmed that Vincent Bueno will instead represent Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest 2021. He performed the song "Amen" in the second semi-final on 20 May 2021, but failed to qualify, finishing 12th.
