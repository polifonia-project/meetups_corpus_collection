After the war, on 24 July 1946, he married Nives Polak and they had one son and two daughters. In 1947, their daughter Varja, a later prominent linguist, was born to them.

He engaged in extensive work based on critical study of sources and issues of musical style to create a solid basis for Slovenian music history, providing an impetus for similar work elsewhere in Yugoslavia. His critical editions of compositions are of exceptional importance; they were the first of their kind in Slovenia (e.g., Skladatelji Gallus, Plautzius, Dolar in njihovo delo, 1963; J. Gallus Carniolus, Harmoniale morales, 1966; J. Gallus Carniolus, Moralia, 1968). He published numerous articles in Yugoslav and international periodicals. He participated in international musicological conferences and delivered talks at various universities and institutions, and also in radio broadcasts.
The Department of Musicology was founded at the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Arts in 1962 as a result of his efforts. In 1965 he started publishing the journal Muzikološki zbornik (Musicological Proceedings), which included contributions from Yugoslavia and abroad. In 1972 he founded the SAZU Institute of Musicology, which began operating in 1980.He died in Ljubljana at the age of 82 years. On 18 September 2011, a bust of him was unveiled in his native village of Vučja Vas.
