== Influences ==
According to jazz critic Joe Segal, Cox was influenced by Earl Bostic and Charlie Parker:
"Sonny's general sound is an amalgamation of the jazz feeling (derived from a Charlie Parker spark) and a warm fuzzy throaty sound and approach influenced by the daddy of the rock altoists Earl Bostic" (liner notes of Argo 4036). He also sounds sometimes like Hank Crawford.
