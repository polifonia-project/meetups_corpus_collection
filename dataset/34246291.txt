Franco (Gian) Manzecchi (September 10, 1931, Ravenna â€“ March 25, 1979, Konstanz) was an Italian drummer.


== Biography ==
Manzecchi's older brother Gino was also a trumpeter and drummer. He moved from his hometown Ravenna, Italy, to Bologna, then to Vienna, Austria, and Saint Moritz, Switzerland, before he coincidentally went to Paris, France, in early 1957 and settled down there, playing with various ensembles. After a heart surgery in 1976 he had to partially quit music and retired to Lake Constance, Germany, with his German wife and son Patrick (who is a renowned jazz drummer himself) before passing away two years later. He is most famous for working and recording with Chet Baker, Eric Dolphy, Larry Young, Clark Terry, Bill Coleman, Lou Bennett, Mal Waldron and more.
