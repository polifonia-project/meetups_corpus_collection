The band members' onstage costume includes bowties, plaid pants, taped glasses, pocket protectors and short shorts. The costumes are a homage to the film Revenge of the Nerds. Perfect World Entertainment created a fictional biography for the Spazmatics as part of the band's gig.


=== The Spazmatics story ===
In 1983, the band was formed after Kevin Stigwood, a physics teacher at Alta Dena High in Thousand Oaks, California, lost a debate to a student. In result, Stigwood performed "She Blinded Me With Science" by Thomas Dolby at the state basketball championship game with the Spazmatics, a band he formed. Stigwood established the band with his brother, Curtis, Sidney Baderman and Rusty A. Woosmeir.
