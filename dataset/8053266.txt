== Early life ==
Nicci Gilbert was born as Nicole Gilbert on July 8, 1970 in Detroit, Michigan, United States to African-American parents. Gilbert grew up in Detroit, where her mother Helene was a jazz singer. Gilbert's mom did a lot to encourage her interest in music, and when she was in high school, Gilbert performed Madonna's "Crazy for You" in a talent show.
After graduating from high school, Gilbert studied music and drama at Eastern Michigan University. But she ended up dropping out after two years so that she could move to L.A. with a friend and be closer to the music industry. It was a risky move, but one that eventually paid off for her. At first, Gilbert struggled in L.A., where she appeared in various talent shows while paying her bills with non-musical "day gigs" (including a job at Taco Bell). But things started to pick up for Gilbert when, in 1993, she formed Brownstone's original lineup with Monica Doby and Charmayne Maxwell.

Their debut album From the Bottom Up was released on January 10, 1995 and reached its peak at number twenty-nine on the Billboard Hot 200 chart. Their next single, If You Love Me, became a smash hit charting at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart in the United States.
