Collins joined The Charlatans in 1991 after Jon Baker's departure.
"I just went down there thinking the Charlatans wanted a second guitarist. I turned up with my guitar at a rehearsal room in Birmingham; there was no other guitarist there and they just said "Do you fancy joining the band?" I said "Oh. Go on then, why not?" It all happened really quickly." ~ Mark Collins
Collins made his debut on a non-album single, "Me. In Time", and while the band was not satisfied with the release itself, he has remained with them ever since.In 2003, he produced the track "Same Sad Story" from Adam Masterson's debut album, which was released as a single later in November that year. Same year, Collins joined Starsailor, playing additional and lead guitar on their nationwide UK tour and the Isle of Wight Festival later in 2005.
