== Personal life ==

== Music career ==
Anders Odden started out as a black metal musician and artist in the mid 80s, and went on to start one of Norway's first death metal bands, Cadaver, in 1988. He formed Magenta in 1995 as an outlet for other musical ideas than death metal. Celtic Frost recruited him as their live guitarist in 2006. He toured Europe, USA, Canada and Japan with them on their Monotheist Tour, which ended in 2007. After Celtic Frost he co-founded metal super group Doctor Midnight & The Mercy Cult that lasted between 2009 and 2011. He had by then joined Satyricon as their temp live bass player in 2009, but moved on to hold this position permanently from 2013. He performed on "Live at the Opera" DVD/CD/LP with Satyricon released 2015 and is currently involved with the band's coming album TBA 2017. In 2013 he founded the old school back metal band ORDER together with Manheim (ex-Mayhem), Messiah (ex-Mayhem) and Rene Jansen (ex-Cadaver). When Rene Jansen died 3 December 2014 ORDER decided to continue. They recruited Stu Manx (ex-Gluecifer) in August 2015 and released their debut demo tape, "Folly Grandeur", in April 2016.
Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Odden worked as a consultant for music organizations in Norway, such as RIO, GramArt, MIC and MFO (Musicians Union in Norway). He is the founder of music business seminar IMC, which is held during the annual Inferno Festival in Oslo, Norway. In 2011 he released his autobiography, "Piratliv", on Jurtizen Forlag which received great reviews in Norwegian media.
