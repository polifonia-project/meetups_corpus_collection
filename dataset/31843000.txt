== Early life and education ==
Natassia Zolot was born on September 24, 1989, in San Francisco. She has Russian ancestry from Hungary on her mother's side. Her mother, Elka Zolot, was a member of the San Francisco garage punk band The Trashwomen. Kreayshawn moved to East Oakland and acquired her first video camera at age ten, whereupon she started documenting her raps and films about herself and everyday life.At the age of 13, Natassia enrolled at MetWest High School, which she described as a "new alternative type of high school". Instead of having the usual classes, such as English and mathematics, she had to take an internship at a local radio station three days a week. She was dissatisfied with the lack of work and wanted to go to a normal high school, so she switched to Oakland High School. However, according to Kreayshawn, she "went to none of [her] classes, ever" at her new school, which led to her finishing the term with a 0.0 grade point average and getting expelled for truancy. After taking a short break, she went to Alameda High School but after a few months she was expelled. After the incident, she then enrolled in the continuation high school, Island High, where she then completed her second year. While attending, she again began skipping school for weeks on end. After two weeks, she returned to find out the school moved to a different location. Since she had no address or any contact with the school she was unable to find the new location and never went back.At the age of 16, she moved to live with her aunt in Berkeley and was taking care of her little cousin. She later moved again to live with her friend V-Nasty and enrolled in a work program, where she passed her GED test. After graduating, she received financial support from her work program and used the money to get her own apartment. When she was 17, she got a laptop and began recording songs and exploring her interest in cinematography, by shooting music videos for local artists such as Lil B. Her videos caught the attention of Dean Patrick Kriwanek, and she attended Berkeley Digital Film Institute with a full scholarship for two semesters. She then moved to Los Angeles to pursue her music video career. Her manager Chioke McCoy, whom she met while directing a video for DB tha General, encouraged her take on a music career of her own.
