Majik Boys is an American DJ and remix group, playing at clubs and on internet radio channels. It was founded in 2008 by producers Mike Zaplatosch and Andy Garcia (formerly Zapp & Vice) and Billboard Reporting DJ Jeremy Martorano.  Mike and Andy have produced hits for Rihanna, Daphne Rubin-Vega,  Joanna Krupa, Lauren Hildebrandt, David Longoria, Dare 2B Dif'rnt, and Georgie Porgie.  Their Hi-NRG club sound has been influenced by Spencer & Hill, Bimbo Jones, Soul Seekerz, Digital Dog, Chris Cox, Tony Moran, The Sound Factory, and Almighty.  Majik Boys' first remix to reach top 5 on the US Billboard Club Chart was Rihanna's "Breakin Dishes".
Mike and Jeremy of the Majik Boys emit a weekly syndicated mixshow on five popular internet dance stations: iPartyRadio.com, iDanceRadio.fm, GayInternetRadioLive.com, 1Club.fm, and ZFM (Australia).  Jeremy has been DJing for 17 years and retouches much of what he plays to give it a hi-NRG, "hands in the air" sound.
