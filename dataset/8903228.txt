Jimmy Wayne Jamison (August 23, 1951 – August 31, 2014) was an American musician, singer, and songwriter. Best known as Jimi Jamison, he earned recognition as the frontman for the bands Target, Cobra, and the platinum-selling rock band Survivor from 1984 to 1989, performing the songs "Burning Heart" from the film Rocky IV, "The Moment of Truth" from The Karate Kid, along with other top-20 Survivor hits "I Can't Hold Back", "High On You", "The Search is Over" and "Is This Love". He officially rejoined Survivor in 2000, remaining in the group until 2006, only to rejoin again in 2011. Acclaimed as one of the top male vocalists of all time, Jamison is also known for having co-written and performed the theme song "I'm Always Here" for the 1990s TV series Baywatch.


== Early life ==
Jimmy Wayne Jamison was born in rural Durant, Mississippi but self-identified as a Memphis, Tennessee native, as he and his mother Dorothy moved there when he was one day old. In his teens, growing up in Blues-Rock and Soul music, he taught himself how to play the guitar and piano. The first song Jimi ever performed in front of a crowd was "Daytripper" by The Beatles, while he was in middle school (Sherwood) in the mid-1960s.


== Career ==


=== Early career ===
After having seen Jamison sing, Jamison's friend Jack Rowell invited him to play in an R&B band called The Debuts. It was to be Jamison's first taste of success, and he was only 12 years old at the time. While students at Messick High School, the band had a hit with their first single, the Wayne Carson-penned "If I Cry" in 1968. It was a song originally intended for fellow Memphis band The Box Tops, but the group discarded the tune before recording it; Box Tops frontman Alex Chilton gave it to The Debuts instead. The band were picked up and signed by Atlantic Records. Soon the teenagers hit the road with the likes of Roy Orbison and Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels, also touring with The Buckinghams. The band broke up in 1969, but Jimi and Rowell continued playing together years later before going their separate ways.


=== Target (1974–1980) ===
After the second sessions recording with David Beaver, both Jamison and Cathey teamed up with guitarist Buddy Davis and formed the Memphis southern rock band Target in the mid 1970s. The band started and became a local arena band playing live constantly building up their reputation. Having success, the band released the albums Target (1976) and Captured (1977) on A&M Records with the singles "Are you Ready", "Let Me Live" and "It is Only Love", opening concerts for Black Sabbath, Boston, and KISS.


=== Cobra (1981–1983) ===
In 1982, Jamison joined guitarist Mandy Meyer (ex-Krokus), guitarist/keyboardist Jack Holder (ex-Black Oak Arkansas), bassist Tommy Keiser, and drummer Jeff Klaven in the band Cobra, managed by Butch Stone (who also managed Target as well as Krokus and Black Oak Arkansas), replacing original vocalist Tommy Andris. The band became a hit in the Memphis scene and signed with Epic Records. The group released one album, the Tom Allom-produced First Strike, in 1983. The British music magazine Kerrang! listed the album at number one in its import charts with the song "Blood On Your Money" getting MTV airplay, being Jamison's first music video."Looking at You" and "Travelin' Man" were promoted at the Memphis TV Club. Cobra started touring in the United States opening for Quiet Riot, Nazareth, and Krokus. Their live performance on November 27, 1983, was broadcast on the King Biscuit Flower Hour (KBFH) and later partly released on the Live Attack! and Only You Can Rock Me bootlegs. The live set included a half dozen unreleased songs, including their original "I'm a Fighter", written by Jimi and Mandy, which was covered by the group Van Zant in the mid-1980s. Meanwhile, First Strike was only a moderate commercial success, and the band split at the end of the year, primarily due to each member wanting to do different things.


=== Survivor (1984–1989) ===
After Cobra's demise in 1984, Jamison was invited to join Survivor, whose success had been waning since their number-one hit "Eye of the Tiger" in 1982. The band had recently parted ways with original singer Dave Bickler, due to his vocal cord injuries that required a lengthy convalescence. After a successful audition with the band, Jamison joined them despite some misgivings about Survivor's pop rock sound. He provided an instant spark to the band, having great success, putting the band back on top. His first recording with the band was "The Moment of Truth" (The Karate Kid theme song), which reached number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 1984.Jamison's first full album with Survivor, and the band's fifth overall, was Vital Signs, released later in 1984. That album reached number 16 on the Billboard Album Chart and was certified platinum by the RIAA. The album included the hit singles "High on You" (which reached number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart),  "I Can't Hold Back" (number 13 on the singles chart and number 1 on Top Rock Tracks chart), with Jamison proving to be a worthy frontman and a photogenic face of the band, which helped the video for this song get significant airplay on MTV, and "The Search Is Over" (number 4 on the singles chart and number 1 on the adult contemporary chart). "First Night" also reached number 53 on the singles chart.The band began touring in Chicago and Indianapolis in 1984, in 1985 the band went on tour with headliner Bryan Adams, performing at his sold-out concerts at Nashville's War Memorial Auditorium, the Dallas Convention Center, the San Antonio Convention Center and the Lakefront Arena in New Orleans. They also toured with REO Speedwagon around that time with appearances at San Diego sports arena and other venues, plus touring in Tokyo, Japan in which they released a DVD of the concert and appearing and performing in different Japanese Television Shows. That same year Survivor was requested by Stallone once again to do the theme song for the next Rocky film, achieving another hit with "Burning Heart" from the film Rocky IV. In early 1986, the single peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.Jamison's second album with Survivor, When Seconds Count, was released on October 9, 1986, and included the hit single "Is This Love" (number 9 on the singles chart). The album peaked at a disappointing number 49 on the Billboard Album Chart but still managed to sell over 500,000 copies and was certified Gold. This album also featured Jamison making songwriting contributions to the band's repertoire, including the single "Man Against the World" (number 86). This song was originally slated for inclusion on the Rocky IV soundtrack and was in fact later included in that album's 2006 reissue. Another single, "How Much Love" peaked at number 51 on the singles chart, while "In Good Faith" was promoted in Europe, with the band performing in German TV Shows.Survivor released their final 80's album Too Hot to Sleep in late 1988. Jamison would later cite the album as his personal favorite with Survivor, but it suffered from a lack of record company promotion and only reached number 187 on the Billboard albums chart. Three singles were released, with "Across the Miles" reaching number 74 on the singles chart, "Didn't Know It Was Love" reaching number 61, and "Desperate Dreams" receiving promotion in Europe, but the band could not sustain the success from their previous albums.


=== Solo career (1989–1999) ===
In 1989, Jamison contributed his own version of "Ever Since the World Began", a song Survivor had initially recorded prior to his tenure in the band, to the Sylvester Stallone's film, Lock Up, after being requested by Stallone. That same year, he was invited to join Deep Purple, who had just fired longtime singer Ian Gillan. After a two-week session with the band, he reluctantly parted ways with them; according to Deep Purple organist Jon Lord, "He [Jamison] was an enormous Deep Purple fan and he would happily have taken over the job. But at the time he was afraid of his managers. They didn't want him to leave [Survivor] and he didn't dare to get into a fight with them." In fact, Jamison's managers wanted him to concentrate on his upcoming solo album instead of joining Deep Purple. Also in 1989, Jamison briefly united with his Target bandmates for a "10-Year Reunion" concert in Memphis and was part of the New Year's Eve celebration in the Crown Plaza.  It was also around this time that Jamison performed the entrance song "Hard Time" for the wrestler Big Boss Man when he was in the WWF.Jamison's first solo album When Love Comes Down was released in July, 1991. While neither the album nor any of its singles made much impact on the charts, the songs "Rock Hard" and "Taste of Love" were used in episodes of Baywatch, and the latter was also used in the 1992 film Jersey Girl. Jamison's association with Baywatch began that same year, when CBS enlisted him to create a song for the then-just acquired TV Series; Jimi would co-write (with Cory Lerios and John D'Andrea) and perform "I'm Always Here," the series theme song. The song achieved success and pop culture recognition, with various versions of the song appearing as the show's opening theme until 2001.Jamison began touring under the name Survivor or Jimi Jamison's Survivor with a new solo band consisting of Hal Butler (keyboards, vocals), Jeff Adams (bass, vocals), Bill Marshall (drums), and initially official Survivor member Frankie Sullivan on guitar, though he was soon replaced by Jeff Miller. Sullivan and Jim Peterik from the "official" Survivor then filed a lawsuit against their one-time bandmate for continuing to bill his group as "Survivor", but were unsuccessful in preventing Jamison from touring under the band's name until 1999. During this period, the Scotti Brothers label released two Survivor compilation albums featuring songs from Jamison's tenure.The solo album Empires, featuring a re-recorded version of "I'm Always Here" and a cover of "Love is Alive" by Gary Wright, was released under the name Jimi Jamison's Survivor in October 1999.


=== Second tenure with Survivor (2000–2006) ===
Jamison reunited with Survivor in March 2000, replacing original singer Dave Bickler once again. In 2002, the band released "Christmas is Here", which reached No. 6 on the Mediabase Christmas charts. In 2005, Jamison and the band were part of a Starbucks commercial, making an Eye of the Tiger parody, which gave them an Emmy Nomination. Jamison and the band released the album Reach in April 2006. The album was Survivor's first new album in 18 years. Jamison quit the band shortly after the release of Reach, on July 14.


=== Return to solo work (2007–2014) ===
Jamison released the solo album Crossroads Moment in Europe in July 2008 and in America the following year. The album was produced by his former Survivor bandmate Jim Peterik. He continued touring in Rio, Brazil, Chile and in Barcelona, Spain. A companion album of outtakes called Extra Moments was released in 2010, the additional tracks had been compiled by Jamison and Peterik as a benefit for the music website melodicrock.com.In 2011, Jamison teamed up with Toto singer Bobby Kimball for the album Kimball Jamison. The two singers shared lead vocals on songs written by Richard Page (Mr Mister), Randy Goodrum (Toto, Steve Perry), John Waite, and other notable rock songwriters.During this period Jamison also formed the band One Man's Trash with Fred Zahl. That group released the album History in December 2011 for Starhouse Records. The band earned an endorsement from the guitar company Hofner.


=== Final tenure with Survivor (2011–2014) ===
Jamison again reunited with Survivor in 2011. In November of that year he performed Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger" (on which he did not sing originally) for boxer Manny Pacquiao's entrance into the ring for his bout against Shane Mosley at MGM Grand Las Vegas. Fueled by popular demand, Jamison would repeat the performance the following year for the boxer's next title defense.In 2013, it was announced on the band's official media sources that Sullivan had reunited the current Survivor line-up with Bickler. They were also working on new material and looking forward to getting back into the studio together. Jamison participated in further tours with Survivor and would remain with the band until his death in 2014.Jamison's last show was on August 30, 2014, in Morgan Hill, California, at the CANcert benefit event during the ARTTEC Summer Concert Series (arttecusa.com). The benefit raised funds and awareness for two non-profits supporting cancer patients as well as career training opportunities for high school students. Survivor's 58-minute set consisted of "Feels Like Love", "Broken Promises", "Take You on a Saturday", "High on You", "Rockin' into the Night", "The Search Is Over", "Rebel Girl", "I Can't Hold Back", "Burning Heart", "Poor Man's Son", "It's the Singer Not the Song" and ended with "Eye of the Tiger".


== Collaborations ==
Throughout his career, Jamison provided background vocals for several bands and artists such as Degarmo & Key (This Ain't Hollywood, 1980, Heat it Up, 1993 and To Extremes, 1994); Gary Chapman (Sincerely Yours, 1981); Mylon LeFevre & Broken Heart (Brand New Start, 1982 and Sheep In Wolves Clothing, 1985); Krokus (Headhunter, 1983 and The Blitz, 1984); Molly Hatchet (The Deed is Done, 1984); and The Blackwood Brothers (All Their Best, 1984). He provided backing vocals throughout ZZ Top's 1983 album Eliminator and also for that band's contribution to the Back to the Future III soundtrack in 1990. Frontman Billy Gibbons referred to Jamison as the "fourth member" of the group after working, touring and hanging out with them in multiple occasions.Jamison contributed vocals for Joe Walsh on the albums Got any Gum? (1987), Ordinary Average Guy (1991), and Songs for a Dying Planet (1992). He was co-lead vocals with Walsh on the 1991 single "All of a Sudden", which reached number 13 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. He also worked with the Fabulous Thunderbirds (Powerful Stuff, 1989), Ten Years After (About Time, 1989), Omar & the Howlers (Wall of Pride, 1988), Eric Gales Band (The Eric Gales Band, 1991 and Picture of a Thousand Faces, 1993), and Chris Bailey.

He released the single "House That Love Built" in early 2010 as a benefit for the Ronald McDonald House of Memphis.  He also recorded the charity single "One Family" in 2011 with the all-star ensemble United Rockers 4 U, which also included Bobby Kimball, Don Dokken, Eddie Money, Jeff Paris, Paul Shortino, Phil Lewis, Richie Kotzen, and Robin McAuley. Jamison contributed backing vocals to the album Naked but Dressed by Dominoe in 2012. He contributed to an all-star tribute to Steve Miller Band in 2013.


== Style and legacy ==
Jamison earned acclaim for his vocal abilities. "We didn't even consider it [pitch editing] on him," sound engineer Terry Manning says. "We didn't even have it back then. He never needed it. He could hold pitch. He could sing vibrato when needed. He could sing straight when needed. He could do whatever you needed. Casey Kasem, the big DJ guy, called him 'The Voice.' That's what he named him. He just was the voice." Jamison is an Honorary Member of the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. Rolling Stone magazine called Jamison "a true Rock and Roll Legend."


== Personal life and death ==
In 1972, Jamison married Brenda Fay, who is the mother of his first daughter Amy. They divorced in 1983 and Jamison later married Debbie Teal in 1985. With Teal, he had two more children, James and Lacy. Jamison and Teal separated in 1999 but remained married until his death. When not traveling or performing, Jamison enjoyed gardening, throwing horseshoes, various sports such as tennis and golf, and spending time with his family.Jamison died on August 31, 2014, at his home in Raleigh, Memphis, Tennessee, nine days after his 63rd birthday. His autopsy said he had cardiovascular disease and narrowing of the arteries and that he died of a hemorrhagic brain stroke, with "acute methamphetamine intoxication contributing."
