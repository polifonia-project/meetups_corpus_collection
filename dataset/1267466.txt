Sixtoo was the main project of a Canadian underground hip hop DJ, producer and rapper Vaughn Robert Squire between 1996 and 2007. He has since retired the Sixtoo name pursuing other directions in electronic music, with a large genre shift from experimental hip hop to deeper club sounds of various tempos. He has also released music as Speakerbruiser Rob, and Prison Garde.


== History ==
Sixtoo rose to prominence in the mid 1990s underground hip hop scene initially as half of Halifax, Nova Scotia hip hop duo Sebutones, along with Buck 65. During that time, he worked with Sage Francis, Moka Only, Mr. Dibbs and other members of Anticon.In 2000, Sixtoo moved to Montreal where he signed on with UK based record label Vertical Form. Soon after came the release of Antagonist Survival Kit, a synth-based sample album that showcased both sides of his skills: on the mic and on the sampler.In 2003, Sixtoo signed to Ninja Tune. His debut album on the label, Chewing on Glass & Other Miracle Cures, has won acclaim in the international electronic beats community in 2004.Since silencing the Sixtoo project, he has had a string of visible live P.A. projects including Megasoid along with Hadji Bakara, a former member of Wolf Parade. He has also collaborated with Ango (born Andrew Gordon Macpherson) and Lunice (born Lunice Pierre Fermin) on the electronic music project Nouveau Palais. The trio released Avant Gang in 2012.Sixtoo entirely produced Isaiah Toothtaker's Sea Punk Funk in 2012.
