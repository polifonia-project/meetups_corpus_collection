Imre Czomba (born September 9, 1972) is a Los Angeles-based Hungarian American composer, film composer, orchestrator, arranger, music producer, and musician. A prominent figure in the international music scene since 1993, he is most recognized for his numerous theatrical compositions and productions, including musicals, international events, and dance theatre shows. Imre earned international acclaim for his 18-year collaboration with ExperiDance, a famous dance troupe whose shows premiered in top theaters across Europe and Asia. His international repertoire includes compositions for the 2008 Summer and 2014 Winter Olympic Games, and the 2013 European Judo Championship, and the 2006 European Aquatic Championship Official Song. In 2008 and 2009 Imre was selected to compose music for the prestigious Hungarian National Day firework shows, each with a viewership of over 3 million people. Czomba has worked with world-famous star friends as Kenny G, Michael Boddicker, Alphonso Johnson (Weather Report, Santana), Ed Calle (Gloria Estefan, Michael Bolton), Richie Garcia (Phill Collins band), Michael O'Neill (musician) (Barbra Streisand band) etc. on his #QuarantineMusicChain project.


== Early life ==
At an early point in his career, Imre was inspired by the blues, which can be clearly heard in his piano playing. He has been a member of several top blues bands and has performed on the same stages with B. B. King, Sting, Zucchero, Pink and Robben Ford.  Imre has appeared on over 110 albums and as a composer, arranger, orchestrator, music producer, and musician. He has been the recipient of 18 Gold, 14 Platinum and 4 Double Platinum albums. In the pop music world, his most notable success was with the band Nox, who went on to win a number of local awards, including the Golden Giraffe.


== Quarantine Music Chain ==
Czomba's friends joined from sixteen countries on this truly diverse and exciting musical trip. Stars from the US, Germany, Australia, Canada, Egypt, Norway, Slovakia, France, Germany, New Zealand, China, Russia, Israel, Norway, Argentina, and  Hungary, and of course from Hollywood, appear in the production - composers, musicians and singers alike. The internationally acclaimed artist initially called only a few of his friends to see if they would like to take part in a joint song recorded from home, but his list was filled in moments with yeses from stars like Kenny G, Michael Boddicker, Alphonso Johnson (Weather Report, Santana), Ed Calle(Gloria Estefan, Michael Bolton), Richie Garcia (Phill Collins band), Sara Andon, Andrew Kesler (Accent), Michael O'Neill (musician) (Barbra Streisand band), etc. Czomba, in response to the constraints, conducted a joint jam session recorded from home with the help of more than 100 famous co-creators. However, the music was not composed by an artist alone, but it was born in a special way, as a result of the inspiring voices of more composers.

In 2000 Imre's career took a different turn when he was asked to compose music for several successful plays such as Merlin Theatre's Deathtrap. That experience leads to a meeting with choreographer Sandor Roman with whom Imre developed the unique harmony of dance and music for ExperiDance. The dance group is committed to the heritage of Hungarian folk dance. Imre is successfully composing an outstanding music repertoire built around Hungarian folk music but also manages to step outside its boundaries. This new musical direction has turned into a romantic and grandiose part of world-music. These stage-shows are regularly played on the main stages of Budapest's top theaters, and in bigger cities countrywide as guest-performances. He has many successful musical plays, for example, Birth of a Country(2007). The shows were performed with 250 dancers and 10 singers at Budapest's most famous Hero Square. Untouchables(2012) played at the Margaret Island Open-Air Stage and The Taming of the Shrew (Makrancos Kata)(2013) played at the RaM Colosseum.
