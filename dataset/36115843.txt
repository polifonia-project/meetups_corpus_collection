== Controversy ==
Nigerian artiste Reminisce recorded a diss track "ATA (Street Kitchen Reply)" with the line, "V-E what shit ki lo’n je be. Shebi iwo lo rap ju shit o ma pe’n nbe" in reply to Vector's verse on Sauce Kid's "KitcheStreet" in which Vector said "For all those boys wey dey show. Ti e ba fe ma form pe eyin lata ani tomato to ma to".After this incidence Vector has replied with the track "Distractions (Reminisce Diss)", which he featured on with renowned lyricist A-Q. Vector hit him with the lines, "Cos you bleach your skin doesn't mean you are enlightened, Pig. I'm the base and my crew be strong, you cannot be the best cause you had one stupid song" and "And I'm made oh, and it's so public. But you, your life is like your videos, low budget." He is presently in a rap supremacy battle with Jude "M.I" Abaga, and has released diss tracks such as "The Purge" (featuring Vader and Paper) and also #JudasTheRat which was a response to M.I's #ThaViper.
In 2020, Vector and Jude "M.I" Abaga seem to have squashed their battle when they both met in the third and final part of “The Conversation”, a Hennessy Nigeria documentary series based on the rivalry between M.I and Vector, the duo met face-to-face and discussed what transpired between them. Both rappers addressed what caused the beef and their thoughts on each other. M.I said he had the impression that Vector just doesn't like him, while Vector said he believes M.I is cunning and deceptive.
When asked by the interview if there is the possibility of a collaboration, Vector replied: “If this energy is pure, then there is no way I don't see a collaboration happening”He however said in February 2021 that his beef with M.I sold them records. He said  “Did we make money with the beef tracks? Yes, the records sold. Yes, there comes a special demand for beef tracks by the fans. Our songs were streamed a lot; I mean, we trended at number one in the Genius.com, a lyrics website, which means Nigerians can go on and write something for the world to read and enjoy".
