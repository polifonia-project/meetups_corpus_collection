== Biography ==
Seiter's first official credit came on a 1972 recording of Peter and the Wolf for United Artists, the brainchild of actor and director Rob Reiner. Seiter first rose to prominence, however, as a member of the pop group Spanky and Our Gang. He joined the band in 1967, shortly after they achieved their first charting hit, "Sunday Will Never Be the Same", and stayed for three studio albums and a live concert recording. The band collapsed after the 1968 death of Malcolm Hale, and Seiter accepted a position as drummer for The Turtles, replacing John Barbata. The Turtles recorded one final studio album, Turtle Soup, then disbanded as well. Seiter next joined Rosebud for their eponymous debut, but shortly after the album's release the band collapsed in the wake of the divorce of members Judy Henske and Jerry Yester. Seiter subsequently remained active in the music scene, recording with such varied performers as Aztec Two-Step, Jane Getz, Tom Waits, and The Conception Corporation.  His younger brother Jimmi Seiter is also a noted percussionist.
