I hated more people knowing about the first song I'd ever written and not my others. I was so stubborn but I grew into it and accepted that's just how life works. I was extremely grateful for its existence and it's only given me more opportunities."Beabadoobee announced her debut studio album, Fake It Flowers, and released its lead single "Care" on 14 July 2020. In early August 2020, she released the album's second single, "Sorry", and revealed the album's track listing, cover art and official release date.

The artist announced that the single is taken from her new EP Our Extended Play, which she claimed that wrote it with her labelmates, "on the countryside". "I wanted to experiment on the sounds and sonics even more and the EP to me has a feeling of togetherness to it… how we’re all in this joined as one." 


== Artistry and reception ==
Beabadoobee has cited Elliott Smith, The Moldy Peaches, Pavement, Mazzy Star, The Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel and Daniel Johnston as her musical influences. She has told Vice that she plans on making film soundtracks in the future, as they heavily inspired her to make music. On her background and using YouTube to find success, she said:
"My very traditional Asian family had the classic way of thinking: ‘play an orchestra instrument’ or ‘be a doctor’. Today, people start off making beats on a laptop, but hopefully I encourage young people to pick up the guitar and rock out! YouTube tutorials are a great way to develop your own style, and go at your own pace."
Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, Khalid, Jaden Smith, and Matty Healy of The 1975 have each expressed their admiration for Beabadoobee.
