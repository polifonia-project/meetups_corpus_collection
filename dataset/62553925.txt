She toured in South America in 1920.Stillings became suddenly blind in the 1920s, and after that focused on teaching. "It has been a handicap, but also a blessing," she told an interviewer in 1940. "It has made my critical hearing ever so much more acute. Besides, something like this makes us so human." She was on the faculty at the New Jersey College for Women from 1927 to 1952, and taught her own master classes in New York City, which were modeled on the pedagogy of Joachim and Auer. Her students included conductor Walter Eisenberg.Stillings published violin exercise books for children, The Great Adventure (1928), At the Crossroads (1929), and The Giant Talks (1929), and wrote compositions with titles like "Take a Little Eighth Note", "Tick Tock", and "Double Meaning". She also took an interest in cookery, sharing recipes for fruit dishes with a newspaper in 1940.
