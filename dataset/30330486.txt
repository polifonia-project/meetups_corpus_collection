Mary Lucas (born Mary Anderson Juler, 24 May 1882–14 January 1952), sometimes referred to as Mary Anderson Lucas, was an English composer and pianist.


== Biography ==
Her father was a doctor, and she was one of five children, growing up in London and (from 1891) Chipstead in Surrey. She studied piano at the Dresden Conservatory with Carlo Albanesi (1856-1926) and (later in life, during the 1920s) composition at the Royal College of Music with Herbert Howells, R.O. Morris and Maurice Jacobson. She married entrepreneur and inventor Ralph Lucas in 1903, and their son Colin became a noted architect.


== Music ==
Lucas gave up composition for over 25 years after she married, but returned in the 1930s to produce a number of successful compositions, including six string quartets. The Stratton String Quartet championed her music, performing her quartets at the London Music Club's First Performance Society on 29 November 1934 at 22 Holland Park, and in January 1935 at the Blackheath Concert Halls. There was a BBC broadcast of the third quartet by the all female Macnaghten Quartet on 4 February 1936.Lucas had a special affinity with the clarinet, and may have encouraged her niece Pauline Juler (1914-2003) to become a professional clarinetist. (Juler later became associated with the clarinet music of composers such as York Bowen, Gerald Finzi and Howard Ferguson). Her Clarinet Sonata was written for Juler in 1938. Around this time she was also performing  duo recitals with the clarinet Rudolph Dunbar, and a recording of them playing her Lament for clarinet and piano was issued by Octacros Records in the late-1930s. A performance of the impressionistic Circus Suite for orchestra, conducted by Henry Wood at the Royal Albert Hall on 4 July 1942, gave Lucus her Proms debut at the age of sixty.Her papers (including some recordings) are partially housed at the British Library, while some manuscripts and other papers are held at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. A Lucas family archive is held at the Dennis Sharpe Archive, Paul Mellon Center, Yale University.


== Family and friends ==
Her husband Ralph Lucas was involved in the design and manufacturing of early motor cars, including the Ralph Lucas Car, developed from 1901 until around 1908. He died in 1955. Their son Colin Lucas (1906-1984) was an architect and a pioneer of reinforced concrete construction. He married the chef Dione Lucas (Wilson) in 1945. Colin Lucas built Noah's Boathouse in Cookham for his parents. Mary Lucas established a music room there, where musical and philosophical gatherings were held. (Mary and Colin were followers of the Russian esotericist P. D. Ouspensky). Participants in these gatherings may have included friends such as Paul Nash, Alain Daniélou and Edmund Rubbra.
