Diana McIntosh (born March 4, 1937 in Calgary, Alberta) is a contemporary Canadian composer and pianist who is based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Hailed by the Canadian Encyclopedia as "a champion of 20th-century Canadian music", she has premiered piano works by such Canadian composers as Peter Allen (Logos, 1977), Norma Beecroft (Cantorum Vitae, 1981), Robert Daigneault (Corridors, Reminiscences, 1977), Alexina Louie (Pearls, 1980), Marjan Mozetich (Apparition 1985), Boyd McDonald (Fantasy, 1974), Jean Papineau-Couture (Les Arabesques d'Isabelle, 1990), Ann Southam (Four Bagatelles, 1964 & Integruities, 1973 & Inter-views, 1975), Robert Turner (Homage to Melville, 1974), and John Winiarz (Vortices, 1977).
