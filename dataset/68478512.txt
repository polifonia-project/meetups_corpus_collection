His debut, 2014's Tangled Up in Plaid,  reached No. 7 on the iTunes comedy chart. It was reviewed positively by critics. Chris Spector of Midwest Record praised Taylor's "punk-rock energy" and said "he's got a sharp wit that really cuts to the bone." Brett Watson of The Serious Comedy Site said "Taylor is an absolute master of misdirection. Many of the punchlines go in directions you will never see coming."His 2018 followup album and video Bummin' with the Devil reached No. 1 on both the Amazon and iTunes comedy charts. Aaron Carnes of the Sacramento News & Review called it an improvement over his debut, saying that Taylor "never rushes a punchline and tells true stories with absurd details."
