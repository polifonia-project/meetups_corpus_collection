Brandon Kyle Saller (born June 24, 1983) is an American singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. He is the lead vocalist, keyboardist and former drummer of the metalcore band Atreyu. He is responsible for the melodic singing found in the band's music. He is the band's primary songwriter, along with guitarist Dan Jacobs. Following Atreyu's hiatus in 2011, Saller focused on his side project Hell or Highwater, where he is the lead vocalist. In 2011, the group released their debut album, Begin Again, in 2011.

== Atreyu ==

At 13, Saller was invited by his older brother Ryan to join a band started by some of his friends, Dan Jacobs and Alex Varkatzas. The three of them formed a street punk band called Retribution, which by 1998, had adapted a heavier sound and changed names to Atreyu after the main character of The Neverending Story. The band signed to Victory Records in 2001 and released 3 albums under the label, Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses in 2002, The Curse in 2004, and A Death-Grip on Yesterday in 2006. The band later joined major label Hollywood Records and released 2007's Lead Sails Paper Anchor and 2009's Congregation of the Damned.  After over 10 years of worldwide success, the band embarked on hiatus, but returned in 2014. They released their sixth studio album, Long Live in 2015.


=== Vocal duties ===
Saller did not sing on the band's 1998 EP, Visions, as he only played drums for the band at that time. Between Visions and  Fractures in the Facade of Your Porcelain Beauty, Saller learned to sing while playing drums and became the band's clean vocalist. On Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses, his vocals were largely confined to choruses, however, as Atreyu's career went on, Saller's vocals would get more and more frequent, and they would become a major part of Atreyu's sound. After the departure of Atreyu vocalist Alex Varkatzas, Saller began performing as the band's primary vocalist. 


== Hell or Highwater ==
Formerly the Black Cloud Collective, Hell or Highwater resulted out of Saller's solo material and eventually became a full band. He is solely the band's vocalist. The band released their debut album, Begin Again, independently on iTunes in 2011. After touring for over a year, the band recouped and released an EP, entitled The Other Side in August 2013.
May 19, 2017 the band released their 2nd LP "Vista". Available on iTunes.
