== Instagram account ==
In 2015, Matsumiya created the Instagram account called "Perv_magnet", where she uploaded sexually harassing and sometimes violently threatening messages that she had received from men over the past ten years. According to Matsumiya, the project was created to highlight the abuse and misogyny that women face online, as well as the racism she faced. However, she received a small amount of criticism from people who claimed that she uploaded the examples to brag about receiving "compliments", an accusation which she denied. In a 2014 interview with Bearded Gentlemen Music, her former Kayo Dot band member Toby Driver alluded to stalkers that she faced.

Matsumiya has a daughter, Kira, born in 2016.
