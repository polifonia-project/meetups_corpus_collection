== Early life ==
Sven Gamsky was born on June 23, 1992, in Oakland, California, and grew up in Moraga, California. He is the youngest of three sons born to Dr. Tom and Berit (Fuglsang) Gamsky, and has two older brothers, Nate and Sam. Sven started playing the guitar when he was in middle school.
All three of the Gamsky brothers became Eagle Scouts. Sven was a part of Moraga Boy Scout Troop 212, in which his service project toward becoming an Eagle Scout involved remodeling a garden area at Donald L. Rheem Elementary School in Moraga. The East Bay Times reported in 2010 upon his achievement of Eagle Scout that "Sven plans to travel and volunteer after high school, and eventually study psychology in college."Sven Gamsky attended Campolindo High School in Moraga, graduating in 2010. While in high school, he played guitar and bass in the band "Shoot for Roots". At the beginning of their senior year, "Shoot for Roots" won a Battle of the Bands competition hosted by the Lamorinda Teen Center. They had initially come to a tie with a band called IceBox Business from rival high school, Miramonte High School, but fans from Campolindo High broke the tie by cheering louder for Gamsky's band with a recording of 116 decibels.


== Career ==
After high school, Gamsky earned money by teaching guitar in the Oakland area and playing with the band Feed Me Jack at jazz clubs, festivals, and orchestra halls. He graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz in 2015, majoring in music with a classical guitar emphasis, and minoring in electronic music.From 2011 to 2016, Gamsky was in the alternative rock/math rock band Feed Me Jack,  which released four albums before disbanding, on good terms, in 2016 for members to individually pursue their careers in music.  The following year Gamsky released his first single, "Vacation", under the stage name Still Woozy, stating that he chose the name because of his spaced-out nature. As Still Woozy, Gamsky has released an EP and several singles, for which Ami Cooks created the album covers, and four music videos, the first of which was released in 2017. Gamsky prefers to release music as soon as possible and will sometimes release a song on the same day he has finished making it.A 2020 tour, which would have had 31 performances starting in May and ending in September, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.On August 13, 2021, he released his debut album "If This Isn't Nice, I Don't Know What Is". It serves as Still Woozy's first studio album, including the singles 'Window', 'Rocky', 'That's Life', and 'Get Down', which had been released prior to the album.
