In 1974, he founded the Schönberg Ensemble. They mainly focused on performing works by the Second Viennese School and the avant-garde. He composed the piece Etude (1983–1985) for the strings of the ensemble.

In 2011, De Leeuw conducted Schoenberg's monumental Gurre-Lieder, which was the realisation of an old ambition of his.

De Leeuw was artistic advisor for contemporary music with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and from 2001 to 2010, he served as artistic leader at the Nederlandse Orkest- en Ensemble-Academie (NJO; Dutch Orchestra and Ensemble Academy).
