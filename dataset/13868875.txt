== History ==


=== 1988–2000: Early years ===
Dresden's zeal for dance music and culture developed early in high school where he frequented local Connecticut dance clubs and befriended The Café's DJ Moby, a local disc jockey. His early experiences at the Café fueled his passion to immerse himself in the culture that would become his career and lifelong obsession. From there, he purchased a pair of Technics SP-1300 pitch controlled CD players and got to work. Dresden quickly cultivated a following due to his simple but effective music policy; play the right track at the right time and only play great songs. His ambitions did not stop with spinning. While he continued to play in the clubs sometimes five nights a week, he became a dance music journalist by day. Dresden was named a reporter to the Billboard dance chart, and he began writing reviews and features for national magazines such as Dance Music Authority, DJ Times and Mixer. Dresden profiled Daft Punk, Paul Oakenfold, Moby, Masters at Work, Todd Terry, Sasha & Digweed, Puff Daddy, BT, Crystal Method, Keoki, Josh Wink, Chemical Brothers, Deep Dish amongst many others. Many of these artists' first American press came through Dresden's journalism efforts.
Dresden's affiliation with respected publications gave him easier access to obscure and unreleased tunes upfront, giving him an edge. He regularly contributed his A&R skills to Promo Only CD's and its "Mainstream Club" "Import Club" and "Alternative Club" series. In addition, he scouted new music for Pete Tong's highly influential Essential Selection radio show on the BBC Radio 1. Through his efforts there, Dresden hipped Pete to some rather large records, many of which became "Essential New Tunes", Tong's method of gauging a guaranteed hit. Dresden's wide knowledge of dance music led to the opportunity to help select songs for Nettwerk Records' popular "Plastic Compilation" series. Dresden has also had a hand in producing compilation CD's and single releases with other independent labels such as Strictly Rhythm, Strictly Hype, 4 Play and Max Music. In addition, he's accredited by his own releases for Strictly Hype's trance offshoot Sunrise; "Trancendence: The First Wave", and the hit packed "Transit". His radio career began with the long running, highly rated "Electro Circus," which aired on Hartford, Connecticut's modern rock station WMRQ-FM from 1996 until 2000. Dresden's radio career continued as music director and on-air personality for grooveradio.com, an internet radio station during the year 2000.


=== 2001–2008: Gabriel & Dresden ===

In 2000 Dave became the Music Director of Swedish Egil's grooveradio.com where he met Pete Tong, who asked him to help find music for the Essential Selection. They met at a party being hosted by grooveradio.com at the Miami Winter Music Conference in March 2001. Josh Gabriel gave Leon Alexander a record, the record was "Wave 3", which Dave then gave to Pete Tong, and he played it on the Essential Selection and also used it for his compilation that same year. Pete gave Dave the opportunity to do a remix of New Order Someone Like You and Dave asked Josh to work on it with him. The two joined forces in 2001 and made a name for themselves by creating numerous remixes for artists as diverse as Tiësto, Paul Oakenfold, Sarah Mclachlan, Way Out West, Annie Lennox, Duncan Sheik, and Jewel (singer).
In 2002 Gabriel & Dresden released their first single "Lament" on Saw Recordings in the United States. The duo released numerous singles and number one Billboard hits like "As the Rush Comes" (as Motorcycle, "Tracking Treasure Down" and "Dangerous Power"; they also released one self-titled studio album together, Gabriel & Dresden which was named as the "2006 Album of the Year" by M8 magazine.The duo won the 2007 and 2008 IDMA award for "America's Best DJ". He has achieved 21 Billboard Dance Chart #1 tracks (remixes and originals) as "Gabriel & Dresden", composed music that has appeared on Fox, HBO, NBC and CBS TV shows. Gabriel & Dresden have their own record label, Organized Nature which is distributed by Armada Music.


=== 2009–2010: Solo years ===
After the break-up of Gabriel & Dresden, Dave collaborated with Chris Cox on a track called "Whole Wide World", which was played on Pete Tong's Essential Selection on April 4, 2008. Dave also worked with Trent Cantrelle on a remix for Serge Devant's cover of the Beloved's "Sweet Harmony". On June 22, Dave opened a set for Tiësto's In Search of Sunrise: North American Summer Tour 2008 in Connecticut. He also co-wrote and co-produced "I've Had Friends" with Morgan Page which was the 4th single from his album Believe (Morgan Page album)
In December 2008, Dresden teamed up with longtime friend and Mephisto Odyssey founder Mikael Johnston to remix Lily Allen's "The Fear" under the new moniker Dresden and Johnston. The new production duo went on to remix a number of artists including Nadia Ali's "Love Story" and Enrique Iglesias's "Tonight (I'm Fuckin' You)", all of which hit the #1 position in Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs Chart. Dresden and Johnston's first original single called "Keep Faith" Featuring Mezo Riccio followed in early 2010 and went to #10 in Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart and top 5 on Sirius radio's BPM (Sirius XM) and Club Phusion. The single featured remixes by fellow producers Morgan Page and Harry Romero.
