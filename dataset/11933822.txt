His debut single, "Before I Knew Better", was released in 2002, the first single from his debut album Wings of a Honky-Tonk Angel. The album received a favorable review from About.com for its neotraditionalist sound. In addition, "Before I Knew Better" won an award from BMI for being among the fifty most played country songs of 2003. However, the second single from Wings of a Honky-Tonk Angel, "Rub Me The Right Way", failed to make Top 40, as did "Just Like Love".
