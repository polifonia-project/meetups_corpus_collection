== Early life ==
Oh Land was born in Copenhagen, the daughter of Bendt Fabricius, an organist (not to be confused with the composer Bent Fabricius Bjerre), and Bodil Øland, an opera singer. She is the great-great-grandchild of Lutheran missionary and ethnographer Otto Fabricius, who published Fauna Groenlandica in 1780, the first zoological observations of Greenland. She is a former student of the Royal Danish and Royal Swedish Ballet schools. However, an injury caused by a slipped disc and spinal fracture put an end to her dancing career, which eventually led her to start making music. She moved to New York City in January 2010 where she lived in the Williamsburg neighbourhood of Brooklyn.
