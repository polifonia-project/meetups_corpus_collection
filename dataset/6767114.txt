In early 2004, Jeremy Dawson invited Carah to sing for Shiny Toy Guns. She remained the female vocalist of this band until the summer of 2008.. Almost immediately after her sudden release from Shiny Toy Guns, her band Versant began to form in Sweden. In a February 2009 interview.

In October of 2018 she was married to Spencer Peterson. The couple welcomed their first child in 2019.
Charnow is straight edge and states to have never drunk, smoked or used recreational drugs.
