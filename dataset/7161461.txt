Thomas Dennis Newman (born 7 May 1943) is an English record producer and musician (rhythm guitar). In 1970 he began working with Richard Branson and helped to found The Manor Studio in Oxford for the nascent Virgin Records.  There, he produced the recording of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells.


== Career ==
In 1968 he played in a band called July whose only album was the eponymous "July" on UK Major Minor and US Epic. Prior to that, he was in a British band called "The Tomcats"who played around London and later in Spain.  In 1966, they recorded at least three EP's on Spanish Philips (436387, 436388 and 436826).
In 1970, Newman began working with Richard Branson and helped build The Manor Studio in Oxford.  It was there he met the 18-year-old Mike Oldfield who lent him a rough demo tape of what would become Tubular Bells.
In November 1973, Newman participated in a live-in-the-studio performance of Tubular Bells for the BBC. It is available on Oldfield's Elements DVD.
Newman released some albums as a solo musician and produced several albums for other artists, most notably Mike Oldfield (Tubular Bells, Tubular Bells II, Heaven's Open).
Reviewing Newman's 1977 Fine Old Tom LP, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): "Tom seems to have recorded this far across the sea in 1975, but more than that even my Anglophile sources can't tell me. Analogies: Dave Edmunds (studiomania and general non-esoteric musical orientation, although Newman isn't interested in overpowering anyone), Ray Davies (vaguely but persistently, for both eccentricity and vocal approach), Eno (more precisely, not only for eccentricity and vocal approach but also for style of smarts, although Newman isn't so blatantly avant-garde). Pretty catchy."Newman also worked with young NWOBHM-bands like Charlie ’Ungry.
