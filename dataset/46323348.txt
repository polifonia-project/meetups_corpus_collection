== History ==
Dail began his musical career with the band Innermeans, a hardcore punk band out of California. In this band, he started off playing guitars. The band would record their debut EP, Innermeans, which was released in 1997. Afterward, the band  disbanded, which according to Dail, was not a dramatic ordeal. With Innermeans disbanded, a majority of the members, including Dail, joined Bloodshed. However, Bloodshed did not continue under that name, instead going under the name Slingshot David, recording an EP.By this point, Dail had gotten to know Andrew Schwab and Randy Torres very well. Project 86 had been an active band prior to Dail joining, with Ethan Luck being the active bassist. Dail replaced Luck after his departure, and helped record on the band's debut album, Project 86. Dail, throughout his career with the band, would be one of the band's most prolific songwriters, alongside Torres, with the pair writing a majority of the songs on Drawing Black Lines and a majority of the material following. In 2001, Dail and Alex Albert of Project 86, Innermeans formed Crash Rickshaw with Joby Harris, a longtime friend of Dail's. They released Crash Rickshaw in 2001. 
Throughout the band's career, Project 86's core lineup would continue working together on the next three records, Truthless Heroes which Atlantic Records released, Songs to Burn Your Bridges By which the band self-released initially, and ...And the Rest Will Follow. At this time, Albert departed from the band. Though Albert remained bandmates with Torres and Dail in Crash Rickshaw, he was no longer involved in Project 86. At this time, Dail joined Starflyer 59, focusing a different genre of music. In his first year with Starflyer 59, he recorded two releases with the band - I Win and My Island.
The same year, Project 86 released their sixth album, Rival Factions. It saw a departure from the typical sound the band had portrayed, taking a much more alternative rock and gothic rock approach, as well as introducing new drummer Jason Gerken. After the album was finished, however, Torres would depart from the band in 2009. Around the same time, Crash Rickshaw releases their second album, which was their final release. Dail wrote and recorded a majority of the band's next album, Picket Fence Cartel, even playing guitar and bass on the album, as well taking demos from Torres. After the album came out, Dail would tour with the band on the Scream the Prayer Tour, which lasted about nine weeks.Following the tour, Dail departed from the band, citing that he had been miserable and stressed for a long time and regretted not leaving when Torres left, who had been his best friend for years. By this time, Neon Horse and Crash Rickshaw had both ended, leaving Dail's only active venture being Starflyer 59.
