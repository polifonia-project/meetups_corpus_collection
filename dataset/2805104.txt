Adam Grossman is the guitarist and singer of the Texas-based Industrial metal band Skrew and the crossover thrash band Angkor Wat, both of which he co-founded with Danny Lohner. After Skrew's demise in the late 1990s, Grossman later joined Ministry on its 2003 album, Animositisomina, where he played rhythm guitar on the track "Animosity." Although he initially intended on touring with Ministry, he decided not to do so.
