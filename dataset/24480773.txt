=== 2011–2013: Every Girl and Cut to... Bridget Kelly ===

In early 2011, Kelly and her production team had approached Frank Ocean to write a song for her debut studio album. The song in question eventually became "Thinking Bout Forever", which Kelly commented; "it's sort of a vulnerable track and I wanted everyone to feel me on it." In July 2011, Roc Nation stated on the official site that Kelly is closing her album up and the first single would be the Frank Ocean-penned "Thinking Bout Forever". On July 28, 2011, Ocean leaked his demo version of the song onto his tumblr account, with the title reading "Thinking Bout You". The song was then promptly taken down by Ocean.Kelly has worked with high-profile producers such as The-Dream, Ne-Yo, Jerry Wonda, James Fauntleroy II, Ryan Leslie, and Shea Taylor for her debut studio album. Prior to the album's release, Kelly released her first extended play (EP), titled Every Girl, on October 19, 2011. Kelly's version of "Thinkin Bout You" found its way onto the EP. Kelly was ultimately fine with Ocean's decision, however she noted that she didn't like how most people thought Ocean's version was the original, and how people assumed her version was a cover version. About the confusion of the track, Kelly stated: "Now that push has come to shove, we're going to let the song have a life of its own. I think it's an amazing, well-written record. Frank Ocean is incredibly talented, I will never say anything against that. But at the same time, you know, he's going to do what he wants to do, he's an artist as well."In August 2012, her debut single "Special Delivery", was released to Urban radio stations. Her second single
"Street Dreamin", features American rapper Kendrick Lamar and was released on May 21, 2013. Both songs were Top 40 hits on the Mediabase Urban Airplay charts. On November 26, 2013, Kelly announced she would be releasing her second EP and revealed her debut album was pushed back to a 2014 release. The EP includes six tracks as well as contributions from Jerry Wonda ("Goosebumps"), Pop Wansel, Sam Dew, Elijah Blake, and Cri$tyle. "I speak a lot about love and my feelings on these songs," said Bridget of the follow-up to her 2011 EP Every Girl. "I speak to those who have been in relationships, the good and the bad, and that in the midst of turmoil, finding something you can smile about." The EP, titled Cut to... Bridget Kelly, includes her debut single "Special Delivery" and was made available as a free download on December 17, via her official website.
