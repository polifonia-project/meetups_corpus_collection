== Career ==


=== Musician ===
Wilson, born in 1974, was raised in the small town of Jasper, Oregon. As a teenager, Wilson was a member of the band Adickdid, which was distributed by several labels including Yoyo Records and Kill Rock Stars.  From there, she went on to Team Dresch, in which she shared singing and songwriting duties with Jody Bleyle.  Shortly after Team Dresch released their second album, Captain My Captain, in 1996, Wilson left the group and released a solo acoustic album entitled Kaia. Her second solo album, Ladyman, featured Team Dresch drummer Melissa York, who would later join Wilson in The Butchies.
In 1998, several songs from Kaia were rerecorded and appeared on the debut album of her newest band, The Butchies.  The Butchies boasted a more pop-oriented rock sound, occasionally delving into acoustic music and even electronic dance tracks.  The group recorded four albums before their break-up in early 2005, when they announced an indefinite "hiatus" on their website and thanked their fans.  The Butchies reunited for a single show that November when all three group members happened to be back in Durham, North Carolina, at the same time.
Wilson has continued to release solo work.  She reunited with Team Dresch for several live shows since 2004.  She occasionally performs as a guitarist in Amy Ray's live band.
Wilson contributed an essay, To All You Genius Future Songwriters, to the 2008 book Rock N' Roll Camp for Girls, which provided advice to aspiring female rock musicians.


=== Business ===
