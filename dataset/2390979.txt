Mats Leven is a Swedish singer, songwriter and producer. Some of his most notable collaborations have been with guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, symphonic metallers Therion and doom metallers Candlemass. In 2011, due to family issues on the part of Firewind's lead singer Apollo, Levén was called in to substitute for the rest of their European tour. He also started touring with Trans-Siberian Orchestra in 2016. In 2019, he released his first solo album under the name Skyblood. 
In 2021 he became a member of the band around the Dutch guitarist 'Ad van den Berg'. The band Vandenberg dates from the 80s.
