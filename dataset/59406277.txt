== History ==
The group was created on August 8, 2015, consisting of several junior high and high school girls who were noted at Stardust Planet for their dance skills. The group's name originates from its concept of "working hard to polish dance skills in order to grab the entertainment world's crown".The group was originally founded without a name and was known simply as "Entertainment Office Section 2 Lesson Place" (芸能２部レッスン場). The name "Crown Pop" was announced during their live debut performance that took place on December 5, 2015 at the "Please Don't Forget Tohoku" event in Sendai.In September 2017, the group announced its first mini-album, Change the World!. The album was sold only at the group's live concerts.After several member changes, the group settled with six members in January 2018: Mita Ibuki, Saho Tanaka, Kaori Yamamoto, Rina, Airi Fujita, and Mia Yuzuki. The first concert with the current line-up of six members was held on January 28, 2018 at Akihabara Zest and was titled Crown Pop New Line-up Announcement Concert (CROWN POP新体制お披露目公演).On May 27, 2018, the group announced its first single, "Real×live", with a song titled "EGO×search" as a coupling track. This, like Change the World!, was only distributed at live concerts.On October 23, 2018, the group released (through Music@Note, a record label created as a collaboration between Tower Records Japan and a pop culture event called @Jam) its first nationally distributed single, "Gogo Yoji goro no Suki Desu" (午後四時ごろの好きです). The single reached number 19 on the Japanese weekly Oricon singles chart.On September 14, 2020, Kaori Yamamoto announced that she will graduate on September 27 at the band's "Solo Birthday" live.


== Musical and lyrical style ==
"Gogo Yoji goro no Suki Desu", the title track of the group's album Change the World!, is a sour-sweet rock song full of teenage racing heartbeats and vacillating emotions.
