Daniel Steward (born October 31, 1977), better known as Danny Boy, is an American R&B/soul singer.


== Career ==
Danny Boy originally signed for a five-year run with Death Row Records by Suge Knight at the age of 16. He made his debut on 1994's Murder Was the Case soundtrack with the R&B track "Come When I Call" (produced by DJ Quik). In 1995, he released his first single titled "Slip N Slide" (produced by Reggie Moore and co-produced by DeVante Swing) with then-unknown artist Ginuwine singing the chorus. The video for the song was shot in Cabo, and also features scenes with 2Pac, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Tha Dogg Pound. Danny is best known for singing the choruses of the 2Pac songs "I Ain't Mad at Cha", "What'z Ya Phone #", "Picture Me Rollin'" and "Heaven Ain't Hard 2 Find" on All Eyez on Me, as well as "Toss It Up" on The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory. He had recorded several albums' worth of music while on Death Row Records, but none were released during his time there.
Danny Boy also made an appearance on Tha Row's soundtrack to Eddie Griffin's Dysfunktional Family and also appeared on American Idol, but was disqualified due to continued Internet promotion by his former label. He is currently working on some projects for his own label, Eclectic Soul Music Group, and resides in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. On April 20, 2010, Death Row Records, under new management, finally released Danny Boy's 1996 debut album It's About Time featuring production by DJ Quik and DeVante Swing.


== Personal life ==
In 2016, Danny Boy announced that he is gay. He has said in numerous interviews that the suicide of a man he had been having an affair with pushed him to come out, and that he wants to be a positive role model for LGBTQ people experiencing shame over their sexuality.
