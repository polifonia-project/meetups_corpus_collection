Nitai Hershkovits (Hebrew: ניתאי הרשקוביץ) (born 21 February 1988) is an Israeli jazz pianist and composer. He is mostly known from collaborating with bassist and composer Avishai Cohen.
His playing on Cohen's Duende was described by critic John Fordham as "somewhat reminiscent of a silky-toned old piano swinger such as the late Hank Jones". His own album, I Asked You a Question, was a collaboration with Rejoicer, an "Israeli beatmaker". On it, Hershkovits plays piano, Fender Rhodes, synthesizers and clarinet, and adds vocals on two tracks, while Rejoicer plays drums and adds programming.
