Stephen Ellis Garrett (November 11, 1974 – February 25, 2008), known professionally as Static Major (and previously known as Static) was an American singer, songwriter, and record producer from Louisville, Kentucky. Garrett was a member of the R&B trio Playa. He was also a songwriter for several artists, including Aaliyah, Ginuwine, Pretty Ricky, and Destiny's Child.


== Career ==
Garrett started his producing career when he signed Swing Mob. He made a breakthrough working with R&B singer Ginuwine, writing and co-producing the song "Pony" which became a major hit and a milestone in both Garrett and Timbaland's careers. Garrett later became a member of the Def Jam group Playa, who were most known for their hit single "Cheers 2 U". Playa released an album of the same name in 1998.
After working with Ginuwine, Garrett assisted in producing songs for Nicole Wray for her 1998 debut album, Make It Hot. He would eventually become the lead songwriter for Aaliyah. His songwriting collaborations with Aaliyah include: "Are You That Somebody?", which was featured in the Dr. Dolittle soundtrack, and the Romeo Must Die soundtrack singles "Come Back in One Piece" and her only Billboard Hot 100 number-one single "Try Again". The songs "More than a Woman", "We Need a Resolution", "Rock the Boat", "Loose Rap" (which he was also featured on), "Extra Smooth", "I Refuse", "Read Between the Lines", "Those Were the Days", and "Never No More" were all featured on her third and final studio album Aaliyah.Garrett collaborated with R&B group Pretty Ricky on their 2005 song "Juicy". He was featured on Lil Wayne's chart-topping 2008 song "Lollipop", which he co-wrote.Garrett once reflected on where his inspiration comes from, saying "I stay in the streets, that's where I draw my inspiration [...] If it can't be played in the hood, then it just doesn't work for me. And nobody can hold me on harmony. My whole aura is not your typical R&B aura."


== Posthumous releases ==
Garrett was featured posthumously on Drake's 2018 song "After Dark", which peaked at number 41 on the Hot 100. He also featured on Jack Harlow's "Love Is Dro" which is largely a reworking of Static's own song, also titled "Love Is Dro", which was released posthumously in 2018.
On December 17, 2021, a new posthumous single from Aaliyah was released, titled "Poison". The song featured The Weeknd, who was credited as a co-writer alongside Garrett and Belly. "Poison" contains vocals recorded by Aaliyah shortly before her death in 2001. Garrett can be heard delivering background vocals.

Garrett died at Baptist Hospital East in Louisville, Kentucky on February 25, 2008 from complications of a medical procedure. The music video for "Lollipop" was dedicated to his memory.
