In 2010, Vasandani received the Downbeat Magazine Critic's Poll for "Rising Star Jazz Vocalist"
In a September 20, 2009, review in The New York Times, Nate Chinen called Vasandani "a jazz singer with good ideas, including some about what a jazz singer can be."In a review of Eyes Wide Open, The Boston Globe suggested that Vasandani is "mature in sound and rich in texture but also possesses enough youthful angst in its lyrical themes to ward off the fogeyism that male vocalists so easily slip into before their time."In an NPR interview that aired in 2011, anchor Michele Norris said, "Every now and again you hear a special voice that makes you sit up and take notice. Sachal Vasandani has that voice".
Slow Motion Miracles (2015) features original compositions, incorporating "an almost undefinable fusion of the best of pop, electronic, and jazz." The album was produced by Michael Leonhart.
