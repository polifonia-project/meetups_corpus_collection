SiIvaGunner () (formerly GiIvaSunner; ) is a non-profit musical parody YouTube group, based mostly around bait-and-switch videos claiming to be "high quality rips" of video game music that are in reality remixes, parodies, and/or mashups, usually incorporating Internet memes.


== Channels and name ==
The original YouTube channel used from January to April 2016 was named GiIvaSunner, named after the former soundtrack ripping YouTube channel GilvaSunner, but spelled with a capital "i" used in place of a lowercase "L" (with the effect of making the channels confusingly similar). Following the termination of their original YouTube channel in April 2016, the name was changed to SiIvaGunner for the new channel (retaining the capital "i").


== Format ==
The SiIvaGunner channel uploads videos in the style of many other video game soundtrack-based YouTube channels; the channel's videos are typically static images, usually of the relevant game's logo, box art or title screen, with a piece of music playing over it. Such videos are intentionally misleading as to trick the viewer into believing they are actual songs from a game's soundtrack. The uploaded songs, however, are instead remixes, mashups, covers, or simple editing jokes. Internet memes and other channel-specific running gags are often incorporated into the rips, such as the intro theme to The Flintstones, 7 Grand Dad, Love Live!'s "Snow halation", and LazyTown's "We Are Number One", among many others.


== Popularity ==
As of May 2021, the channel's more than 16,000 videos have accumulated over 800 million views, and at least 39 of its videos have surpassed 1 million views. The propagation of several internet memes, such as "We Are Number One" remixes and "Yoshi Commits Tax Fraud", has been attributed to some of the channel's videos.
In late 2019, art gallery Gallery Aferro featured an exhibit titled "Elevator Music 6: SiIvaGunner", curated by Juno Zago. An auditory exhibit, it was a collection of SiIvaGunner remixes of classic and new video game music played inside an early-1900s refurbished Otis elevator.
