== Style ==
Koch has developed his own style of chicken picking on the guitar and has taught his method, referred to as hybrid picking. Koch uses a guitar pick held with the index finger and thumb of his right hand to pick the bass notes; he uses his other three fingers to pick the treble strings.
Koch has termed his style of playing "gristle" and has been called the "Gristle King". Gristle is usually instrumental, guitar-driven music that leads to a crescendo of trading solos.
Koch's ability on the guitar has been admired by other guitarists. When guitar pioneer Les Paul had his 100th birthday celebration Koch was invited to play. Two contemporary guitarists had this to say about Greg Koch:
