Parallels was one of Fates Warning's most successful releases due to the commercial success of the singles Eye To Eye, Point of View and We Only Say Goodbye. According to Metal Blade records (2010) Parallels has proven to be one of the most influential albums in the prog and metal genres, despite its hotly debated status among fans as a "commercial" sounding album. Commenting on the album, Ray Alder is quoted on the "Metal Blade Records Website". as follows, "I think it's one of the best albums we ever put out and I'm happy that fans have the chance to take a second look at this important record. The lineup, the songs and the cover art all came together to make a great package when originally recorded and the bonus DVD really adds a fresh perspective to the album."
