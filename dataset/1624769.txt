== History ==
Om's earliest works incorporate musical structures similar to Tibetan and Byzantine chant, as heard on the debut album Variations on a Theme. The band's name itself derives from the Hindu concept of Om, which refers to the natural vibration of the universe. Every album from  Pilgrimage onward features Eastern Orthodox iconography in the cover art.
Om's first three albums feature Al Cisneros on vocals and bass and Chris Hakius on drums.
On December 5, 2007, Om performed in Jerusalem. Their performance lasted for over five hours and a portion of that show was released on 12" vinyl by Southern Lord as Live at Jerusalem.The band's 2007 album Pilgrimage was chosen as Mojo Magazine's "Underground Album of the Year". In that same year, Om famously played two multiple-hour shows, with one show in Jerusalem rumored to last somewhere between four and six hours.On January 31, 2008, Chris Hakius left the band and was replaced by drummer Emil Amos of Grails. On the last tour with Hakius songs that would later become "Gebel Barkal" and "Thebes" were being performed live.
On August 15, 2008, Om released a 7" 45 entitled "Gebel Barkal" for Sub Pop's Singles Club. A live vinyl-only LP, Conference Live, followed in 2009 on Important Records.
