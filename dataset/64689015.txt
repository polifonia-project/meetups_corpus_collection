== Career ==
Beauchamp is often referred to as a dancer because his career started in 2006, since then he is seen as such. Despite his years of dancing, Josh also sings.

Josh was contacted to travel to Los Angeles for Now United auditions.

However, when the project's creator, Simon Fuller learned that Josh was actually Canadian, like his father, he decided to put him in the group to represent his country of origin.
In 2018, he participated in the second season of the American reality competition television series World of Dance in the Junior division along with dancer Taylor Hatala. In 2020, Josh had a small part in Bieber's music video "That's What Love Is" dancing together with dancer Charlize Glass.
