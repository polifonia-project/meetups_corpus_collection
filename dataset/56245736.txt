== Biography ==
Rose Fréart was born in Saint-Riquier. Her father was a sugar industrialist. Shortly after the birth of his daughter, he returned to his hometown of Argenton-sur-Creuse, where Rose Féart spent her entire childhood. She was introduced to music by the organist of Église Saint-Sauveur d'Argenton-sur-Creuse, Anselme Picardeau, who detected the child's vocal qualities. Sent to Paris to continue her musical studies, she won the first prize of the Conservatoire de Musique in lyrical declamation on 2 August 1902, at the age of 24.
Her soprano voice was noticed by the Opéra de Paris who immediately engaged her. Rose Féart became one of the most important opera singers for the great repertoire, especially in Wagnerian roles, and worked with composers of her time such as Massenet, Fauré, Debussy, César Franck, and André Caplet. Her career developed quickly, in operas and concerts, and lasted 20 years, in France and Switzerland as well as in other major opera houses in Europe.
She died in Geneva on 5 October 1954 aged 76.
