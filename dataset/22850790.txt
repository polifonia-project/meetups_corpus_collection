Sanjay Mishra  is an Indian American musician who began performing after completing his studies at the Peabody Conservatory of Music. Mishra plays with an eclecticism well suited to his multicultural background combining both Eastern and Western influences. He has been quoted saying, "I come from a tradition that has a lot of improvisation. Sometimes Western classical music can seem a little rigid, I had to find some middle ground." He plays a nylon string MIDI classical electric guitar. He uses various looping devices and MIDI instruments to create a lush sound.
