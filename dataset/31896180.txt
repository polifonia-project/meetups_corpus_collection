List of the main songsA la joie des oiseaus
L'an ke li dous chans retentist
Au tens gent que raverdoie
Biau m'est quant voi verdir les chans
Douce amours, ki m'atalente
Doulerousement comence
Merci, amors, ore ai mestier
El mois d'esté que li tens rassoage
Quant oi el bruel
Quant oi tentir et bas et haut
Quant li tens torne a verdure
Se li oisiel baisent lor chans
Li tans noveaus et la douçors
Tant ai mon chant entrelaissié
Chanter m'estuet de recomens
