== Early life ==
Long was born in Poteet, Texas, but grew up in Freer where he graduated from high school in 1942. Long served in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1945 before returning to Corpus Christi, Texas to work in a record store. In 1946, Long moved to San Antonio to work for Decca Records. When Long's supervisor left Decca for RCA Records, he followed. While at RCA, Long would meet Colonel Tom Parker, who hired him to do publicity work for Eddy Arnold. It was while he was managing Arnold that Long would move to Nashville and get into the promotional business.

Despite moving to Nashville with Parker, Long would be named manager of the Louisiana Hayride in Shreveport in 1950. While with the Louisiana Hayride, Long would sign both Webb Pierce and Faron Young to management contracts. To help better management his growing list of stars, Long established the Hubert Long Agency in Nashville in 1952 for talent bookings and then the Stable of Stars in 1955 which was one of Nashville's first independent talent agencies.

The following year, Long's business had expanded beyond the United States into the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, South Africa, and several other European countries. By 1964, Long's talent and music publishing businesses were firmly entrenched in Nashville's Music Row, with his office right next to Columbia Records recording studios  (now part of Sony Music Nashville.) Among the stars under his agency included Skeeter Davis, Ray Price, Chet Atkins, Little Jimmy Dickens, Ferlin Husky, Don Gibson, Bill Anderson, Jan Howard, Mel Tillis, and Brenda Lee. Long stated in 1964 that "Business looks good. It certainly looks good to me. I see a continually growing future in this industry and as long we are good to it, it will be good to us." Parker was also given praise from Long in that same article along with adding more space to his rapidly growing business.At the time of his 1972 death, Long also owned an advertising agency and three additional music publishing firms.
