=== 2007–2012: Career beginnings: Tides of Man, Saosin, and Emarosa ===
Tides of Man
In 2007, Pearson formed progressive rock band Tides of Man consisting of lead guitarist Spencer Gill, rhythm guitarist Adam Sene, bass guitarist Alan Jaye, and percussionist Josh Gould, at the time. The band recorded their debut full-length studio album titled Empire Theory throughout September 2008 with producer Matt Malpass and was released through Rise Records on August 4, 2009.

Since Pearson's departure, Tides of Man has become an instrumental and progressive rock band consisting of little-to-no vocal use in their recent material.
SaosinFollowing the announcement of Pearson's departure from Tides of Man in December 2010, the singer revealed that he was working on material with American post-hardcore band Saosin. The band's members Alex Rodriguez and Beau Burchell reached out to Pearson asking him to record a demo to which he agreed and recorded "Promises". In January 2011, Pearson flew to California for rehearsals and decided to record more material with Saosin. He was subsequently offered to record vocals for their third studio album, however Pearson was limited to recording with the group. The album with Pearson never came to fruition due to his commitments to touring with Emarosa and forming his band Archives. Saosin went on to go on an indefinite hiatus, later rejoining with original lead vocalist Anthony Green. In a 2013 interview, Pearson explained why his relationship with Saosin fell through. "They flew me out to California and I did a bunch of practices and recorded five demos. A few months later I came back and did some writing sessions. Time just stretched and stretched after that. It was a complete maybe for almost two years. They would send me demos every few months. During this span I also toured with Emarosa and did a couple months of writing and recording demos with them. It wasn't until I was doing the music video for “Up In the Air” from my solo project when Saosin told me they were probably going to do something instrumental."

EmarosaIn April 2011, American post-hardcore band Emarosa announced the departure of their lead vocalist Jonny Craig. Pearson, who had just left his band Tides of Man, was offered to temporarily tour with the group for the remainder of their 2011 tour dates.
