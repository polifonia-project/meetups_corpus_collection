== Her philosophy ==
She sees the role of a composer in society as a commentator.
She says that her ability to empathise with her subjects brings great emotional depth to her work.  For example, "Global Nation" celebrates a multi-cultural world set into England's "green and pleasant land"; "Ocean Witness" highlights the suffering of whales and dolphins at the hands of Man.  She feels that her creativity allows her to combine her skills of orchestration with those of the MIDI studio programmer/musician. 
She regularly conducts her own work and has conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the BBC Concert Orchestra and the Irish Film Orchestra.
