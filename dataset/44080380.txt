Joe Barbieri (born December 14, 1973, Naples, Italy) is a singer, songwriter, and producer.

Born in Naples, Barbieri started his career in 1993 under the production by Pino Daniele. He was a member of the vocal group Neri per Caso between 2000 and 2002.  He has worked as a songwriter for other artists. Although he started out a pop singer, he moved to a more sophisticated style.
