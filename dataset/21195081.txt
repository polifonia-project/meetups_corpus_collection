Clark and the Lonesome Mountaineers performing at WLVA in Lynchburg, Virginia. In 1934, he formed the Rambling Mountaineers together with banjo player Johnny Whisnant and guitarists Dudley Watson and Ed McMahan. Within a year they played over radio station WHKY in Hickory, North Carolina. It later led to performances at WSPA in Spartanburg, South Carolina and WWNC in Asheville, North Carolina. They recorded for ARC in 1939 and Okeh Records in 1940; however, these recordings were never issued. Story played with Bill Monroe in 1942 as a fiddler - replacing Howdy Forrester who had been drafted - but eventually Story was also drafted in October 1943.After his discharge from the U.S. Navy in 1945, he began reforming and performing with his Rambling Mountaineers on the Mid-Day Merry-Go-Round show at WNOX in Knoxville, Tennessee.
