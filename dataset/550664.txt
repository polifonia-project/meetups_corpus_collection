Jeordie Osbourne White (born June 20, 1971), once known professionally as Twiggy Ramirez, shortened to just Twiggy since 2008, and sometimes referred to by his real name, is an American musician, mostly known as the former bassist and guitarist of the band Marilyn Manson. Previously, he was the bassist for A Perfect Circle and a touring member of Nine Inch Nails, and is currently the vocalist for Goon Moon. He left Marilyn Manson in 2002, later rejoined the band in 2008, and was dismissed in 2017. He has been a principal songwriter for the band and has also contributed to some of the Desert Sessions recordings.  He also hosts the Hour of Goon podcast with fellow musician Fred Sablan, on the Feral Audio network.


== Early life ==
Born in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey, he moved to Florida during his childhood. He has an older brother, James. He did not know his father for most of his life but united with him in 2008 (which was mentioned in the Love Line radio interview in 2008).
Influenced by the likes of Mötley Crüe, Van Halen and Iron Maiden, he first picked up a guitar at age thirteen. Although a New Jersey native, he spent the better portion of his youth in the Fort Lauderdale area, where he quickly embraced South Florida's growing music scene and, by age 15, had joined his first band, The Ethiopians.


== Musical career ==
Early in his career, White was in a speed metal cover band called The Ethiopians covering songs such as Metallica's "Trapped Under Ice". Between 1989 and 1993, White played rhythm guitar and provided backing vocals for Amboog-a-Lard.


=== (1993–2002; 2008–2017) Marilyn Manson ===
White met Brian Warner on numerous occasions in the late 1980s. After an unexpected meeting at a used records store in the Coral Springs Mall where White was working, the two realized they had much in common, but had yet to work on a musical endeavor. White actively attempted to join Manson's band while playing in another project. He became an honorary spooky kid, and went by the groupie name Gordy White. In March 1993, White took part in Manson's side project Mrs. Scabtree and shared vocal duties with then girlfriend Jessicka. Jeordie did not join Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids until Gidget Gein was ejected from the band by the manager in December 1993. White was given the Manson band member name Twiggy Ramirez, which was derived by taking the first name from English supermodel Twiggy and the surname from American serial killer Richard Ramirez. White never played bass until Manson bought him his first instrument right after he joined Manson's band. In 1998, White made a cameo in Monster Magnet's music video for "Space Lord". In 2001, White appeared on an MTV Cribs episode: the "Ozzfest Edition".
As a result of many lineup changes (specifically guitarists), White was largely responsible for most of the songwriting on the albums Antichrist Superstar, Mechanical Animals and Holy Wood; for the latter album, he shared credits with John 5. In 2007, White said that he is proud of the work that he did in the band.On January 9, 2008 Marilyn Manson posted a bulletin on MySpace confirming that Tim Skold was leaving Marilyn Manson and that White had rejoined the band in his place. He toured with Manson as the band's new guitarist in support of their seventh studio album. However, he stayed with Goon Moon after the touring of The High End of Low finished.
White also mentioned in an interview that he would keep working with Manson for their next album, Born Villain, which was released on May 1, 2012. While he didn't participate in the writing or recording of Marilyn Manson's 2015 album, The Pale Emperor, he continued to tour with the band. Manson confirmed on Reddit that he intends on collaborating with White for the follow-up to The Pale Emperor. Despite this, the band's latest album, Heaven Upside Down, features no contributions from White.
On October 24, 2017 Marilyn Manson posted on Facebook that the band parted ways with White following allegations of sexual misconduct made against him, and announced that there will be a replacement for the upcoming tour.


=== (2003–present) Other projects ===
After departing Marilyn Manson, White played two live shows with California punk metal band Mondo Generator, and auditioned for the role of second guitar in Queens of the Stone Age, which he lost to Troy Van Leeuwen of A Perfect Circle. He also auditioned for a spot as bass player (after Jason Newsted's departure) in Metallica, but lost out to former Suicidal Tendencies/Ozzy Osbourne bassist Robert Trujillo, which is documented briefly in their film, Metallica: Some Kind of Monster.
Several months later, White replaced Paz Lenchantin in A Perfect Circle, the project of Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan and former Tool guitar tech Billy Howerdel as a full member of the band on bass guitar. White later joined Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme on the ninth and tenth volumes of Homme's music project The Desert Sessions. He contributed to Melissa Auf der Maur's solo debut and second solo album Out of Our Minds. He toured with Nine Inch Nails in support of their album With Teeth, from 2005–06 and then again in 2007 for Year Zero.
White has composed for a range of artists from fictional band Steel Dragon to Bif Naked to his namesake, model Twiggy Lawson with whom he recorded and produced a duet of Dusty Springfield's "I Only Want To Be With You" for the soundtrack of the MTV film Dead Man on Campus. In 2005, White worked with Goon Moon and with them released the EP I Got a Brand New Egg Layin' Machine, recorded at Rancho De La Luna, Prescription and Regime Studios. The band released their first full-length album "Licker's Last Leg" in May 2007. White appeared on the UNKLE album War Stories playing bass and synths on the track "Burn My Shadow".
'
White was invited to return to play with A Perfect Circle for their Fall and Winter 2010 Tour in North America, but ultimately did not participate in the reunion and was permanently replaced by Matt McJunkins.


== Personal life ==
White cites Oasis, The Who, The Kinks and the Bee Gees as his influences and as his favorite bands.
White has a Don't Believe the Truth tattoo as a tribute to Oasis on his left arm. Due to his friendship with Oasis producer Dave Sardy, White got to play bass on a new version of Oasis' "Cast No Shadow" that was submitted to the soundtrack for the 2005 movie Goal!, and contributed remixes of "I'm Outta Time" and "Falling Down" that the band used as b-sides.
It has been emphasized by White personally that if there was one single piece of information the public should know about him it would be that he smells like baby powder.White has been married to model and makeup artist Laney Chantal since July 26, 2014. Dee Snider who officiated their wedding stated during another wedding that the couple are now divorced.


=== Rape accusation ===
On October 21, 2017, White's ex-girlfriend Jessicka Addams, lead singer of the band Jack Off Jill, published a Facebook post accusing White of rape, as well as physical and emotional abuse throughout their five year relationship, from 1992 to 1997. White issued a statement following the allegations: "I have only recently been made aware of these allegations from over 20 years ago. I do not condone non-consensual sex of any kind. I will be taking some time to spend with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety. If I have caused anyone pain I apologize and truly regret it."
