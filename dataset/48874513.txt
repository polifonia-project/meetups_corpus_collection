Initially Thurgur joined Khan's Afro-Latin Jazz group 'The Bonobo Orchestra', then in 1999 they formed the Cuban-Funk outfit 'Motimba' together. Currently Thurgur is working with Khan in the pianist's Bangla/Latin/Afro/Jazz project 'Lokkhi Terra' and in Thurgur's Afro-Jazz group. His album for this project 'No Confusion' was released in July 2016 on their label 'Funkiwala', which was also officially launched in July.

In 2010 Khan and Thurgur went to Cuba to record an album in Egrem Studios with Indian percussionist Pandit Dinesh and various Cuban artists, including Giraldo Piloto, Julito Padron and Changuito.Thurgur has been collaborating with Dele Sosimi since 1998, first in the group Gbedu Resurrection and then in Sosimi's Afro-Beat Orchestra.

Sosimi's fourth album, 'You No Fit Touch Am', was released with Wah Wah 45's in 2015.
