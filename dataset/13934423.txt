== Football career ==
Fields was a dual-threat wide receiver for Penn State from 1996 to 1999, where he ranks 10th on the all-time receiving list, with 88 catches for 1,437 yards. He is perhaps best known for his electrifying 84-yard double reverse in Penn State's 38-15 win over Texas in the 1997 Fiesta Bowl. Fields went undrafted in the 2000 NFL Draft despite a superb performance in the 2000 Senior Bowl, due to concerns about a nagging ankle injury. He spent a season each with the San Francisco 49ers, the Denver Broncos, and the New York Jets who released him prior to the 2002 regular season.  He never played in a regular season or postseason NFL game.
Fields earned his Bachelor of Science in Human Development and Family Studies from Penn State in 1999. He attended Mastbaum Area Vocational/Technical School, in Philadelphia where he was named All-America by SuperPrep magazine, Blue Chip Illustrated and USA Today.
