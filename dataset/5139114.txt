== Biography ==
Laboriel was born in Mexico City. His brother was Mexican rock singer Johnny Laboriel, and his sister is Mexican singer, film and television actress Ella Laboriel. Their parents were Garifuna immigrants from Honduras. His father Juan José Laboriel started as a cab driver but in the 1920's became an integral part of the entertainment business in Mexico as a founding member of the actor's, musician's, composer's and film worker's associations, eventually becoming involved in over 200 films in various capacities. A classically trained guitarist, he switched to bass guitar while studying at the Berklee College of Music, graduating in 1972. It was during this time that Laboriel learned the importance of versatility as a musician. Henry Mancini encouraged Laboriel to move to Los Angeles, California, to pursue a recording career, which he did in 1976. He struggled to find work for two years, before finding his first gig on a road tour with Olivia Newton-John.
