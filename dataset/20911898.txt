Christopher Clay Austin (born February 24, 1964 â€“ March 16, 1991) was an American country music singer. Austin was signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988 and charted three singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. His highest-charting single, "Blues Stay Away from Me," was included on the 1989 compilation album New Tradition Sings the Old Tradition. Austin also co-wrote Ricky Skaggs' 1991 single "Same Ol' Love."
Austin was most known for playing guitar and fiddle for Ricky Skaggs's and Reba McEntire's road bands. Austin toured with McEntire until an airplane carrying Austin, six other members of McEntire's band, and her road manager crashed into a nearby mountain after taking off from an airport in San Diego, California, killing all on board.
