== Biography ==
Kivy received a B.A. summa cum laude at the University of Michigan in 1956, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He earned a M.A. in philosophy in 1958 also from the University of Michigan, an A.M. in musicology  at Yale University in 1960, and a PhD in philosophy from Columbia University in 1966. He joined the faculty at Rutgers the following year, and became full professor in 1976. He taught there for his whole career except one year as a visiting professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.
His early work was on the 18th-century British aesthetics, primarily Francis Hutcheson. From the late 1970s on, he had been interested mainly in philosophy of music. His book The Corded Shell made him a central figure in musical aesthetics. One preoccupation of his had been the problem of what it means for instrumental music to "express" an emotion. His answer is that common emotions have physical behavioral expression in people that can be understood by appearance and imitated in music; thus, music cannot express more complex emotions that do not have an obvious behavioral expression. A similar position is developed independently by Stephen Davies.Some criticism of Kivy's ideas is available in Music, Philosophy, and Modernity (2007) by Andrew Bowie and Filosofía de la Música.
