Separated from her sisters when she was a toddler, Mae, when she was five, was adopted by German-born Chicagoans, Paul Wilhelm Doelling (1846-1909) and Ida B. Doelling (née Ida B. Wolff; 1852–1911) – who both immigrated to the United States in 1882. He was a cigar maker.  Paul and Ida Doelling also adopted Paula Hoffman in 1891.

At the age of 9, Doelling began studying in the Children's Department of the American Conservatory of Music, where at age 10 she earned a Silver Medal and at age 12, a gold medal. At age 14, she entered the Royal Conservatory of Music at Dresden where she studied with Laura Rappoldi (née Laura Kahrer; 1853–1925), a former student of Liszt, Adolf von Henselt, and Hans von Bülow.

She was a member of the Zukovsky Trio, with Alexander Zukovsky (1880–1942) (violin) and Theodore du Moulin (1888–1978) (cello). A 1922 report described Doelling as "forceful when necessary", but adding that "she relies on brains rather than physical strength to bring out the beauties of the music." She often included her own compositions in her programs. Her piano compositions included "Two Studies" (1922), "Venetienne" (1939), "Swiss Music Box" (1939), "Romance" (1939), "Tarantella for 2 solo pianos."Mae Doelling Schmidt taught piano at the American Conservatory of Music.
