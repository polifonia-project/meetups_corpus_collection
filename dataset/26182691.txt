=== 1993–1999: The Original Evergreen ===
Jones was part of the South African rap band The Original Evergreen, which were signed to Sony Music. He released one single with the group, 'Puff the Magik', which was banned from radio for its controversial lyrics about marijuana usage. In 1996, after the track would later win a SAMA music award for Best Rap Album award, he left to release a solo album under Chameleon Records and later form Max Normal. The Band released Burn The Evidence in 1997, which caused more notoriety in the South African music scene.

The album was to be released on the Sheer Sound label, but it caused such uproar in the South African press due to the contents of its lyrics that Sheer Sound was forced to withdraw it and was the final chapter in The Original Evergreen story as it resulted in the band splitting up. The album 'Addictive Personalities' was released in a limited run by Melt 2000 in 1999.

The band released their debut album $O$ in 2009. It was made freely available online and attracted international attention for their music video "Enter the Ninja". They briefly signed with Interscope Records, and left after pressure from the label to be more generic. du Toit explained that Interscope "kept pushing us to be more generic" in order to make more money: "If you try to make songs that other people like, your band will always be shit. You always gotta do what you like. If it connects, it's a miracle, but it happened with Die Antwoord.". They formed their own independent label, Zef Recordz and released their second album Tension through it.They have since released 2 other albums; Donker Mag in 2014, and Mount Ninji and da Nice Time Kid in 2016.

== Controversy ==
In March 2019, Australian musician Zheani Sparkes released a diss track titled "The Question" detailing an alleged sexual assault on her by Jones in South Africa in 2013. Sparkes claimed that Jones drugged her, as well as human traffick[ed] her to Africa, and sent sexually explicit photos of her to cast members of Chappie. She jokingly claims that he also expressed having an active interest in her because of her resemblance to his now teenage daughter, Sixteen Jones, who in 2013 was only 8 years old. The music video for the track features Sparkes rapping on a rooftop accompanied by screenshots of texting threads, handwritten notes, and photographs from Jones, which she claims, supports the allegations and connections to Die Antwoord. The allegations have not been proven.
A conflict between Die Antwoord and Sparkes ensued on social media afterwards, where Jones accused Sparkes of catfishing him. In September 2019, Sparkes filed a police report in Queensland, Australia formalizing her accusations of sexual assault and revenge porn, which she failed.Italian-American singer Dionna Dal Monte also accused Jones of sexual assault, which she claimed occurred at a Die Antwoord show in 2014.In 2019, a video from 2012 surfaced, showing Jones and Die Antwoord bandmate Yolandi Visser fighting Hercules and Love Affair founder Andy Butler while calling him insults, such as "faggot". Butler openly identifies as gay. After fighting him, Visser and Jones alert security staff, and, while crying, Visser claims she was sexually assaulted by Butler. Later on in the video, Jones tells her that her performance was "Oscar-winning".Jones responded on Facebook, claiming that the person who filmed the video edited it to make it seem like he and Visser were in the wrong. He mentions that Butler harassed them in the days leading up to the fight, and that it had nothing to do with him being gay. Jones also claimed that he told Visser to act as "dramatic as possible" about what Butler did to avoid getting detained by security after the fight.Die Antwoord and Butler were subsequently dropped from the lineup of several upcoming festivals due to this.
