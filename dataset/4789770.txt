== Biography ==
Born and raised in Edmonton, Alberta, his father was Teddy Pemberton, a pioneering hip hop DJ on CJSR-FM, and his grandfather was Rollie Miles, a football player for the Edmonton Eskimos. He began rapping at age 13, and following high school he briefly attended journalism school, dropping out soon afterward to concentrate on music. He released the mixtape Cadence Weapon Is the Black Hand in 2005, and his full-length debut Breaking Kayfabe at the end of the year.
Breaking Kayfabe garnered strong reviews in Canadian, American and British media, and Cadence toured extensively to support the disc, including concerts across Canada and three shows in Austin, Texas at the 2006 South by Southwest festival. Chart magazine named Cadence Weapon one of the 15 Canadian artists to watch in 2006. In addition, the composite review site Metacritic listed Breaking Kayfabe as one of the best albums of 2006.Cadence described his inspiration to pursue a career in music: "It was around me all the time when I was growing up, my dad was a DJ and he would play all sorts of stuff around the house, Hip hop, electro, funk and my mum would play piano. And I suppose I just randomly got into rapping. I remember rapping in math class, I failed maths, but I suppose I did OK in other things." Cadence has said that he is inspired by dance music: "I'm a big Basement Jaxx fan. I like the way their music sounds, really like it's a party happening. It sounds really organic and super-tech. Switch. Obviously Daft Punk. I'm into very European stuff. I like some of the Ed Banger stuff. Dubsided Records." In addition to his own recordings, Cadence Weapon has also remixed tracks for Lady Sovereign and Ciara, and has written hiphop reviews for Stylus Magazine and Pitchfork Media.
Cadence Weapon was nominated for the 2006 Polaris Music Prize, which awards $20,000 for the Canadian album of the year. However, he lost to Owen Pallett's He Poos Clouds.  Coincidentally, the Toronto alternative newspaper Eye Weekly's cover photograph the Thursday before the award was presented featured both Cadence and Pallett adopting a mock confrontational pose. The accompanying article, in fact, revealed that Cadence and Pallett had become friends and both really admired each other's records. Cadence and Pallett also performed together on the CBC Radio concert series Fuse in April 2007. He has also been a guest performer on music by other artists, including Super Extra Bonus Party's "Radar" and Shout Out Out Out Out's "Coming Home".On February 21, 2007, Pemberton announced that he signed an American record deal with Epitaph Records sublabel ANTI-, a move that would give him greater exposure in the United States. As a part of his new deal, Breaking Kayfabe was released in the US on March 13, 2007. In the fall of 2007, Big Dada became Cadence Weapon's representative label in Europe. Cadence Weapon's second LP, Afterparty Babies was released by Anti-/Epitaph on March 4, 2008. In 2008, he also played at ZXZW in the Netherlands.On May 26, 2009, Cadence Weapon was sworn in as Edmonton's Poet Laureate for a two-year term beginning July 1, 2009, and as such served as an ambassador of the literary arts, as well as creating original works.In 2011, he participated in the National Parks Project, collaborating with musicians Laura Barrett and Mark Hamilton and filmmaker Peter Lynch to produce and score a short film about Alberta's Waterton Lakes National Park.Cadence Weapon released the album Hope in Dirt City on May 29, 2012. The album became his third straight to be nominated for the Polaris Music Prize, and second to make the short list. Moreover, the National Post's Jesse Kinos-Goodin and Noah Love described how Drake may be Canada's most commercially successful rapper, but Cadence Weapon is certainly one of the most creative. Hope in Dirt City was short listed as one of their best of albums so far of 2012.In 2015, Cadence Weapon began a residency on Toronto Independent Radio Station TRP called Allsorts.His album Parallel World won the 2021 Polaris Music Prize.


== Personal life ==
Pemberton was based in Montreal for a period of six years in his twenties, which led to collaborations with artists such as Blue Hawaii and Jacques Greene. In 2015, Pemberton relocated to Toronto, which provided inspiration for his 2018 song, "High Rise," that addresses gentrification.
