== Life and career ==
He had been gigging with his dad since he was 5 years old and majored in vocals at the New England Conservatory of Music. He dropped out of school to pursue a professional musical career.Sheehan met Sib Hashian and that led to his role playing bass in Boston shortly after the band signed a recording contract in 1976.  Following the departure of other original members of the Boston line-up, Sheehan was let go from the band midway through the sessions for Boston's Third Stage album in the early 80s (he did receive a songwriting credit for "Cool the Engines").  After leaving Boston, Sheehan (along with two other ex-band members) sued Tom Scholz, before settling out of court.After leaving the band, Sheehan made several guest appearances, including Hallelujah with Sammy Hagar and The Waboritas.
In August 2007, Sheehan, along with other previous members of the band, appeared on stage at the Brad Delp Tribute Show held at the Bank of America Pavilion in Boston.Sheehan had to stop playing bass professionally temporarily after he injured his hand in a biking accident. However, he has recovered and still plays professionally.
On February 25, 2012, Sheehan played with Boston bandmate Barry Goudreau on stage outdoors for a three-hour benefit concert in Florida at the "All Star Jam for the Sydney and Berne Davis Art Center in Fort Myers, Florida.
