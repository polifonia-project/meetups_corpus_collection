The video for Automatic (2013) features a slideshow of images put together by Shirt, as does the video for Bengal Tiger (2014). Cuba (2015) is a work of video assemblage which appears to be inspired by Walter Benjaminâ€™s Arcades Project. In Queens To Hollywood (2015), Shirt appropriates footage from the artist Seth Price.

In February 2020, Shirt performed the work The Fine Art of Rap (2020) at Royal College of Art in London.


== Art practice ==


=== Approach ===
Much of Shirt's visual work makes allusions to and shares concerns with minimalism and post-minimal art, but with added Duchampian references to Black and Brown people in American society.


=== Clothing ===
Shirt has designed conceptual clothing lines, including, in 2015, a t-shirt he made combining the Nike and Adidas logos which resulted in Nike sending him a cease and desist letter. He did not stop producing the unofficial collaboration line, instead making embroidered and accessory items and releasing limited pieces available free inside Nike and Adidas flagship stores in NYC. Jeff Staple called the project "genius."


=== Internet art ===
On February 6, 2014, Shirt "faked the NY Times," linking his audience to the website nytimes.la, a now-defunct website designed by the artist to mirror the real New York Times site. The front page linked to an article on Shirt, "Let Me Break Down The Scene in The City For You," purported to have been written by NY Times hip-hop music editor Jon Caramanica. When word spread that the website was a fake and actually an artwork, it went viral, spawning several real press hits.
