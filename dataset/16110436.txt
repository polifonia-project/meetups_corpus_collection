He directed the play Opinião and performed on violão for it in 1964, contributing to the growth of música popular brasileira (MPB). He worked as a producer for Eumir Deodato, Edu Lobo, and Nara Leão and as a composer with Nelson Motta. He and Motta were an effective songwriting duo. Their song "Saveiros" won a national competition. "O Cantador" was covered by Sarah Vaughan and Natalie Cole, while "Festa" was covered by Sérgio Mendes.He worked as guitarist and arranger for Paul Winter's band and toured with him in the U.S. He arranged albums by Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa, and Gilberto Gil.

In 1989, he moved to Los Angeles, California.His album Cinema: A Romantic Vision (Zebra, 1999) received a Latin Grammy Award nomination for his arrangement of The Pink Panther theme by Henry Mancini.Influências was nominated for a Latin Grammy for Best Contemporary Brazilian album in 2001.
