Cavallo has made various claims about his life and origins. At times, he has claimed to have been born in 1924 to Sicilian parents living in Brooklyn, at other times he has said that he is an extraterrestrial from the planet Strazar. Cavallo has cited Bill Haley & His Comets and Jerry Lee Lewis as being particularly inspirational for his music.In the 1990s, Cavallo collaborated with the San Francisco Bay Area bands Monoshock and OATS.

In 1994, Foetus released a cover of Cavallo's song "Outside of Time" on the single Vice Squad Dick.Julian Cope is a notable admirer of Cavallo's music, which he has called a work of genius. He has written a rave review of the album Red Resistor on his website.Suicide front-man Alan Vega described his admiration of Cavallo, writing "Red Transistor... Von LMO sang and played guitar and Rudolph Grey was on guitar or bass and it was total insanity. Von LMO was a nut, a great nut. I was afraid to be in the same room as him. One night they played at Max's and everyone was too afraid to sit up front as they smashed guitars and things were flying all over the place. I went into the front room in fear of my life and tried to get everyone to come with me. Nobody came with me because it was such an intense show."
