Tucker called the article a "pain in the ass", saying "We weren't asked about our personal lives in the interview. We talked about things we thought were really important, and what they printed was that we dated. It just came out as being gossip." Tucker wrote the Sleater-Kinney song "One More Hour" about her breakup with Brownstein.Tucker married filmmaker Lance Bangs in June 2000 in Iceland.
