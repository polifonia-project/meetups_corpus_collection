She recorded a version of "The Bed You Made for Me", later a top 5 hit for Highway 101 in 1987.In mid-2011, Hodges signed to Show Dog-Universal Music and released his debut single, "Hunt You Down", which he co-wrote with Rivers Rutherford and Mark Collie. Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song four stars out of five, saying that it had an "infectious melody" but criticizing the lyrics for being "too cool for the room". Kyle Ward gave an identical rating at Roughstock, also saying that the song had an original sound, although he thought that the "story is a bit implausible" and said that he did not understand the song's bridge. Hodges' debut album includes eleven songs, nine of which he co-wrote. "Goodbyes Made You Mine" and "Sleepy Little Town" also charted from it.
