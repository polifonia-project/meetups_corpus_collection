Shortly after relocating to Atlanta, Sarai signed a record deal with Epic Records. She thus became the first white female rapper to be represented by a major U.S. label. In 2001, she was prominently featured on the single "Same Ol' Same Ol' (remix)" by label-mate P.Y.T., and appeared in the group’s music video, as well as a second remix on their album. "It's Official," a track from her debut The Original, also appeared as a hidden snippet track on their debut album.
In 2002, Sarai's "Pack Ya Bags" was released to radio and as a single. It debuted on the R&B/Hip-Hop charts at #90. Soon after, her record label briefly dubbed her Feminem in an attempt to draw comparisons between her and fellow artist Eminem.
In 2003, "Ladies" was released as a single to radio stations, landing on Billboard's Mainstream Top 40 chart at #28. It peaked at #19, and stayed on the chart for 11 weeks. A video of the song was also released.Her song The Original was released on July 29, 2003. The album entered the Billboard 200 chart at #187. The album featured production from Ali Dee Theodore, Scott Storch, Beau Dozier, and many others. The album lacked promotion by Epic Records, causing it to go under the radar of many.
