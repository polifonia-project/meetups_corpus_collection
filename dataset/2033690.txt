== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Mick Brown was born in San Mateo County, California on September 8, 1956 and began playing drums at age 8 when on his birthday he took his first drum lesson from Mickey Hart (who three years later joined the rock band The Grateful Dead.)


== Career ==


=== Dokken ===
Mick Brown joined Dokken in 1981. He replaced Gary Holland, who left Dokken to join Dante Fox and later Great White. Before that Brown played drums in The Boyz (1975-1977) and then in Xciter (1977-1981). Both bands also featured future Dokken bandmate George Lynch.
He sang vocals on the track "Tooth and Nail" on Dokken's live acoustic album, released in 1995, entitled One Live Night.
Apart from Don Dokken, Brown is the only person to appear on every Dokken album. Brown is credited on Broken Bones, but Jimmy Degrasso played on the record, not Brown.  In July 2019 Brown said he was taking a break from touring and playing live.


=== Ted Nugent ===
Around 2003 in a conversation with Ted Nugent, former Nugent lighting designer Will Twork mentioned that Brown would be the perfect addition to Nugent's band after Nugent had heard about Brown from then-bass player Barry Sparks. Twork had worked with Brown on the first Lynch Mob tour, as well as on the 1995 Dokken "Reunion Tour" in Japan. "Mick is an awesome drummer and personality and perfect for Nugent", said Twork in 2015. In 2006 Brown played drums for Nugent on Nugent's Unleash The Beast Tour, and in 2013 Brown played drums for Nugent on Nugent's Mid-west Rock-n-Roll Express 2013 Tour.


=== Tooth And Nail ===
Brown is also a member of T&N (band), a band that features classic era Dokken members George Lynch and Jeff Pilson. Their debut album "Slave To The Empire" was released October 31, 2012. The band has also been renamed T&N.
Brown also had a solo band called The Bourbon Ballet, with lead singer Scott Hammons from the band Tunnel.
