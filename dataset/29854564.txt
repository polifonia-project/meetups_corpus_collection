Linda Hargrove (married name Bartholomew, born Tallahassee, Florida February 3, 1949 – October 24, 2010, Tallahassee, Florida) was an American country songwriter and musician. She wrote many country music hits for a variety of artists and had a respectable career for herself in the mid-1970s. She was known as "The Blue Jean Country Queen" because she usually performed in jeans and without the elaborate makeup that other female country performers of the time used. After marrying and undergoing a religious conversion, she made two gospel albums in the 1980s. She put out her final album in 2005.
