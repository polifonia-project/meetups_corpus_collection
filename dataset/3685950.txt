Todd Schofield (May 15, 1971 – October 27, 2018), known as Todd Youth, was an American guitarist, best known for his work with Warzone, Murphy's Law and Danzig.


== Biography ==
Schofield was born and raised in Passaic County, New Jersey and began playing in several New York City hardcore bands at a young age, leading to the nickname, Youth. He debuted with Agnostic Front in 1983 but did not play on any recordings. Youth also played for New York City act Warzone until around 1986. He joined Murphy's Law (another New York City band) that year, recording on various works with them, including three full-length albums. Youth performed with Murphy's Law until 1995.After leaving Murphy's Law, he recorded a single with a band named The Homewreckers in 1996. Around this time Youth evolved his style from hardcore to implementing some of his 1970s punk influences, such as New York Dolls, Dead Boys and The Heartbreakers, thus he joined famous New York City glam punk band D Generation, replacing Richard Bacchus on guitar. He was with D Generation from 1996 to 1998 and recorded on their album Through The Darkness, and Youth co-wrote the track "Sunday Secret Saints" with Jesse Malin.
Chrome Locust was formed by Youth, D Generation drummer Michael Wildwood, and Vásquez bassist Jim Heneghan in 1998. On May 25, 1999 Chrome Locust released a self-titled album on Tee Pee Records. The cover art was reminiscent of The Age Of Quarrel by Cro-Mags. In a late interview, Youth stated that The Age Of Quarrel by Cro-Mags was one of the best hardcore records ever released. Youth disbanded Chrome Locust in order to audition for Danzig, despite having a potential offer to tour with The Hellacopters. Youth was also contacted to audition for Foo Fighters during this period. He stated that his decision to audition for Danzig, instead of Foo Fighters, had to do with having more fun on tour and the chance to work with Joey Castillo, who was also from the hardcore punk rock scene, having played with Wasted Youth.


=== Playing with Danzig and Samhain ===
During the summer of 1999, he successfully auditioned for Danzig; he joined as the guitarist. Coincidentally, former D Generation bandmate, bassist Howie Pyro, joined Danzig soon after. The same year Glenn Danzig had reformed his horror punk band Samhain, guitarist Damien decided not to join the band for their reunion tour, thus Todd was asked to replace him.
Youth only had three months to practice and learn the Samhain and Danzig sets. Although not an original member of Samhain, fans welcomed him to the lineup, some even mistaking him for Damien. The band AFI had toured with Samhain during 1999, and their frontman Davey Havok was a longtime fan, so in 2000 Youth, along with Samhain members London May and Steve Zing masterminded horror punk band Son of Sam,.This featured Davey Havok on vocals and on their album Songs from the Earth with guest appearances from Glenn Danzig.
With Danzig, Youth recorded the studio album, I Luciferi, released in 2002, which featured Glenn Danzig, Howie Pyro and future Queens of the Stone Age drummer Joey Castillo. Todd's guitar work was also included on the live album, Live on the Black Hand Side, released in 2001 and the compilation record, The Lost Tracks of Danzig, released in 2007. Youth left the group in 2003 but kept in contact with Glenn Danzig through the years. He rejoined Danzig in 2007 for the Halloween Tour. He left Danzig again, to join Glen Campbell's band. Youth stated that his father, who also was a musician, was overjoyed to hear about his opportunity with Campbell, which he considered to be Todd's big break in the music business.
