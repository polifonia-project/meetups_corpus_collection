His mother was born in a Japanese internment camp. Jablonsky went to the University of California, Berkeley for college. He studied computer science at the beginning, but switched to music composition a year later. After graduation, he became an intern at Hans Zimmer's Remote Control Productions, after cold calling the studio to ask if they needed any help. During that time, Jablonsky met Harry Gregson-Williams, a fellow composer of Zimmer, and started working as his assistant. Later he became more engaged with Zimmer and started composing for works such as Desperate Housewives and the Transformers film series.
