Gotee Records manager TobyMac discovered her music while visiting Jamaica, and Woods was eventually signed onto the record label.

The album's single "Happy" garnered popularity on Christian radio in the U.S., and Woods received a Dove Award nomination in 2007, as well.

== Early life and family ==
Ayiesha Woods was born on July 2, 1979, in Long Island, New York. She has lived in a variety of locations, including Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, and Texas; she spent a portion of her childhood growing up in Bermuda, as well. Woods was surrounded by music while growing up, and was the granddaughter of a professional musician. Throughout high school she sang in chorus and played in the school's band, sang harmony in her church choir, and learned to play instruments such as the guitar, keyboard and percussion.


== Musical career ==
In 2003, Ayiesha Woods wrote and recorded an independent album, What You Do to Me, which was released in 2004. In 2004, she was the first female musician to receive the "Producer of the Year" award at the Caribbean Gospel Music Marlin Awards. She also received Marlin's "New Artist of the Year" and "Contemporary Vocal Performance of the Year (Female)" awards that year. "Crazy", a song from the album, was being played on local Christian radio where she lived in Jamaica. Gotee Records manager TobyMac was visiting the area for an interview, and heard her song on the local station Love 101. After Caribbean Hour host Arnold Kelly played a few of Woods' songs for him, TobyMac obtained her contact info and called her as soon as he returned to the United States. Initially in disbelief upon receiving the call, Ayiesha Woods said, "I wasn’t home when he first called ... I couldn't believe [it]." A few weeks later he invited Woods and her family to a concert he was slated to perform at in Texas, where they met in person. She was soon signed onto his record label, and went in studio to record material for a new album.

== Musical style and influences ==
Ayiesha Woods grew up in a variety of cultures including the Bermuda locale, which has given her music a Caribbean and dancehall sound. Her musical influences include Stevie Wonder, Commissioned, Fred Hammond, Ella Fitzgerald, Lauryn Hill and India.Arie. Her musical genre is generally defined as Christian pop and soul, although it contains much variety on both of her albums, including R&B and urban styles. Woods has said, "I don't want to be placed in one specific category. I think I represent a lot of different styles of music". Her debut album Introducing Ayiesha Woods has been labeled as having "something for everyone", and critics have compared her singing voice to Tracy Chapman and Tasmin Archer. Love Like This is also a multi-genre project, "subtly adding jazz infusions" on the song "Take Me There", although Christian Music Today's review said that it was "not as soulful" as her previous album. Her music includes rock influences ("Big Enough") as well as the contemporary worship style in her songs "Love Like This", "Refine Me", and her originally-independent track "What You Do to Me".
