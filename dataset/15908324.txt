Tragically, the band's singer, Dave Lepard was found dead January 20, 2006, he had committed suicide.  The band decided to go their separate ways after Lepard's death, but later decided to carry on the Crashdïet legacy and keep Dave's spirit alive. During this time period, Martin wrote and recorded many demos (with himself on vocals), but never intended to take Dave's place. The band announced their new singer, H. Olliver Twisted on 21 January 2007 on the first Rest In Sleaze festival that's dedicated to Dave. The band released one album with Twisted as their singer, "The Unattractive Revolution". The album features the singles; "In the Raw" and "Falling Rain". Twisted was let go (or left) Crashdïet on 13 July 2008 and the band started searching for a replacement.
