=== 2010–2012: Beginnings and signing with Cash Money ===
Throughout his childhood, Caskey would write other genres of music, and eventually began writing raps in his sophomore year at Winter Springs High School. Then in his early years, he released two underground mixtapes, Blowin' Out My Mind Vol. 1 and The Intangibles. While recording his third official mixtape Homegrown Vol. 1 he linked up with Orlando area producers The Avengerz. Ever since then, The Avengerz formed a significant part of the production side of his music. A few weeks prior to its release he was in a motorcycle accident, where he suffered pinched nerves in his left arm. On April 20, 2011 Caskey released Homegrown Vol. 1 as a free download.In August 2012, Caskey released his fourth official mixtape titled No Complaints featuring production primarily by The Avengerz. The mixtape would be heard by Cash Money Records producer DJ Nasty, who would pass it on to CEO Birdman. Upon hearing it and meeting with Caskey, Birdman said he immediately knew he was a star. In early August 2012, Cash Money Records released a video of Caskey officially signing to Cash Money. In the video they also revealed his debut studio album would be released in 2013. Not only did he sign a recording contract, but also a publishing, marketing and merchandising deal with Money Mack Music and Cash Money Marketing LLC respectively. Upon signing he said "I’ve wanted to be a performer my whole life, so signing with Cash Money Records and having this platform to release my music has been a dream. I greatly respect Birdman, Slim and the YMCMB family. I look forward to making the city of Orlando, my fans and my label proud." To celebrate he released "Cash Money Records 100 Bars" on September 13.


=== 2012–present: The Transient Classics, Black Sheep, and The Lost Files ===
On December 8, 2012, he released his debut single "Keep It on the Low" featuring Kyle Denmead from the No Complaints mixtape. He had a solo track titled "FBGM" on the YMCMB mixtape Rich Gang: All Stars, which was released on February 18, 2013. Then on February 25, 2013, Cash Money re-released No Complaints with two bonus tracks. He was featured on the Cash Money Records compilation album Rich Gang, on the song "Sunshine" also featuring Birdman, Limp Bizkit and Flo Rida. Artistdirect would call the song one of the album's standout tracks.On June 24, 2013, Caskey announced that his upcoming mixtape would be titled The Transient Classics. On July 16, he revealed the cover art for The Transient Classics and announced it would be released on his 21 birthday, August 28, 2013. On August 20, 2013 he released the music video for the song "Show Me Some", which was shot in Paris, France. The mixtape was produced by The Avengerz, Myles William and The Colleagues and featured guest appearances from Trae tha Truth, Machine Gun Kelly, Riff Raff, JellyRoll, Rittz, and others. Upon its release it was met with positive reviews from music critics. His debut album was recorded at The Hit Factory in Miami, its release was and debuted on 2014. On April 14, 2015 Caskey released a mixtape titled "The Lost Files." It is said, these song were some older songs that possibly did not make the cut for "Black Sheep." Now as whoever edited this, stating "It is said" was merely a rumor going around on the internet. A rumor that started a wave. There is no solid prove or gesture/statement. If you watch the vlog episode's of them making the album of Yelawolf x Blacksheep released in 2021. You will see they wrote all the songs fresh and only included one song, that was recently made from caskey because Yelawolf 'enjoyed the beat' so he wanted to get on it for Blacksheep. "Just the intro" was their first song when they arrived in Nashville and we're amazed how good it turned out so decided to name it "just the intro". To show that their album and collaborative work of art would be good together. McQueen Fiend is the only known track that is a remix and from prior production. His newest project with Yelawolf was supposed to be a fresh start and a debut of his new projects coming. If you did not hear from his recent album or recognize him saying that in 'I Changed' Album from the year 2020. 


== Personal life ==
His father committed suicide when Caskey was sixteen years old. He wrote the songs "Letter to My Father" and "Been Solid" on the No Complaints mixtape, as a tribute to him.
