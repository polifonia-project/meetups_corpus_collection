Kondō appeared on NHK's Kōhaku Uta Gassen annual TV show singing "Midnight Shuffle". From 1998 he went full-time into racing, rarely appearing on TV and not putting out any new songs. His occasional appearances on TV were as a racer or racing commentator. On May 22, 2002, he released a single but it was a cover for his 1985 song "Yoisho".

He appeared in many TV programs, held dinner shows and went on a limited concert tour. He joined many of his successors such as SMAP, KinKi Kids, V6 and Arashi on their TV shows.
On January 25, 2006, Sony released Kondō's tribute album Matchy Tribute, in which Hitomi Takahashi covered the song "Midnight Shuffle".

The lyrics of both songs were written by Kōhan Kawauchi. Kawauchi sent the lyrics of the song to Johnny & Associates in 1989 but it had never been released until Kawauchi's death in 2008.
