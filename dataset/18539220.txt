== Personal life ==


=== Background and early life ===
Trevor Hall grew up in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.  He grew up surrounded by music due in part to his father who was a drummer and musician. After dabbling with multiple instruments including trombone and bass, he decided to learn guitar in hopes of becoming a singer-songwriter one day. At age 16 he recorded his first album. Shortly after, Hall left South Carolina for Los Angeles where he enrolled and studied classical guitar at Idyllwild Arts Academy. During his time, he was introduced to yoga and meditation practices and spirituality, which made a major impact on him and has since influenced his life and music. He stated that one of the most important weekends of his life was when he went to a Hindu temple for a weekend while at Idyllwild. At the temple, he learned about the Hindu goddess Kali and was happily surprised to find out people worship God as a woman. After he graduated, he attended a Kali Mandir (Hindu temple) and eventually accepted Hindu Swami Bhajanananda Saraswati as his guru. He has stated that he tries to treat his music as karma yoga, where he wants to create music that will help other people.  During his senior year at Idyllwild Arts Academy, Hall was signed to Geffen Records, which signaled the formal start of his career.


=== Current ===
