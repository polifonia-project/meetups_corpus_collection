== Stage name ==
Bias B described to the Cairns Post the origin of his stage name: "The name 'Bias' didn't come from prejudicial attitudes, it came from the frequency on a cassette tape. Bias is the inaudible, high-frequency tone mixed with the input signal that passes through the recording head to excite tape particles, preparing it to record effectively."
