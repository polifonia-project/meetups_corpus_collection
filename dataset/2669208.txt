In 2020, Rich made headlines when he accused the Lipscomb Academy Dean of Intercultural Development Brittany Paschall  of racist "indoctrination". Students at the school were assigned to read the essay "Whose Story Is It?" which mentions white privilege. This essay was written by Laurie Halse Anderson, a white woman. Rich, a white man, claimed the essay could harm white children and claimed "racism does not exist at this school based on my experience there." Lipscomb Academy's adjacent university had previously faced allegations of racist events happening on campus. Although she did not distribute the essay to the children, Brittany Paschall, a black woman, was dismissed from her position in 2020 following this incident.
