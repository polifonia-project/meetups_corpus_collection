== Early life ==
Chrispa was born Chrisanthi-Pagona Pitiropoulou (Chris-pa) in Athens, Greece on 7 December 1982. At the age of five, she moved to Pireus, Greece where she began to experiment with music and dance. Originally, she had no dream to become a singer, and loved ballet. After thirteen years of ballet, she left it behind partly because of her short height, and pursued musical instruments, taking courses at her school for phonetics, piano and guitar.Chrispa's singing career began at age 18 when she sang a song with Sofia Vossou at her summer concert in Aegina. Vossou described Chrispa's voice as "very good" and her connections eventually helped Chrispa get a record contract with Alpha Records. Her talent was quickly realized and she sang in more concerts with other popular singers such as Stamatis Gonidis, Labis Livieratos, and Themis Adamantidis.
