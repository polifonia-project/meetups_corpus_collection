== Career ==


=== Pascal Pinon ===
In 2009, when they were 14 years old, Jófríður, her twin sister Ásthildur, Halla Kristjánsdóttir, and Kristín Ylfa Hólmgrímsdóttir formed the group.  They released their self-produced first album, Pascal Pinon in 2009 which was then re-released by the Morr Music label in 2010. It was described by Allmusic as “a truly lovely record.” In 2013 the group, now a duo, released their second album Twosomeness. A third album, Sundur, was released in 2016.


=== Samaris ===
Jófríður, Áslaug Rún Magnúsdóttir and Þórður Kári Steinþórsson formed Samaris in 2011. The group won the 2011 Icelandic Músíktilraunir competition and followed this success by self-releasing the EP Hljóma Þú EP, which then won a 2011 Icelandic Kraumur award. A further self-released EP, Stofnar falla, followed in 2012. The group signed with One Little Independent Records and their self-titled debut album was released in July 2013 to generally favourable reviews. The album combined their compositions with lyrics taken from 19th-century Icelandic poems. Samaris released Silkidrangar in 2014, Silkidrangar Sessions in 2015, and Black Lights in 2016.


=== Gangly ===
In 2014, Jófríður was involved with the conceptual project Gangly with Sindri Már Sigfússon (Sin Fang) and Úlfur Alexander Einarsson (of the Icelandic band Oyama) initially releasing the track Fuck With Someone Else. Gangly went on to sign to UK label AMF Records and made a series of video singles.


=== JFDR ===
In 2017 her solo album Brazil (produced in collaboration with Shahzad Ismaily) was released. In 2018 she was named "Artist of the Year" by The Reykjavík Grapevine tabloid magazine. JFDR - White Sun Live. Part I : Strings, an EP of her songs reworked with a string section, was released in 2018. Gravity, a special EP, was released during the 2018 Iceland Airwaves in the form of a bar of chocolate with a download code. In 2020, Jófríður, along with her four sisters, gave a video concert in Reykjavík to an empty hall (due to the Covid-19 pandemic) for the album release of New Dreams.  The pandemic also caused the cancellation of her spring and fall 2020 tours. New Dreams won the (Reykjavík) Grapevine Music Awards 2021 album of the year.

Jófríður has collaborated with Low Roar, Lapalux, Daníel Bjarnason, Damien Rice, Aaron Roche, Nini Julia Bang, Sin Fang, Birnir, Max Sokolinski, Kreld, Aves, Örvar Smárason, Strange Boy, and Penelope Trappes. In December of 2020 she performed with Ólafur Arnalds in A Sunrise Session video.
