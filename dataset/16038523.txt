Soon after making this decision, Granfelt was asked to join Finnish Rock'n'roll sensation Los Bastardos Finlandeses by the band's lead singer Bryn Jones. It did not take too long for Granfelt to join Los Bastardos Finlandeses full-time and contribute to songwriting for their next album.Granfelt has achieved nidan (二段:にだん) second degree black belt in karate and black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
