Leo Williams, also known as E-zee-kill, is an English-Jamaican bass guitarist residing in the United Kingdom.
After a stint with the band Basement 5, Williams co-founded Big Audio Dynamite in 1984, a band led by Mick Jones, best known from The Clash. Other BAD members included Don Letts, Greg Roberts and Dan Donovan.
After four albums together, the original BAD lineup dissolved in 1989. Williams, together with Don Letts and drummer Greg Roberts, formed the band Screaming Target after Big Audio Dynamite's demise. Later, Williams joined Dreadzone, a group with his former bandmate Dan Donovan, and, again, Greg Roberts.
In March 2007, it was announced that—in addition to his work with Dreadzone—Leo Williams would be a touring bassist for Carbon/Silicon, Mick Jones' latest musical endeavor. Williams appeared in the band's video for "The News," and is featured as a band member on the official Carbon/Silicon website.Williams is again playing with Big Audio Dynamite, which re-formed in 2011.
Williams also featured in the 1997 film The Fifth Element as the fuel loader of the Fhloston Paradise shuttle.
