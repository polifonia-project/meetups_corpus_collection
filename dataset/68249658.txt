== Early life ==
Nathan Bird is a Butchulla man who grew up in Katherine, Northern Territory and describes himself as "a proud Murri man with Badtjala, Juru, Scottish and Melanesian heritage."In 2019, Bird said "I remember staying up late on the weekends just so that I could catch Rage play the standard half an hour of rap videos, before their programming would return to whatever was popular on the Australian charts at the time. Seeing artists like Ice Cube speak out against police brutality and racism on "Fuck tha Police" is still one of the coolest things I've ever witnessed. It reminded me of my father and how his confidence would never break stride, no matter where he was or who he was with. Since that day, my passion for hip-hop has never wavered."


== Career ==
Birdz released "Red Black and Yellow" in June 2013 which is inspired by experiences as a young Aboriginal man residing in Brisbane, Queensland. The song paints a vivid picture of the everyday challenges black Australia continues to endure. Birdz released his debut EP Birdz Eye View in September 2013.In February 2015, Birdz told The Guardian "I'm a full-time rapper and part-time support worker for Link-Up Victoria, currently residing in Melbourne."Birdz released his debut studio album Train of Thought in August 2017. At the Music Victoria Awards of 2017, the album was nominated for Best Hip Hop Album, while it won Best Independent Hip Hop Album at the AIR Awards of 2018.
