Verkaik was born in Son en Breugel, Netherlands, on 16 June 1975, and grew up in Nuenen near Eindhoven. She graduated from the Rotterdam Conservatory.


== Career ==
Before her acting career began, Verkaik sang in various pop bands for over ten years. Her first professional theatre role was that of an ensemble member in the Dutch production of Elisabeth.In 2004, Verkaik recorded the singing voice of Erica in the Dutch version of the animated movie Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper. In 2008, she was the Dutch voice of Lydia in Barbie & the Diamond Castle.
Since then, her musical theatre credits have included Elisabeth (in Holland and Thun, Switzerland), The Three Musketeers, We Will Rock You, and most notably, Wicked, in which she was chosen as the "Wicked Personality of the Year" in 2010, out of all the actresses who had played the role, in an online poll with over 16,000 voters. Verkaik is the only actress in the world to play Elphaba in three languages: she has performed in the German, Dutch, Broadway, and West End productions.
Verkaik originated the role of Elphaba in the original German-language production of Wicked, which was entitled "Wicked: Die Hexen Von Oz", and began performances in Stuttgart on 1 November 2007, prior to an official opening night on November 15. Sabrina Weckerlin was her original alternate, appearing in the two shows a week in which Verkaik was not contracted to perform.

Verkaik soon repeated her performance in the Dutch-language production, which premiered in Scheveningen on 6 November 2011, after previews from 26 October. This required her to learn the role in her native language. The run ended on 11 January 2013 and Verkaik then transferred to North America, making her Broadway debut in the English-speaking New York company of Wicked and marking her third language production. Verkaik played a limited 15-week engagement at the Gershwin Theatre from 12 February 2013 to 26 May 2013.Verkaik subsequently played the role of Donna in the Stuttgart production of Mamma Mia! for a limited run starting 26 July 2013, before playing the role of Elphaba again. Beginning on 18 November 2013, she made her West End debut in Wicked at the Apollo Victoria Theatre, London. Due to health reasons, Verkaik had to depart early from the West End production of Wicked on 19 July 2014, and was replaced by original cast member Kerry Ellis.She can be heard on Wicked's German-language cast recording, as well as Scott Alan's album What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up and on the Scott Alan album LIVE, which was recorded at the Birdland jazz club in New York City on 30 April 2012. The CD was released on 26 June 2012.
Verkaik also provided the Dutch speaking and singing voice and the German singing voice of Elsa, the Snow Queen in Disney's 2013 animated movie Frozen (the German speaking voice was provided by Dina Kürten). She also performed the song "Let It Go" in English at the UK premiere of the movie.
It was announced on 24 October 2014 that Verkaik would be joining the cast of the musical, Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, alongside Tasmin Greig, Ricardo Afonso, Hadyn Gwynne, Jérôme Pradon and Anna Skellern, in the role of Paulina. The show's previews started on 16 December 2014 at the West End's Playhouse Theatre with an opening night on 12 January 2015. The show ran until 23 May 2015. This was Verkaik's first role after her surgery in 2014.
It was announced on 14 July 2015 that Verkaik would be returning to Stuttgart as Kala in Tarzan in August 2015, at the Stage Apollo Theater.On 14 September 2016, it was revealed that Verkaik would return to her starring role of Elphaba in the West End production of Wicked beginning 30 January 2017 as part of the production's 10th anniversary celebrations. She played her final performance on 22 July 2017 and was succeeded by Alice Fearn. Verkaik confirmed in her speech at the end of her final performance that, after 10 years, it was her last ever performance as Elphaba.
