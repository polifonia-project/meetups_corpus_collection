In January 2009, members Choi Jong-hoon, Choi Min-hwan, and Lee Jae-jin were put into the sub group "A3". This group debuted at the 2009 New Year concert My First Dream held at the JCB Hall in Tokyo, Japan on 2 January 2009. Minhwan performed as the drummer and a sub-vocalist. The group's name was "A3" due to each of the three members having type A blood. This group was formed to help take up some singing time during their concerts, so that lead singer, Lee Hong-gi, would not over-strain his voice.
In late 2009, the triple-member group was renamed F.T. Triple, with Choi Min-hwan as drummer and sub vocalist. They released the single Love Letter and began performing on music shows.
