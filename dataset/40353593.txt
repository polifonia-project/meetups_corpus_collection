He began serving as an accordionist and harpist with a variety of local Zydeco bands.Delafose began his career playing in the fais do-do of his area, a Cajun dance party. Later, he gained public recognition with albums like Joe Pete Got Two Women (Arhoolie) and Blues Stay Away from Me (Rounder). In the mid-1970s, he formed the band The Eunice Playboys, with which he played until his death. The band continues under the direction of his son Geno Delafose.
John Delafose died in 1994.
