== Early life ==
Growing up in a musical family influenced Bennett's interest in music. Her mother once aspired to be a DJ and her uncle is Mikey Bennett, an internationally popular reggae producer and studio owner from Jamaica. As she explained, "I began wishing I could take credit for some of my favorite songs. That was when I started to make my own – I only began singing on my own songs when I really started writing." When Bennett was 14, she built a small music studio in her home and worked on sound engineering before getting into production.For the first half of her high school years, Syd attended Palisades Charter High School. She felt left out and had few friends at Palisades and moved to the Hamilton Music Academy, which she considered a more open-minded school.
