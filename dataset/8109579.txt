== Notes ==
Sachi admitted that Aitai yo is actually a song that she wrote to express her feelings when she had to leave the person she loved during the summer of 2006. She also admits that her lyrics was soaked with tears by the time she was finished writing them, and that the greatest thing about singers is that they can express their true feelings honestly through melody and voice.
