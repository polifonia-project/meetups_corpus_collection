== Biography ==


=== Childhood and early life ===
Growing up in Sydney, Mozgawa was raised by her Polish parents, who had moved from Poland to Australia to perform music together as a musical duo.At age 13, Mozgawa began playing the drums, and was initially influenced by the drummer Zac Hanson from the pop band Hanson. She explained: "For a lot of people who are a half-generation older than me it was Tommy Lee, but for me it was Zac Hanson from Hanson. I'm probably in a smaller group of people who were really turned on to the profession by that particular man". At age 14, Mozgawa pretended to be a "20-year-old Polish immigrant with no ID" to perform at Sydney music venues.


=== Early career ===
From 2000 Mozgawa's early Sydney bands included Nick Maybury on lead guitar. Early in 2006 Mozgawa and Maybury formed Mink in New York City alongside Neal Carlson on lead vocals, Grant Fitzpatrick on bass guitar and David Lowy on rhythm guitar. The pop rock group issued a self-titled debut album in August 2007 but had disbanded  by 2009.Mozgawa befriended Red Hot Chili Peppers bass guitarist Flea, who suggested she move to Los Angeles, eventually meeting the members of Warpaint. During this time she lived at Flea's house: "He was so instrumental in me meeting the Warpaint girls. He was the first person to even say their name to me and the first time I hung out with them was around him and around his friends, so he had a huge part to do with that. There’s a lot of people from that era that were raised on certain music that have so much integrity. Whether you’re a Red Hot Chilli Peppers fan or not, he really means what he does and he’s a punk at heart. He doesn’t give a shit about metrics or who’s popular, he’s just about the soul of music."


=== With Warpaint ===

In Los Angeles, Mozgawa befriended Warpaint vocalist and guitarist Theresa Wayman in late 2009. She was subsequently invited to join the band and replaced Shannyn Sossamon. Mozgawa featured in the recording of the band's first album, The Fool (2010). In 2014, the band released its second studio album, Warpaint, with Mozgawa contributing fully to the songwriting process, followed by Heads Up in 2016.
