== Early life ==
Shay was born Dorothy Sims in Jacksonville, Florida.  When she began her career as a 'straight' singer, she took vocal lessons to lose her Southern accent. She sang for the USO during World War II. Dorothy changed her name to "Shay" in order to not be confused with Ginny Simms, another performer of the day, choosing "Shay" to honor her mentor Betty Shay (later Betty Corday). While performing with Morton Gould and his orchestra, she performed an encore, "Uncle Fud", a hayseed novelty number that became popular and launched her solo singing career.

In 1970 she appeared as Widow Krebs in the TV Western The Virginian in the episode titled "You Can Lead a Horse to Water."
