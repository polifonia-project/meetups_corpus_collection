=== Early life and discovery (1988–2003) ===
Irvin Salinas, known as Pee Wee, was born on December 8, 1988, in Othello, Washington to a Mexican-American family. He is the youngest of three siblings (his older sister named Elizabeth Salinas and his older brother Simon Salinas). His mother, María Martínez, changed residence to La Joya, Texas, located 18 miles west of McAllen, Texas. Irvin began to wash cars, wash dishes  and perform other small jobs in order to provide his family with extra income. At thirteen, he met A.B. Quintanilla, brother of Selena, in a casting at Pee Wee's middle school. It was then that A.B. Quintanilla expressed interest in Pee Wee, and informed him about a casting for a music video with his band and offered him an audition. Irvin accepted, presenting to him a few days later in the casting. He also went to Memorial Middle School and La Joya High School.


=== Kumbia Kings (2003–06) ===
His artistic career began in 2003 when he joined A.B. Quintanilla's band Kumbia Kings after several members like Frankie J and DJ Kane left Kumbia Kings. In 2004, he recorded his first song and video with Kumbia Kings, "Sabes a Chocolate" on the album Los Remixes 2.0, released on April 6, 2004, being a round success and showing a very good response of the public. Due to the success, Quintanilla decided the absolute stay of Irvin, and nicknamed him "Pee Wee" for being the minor of all the band members. It was on the album Fuego, released on October 5, 2004, that included his second success "Na Na Na (Dulce Niña)", being much accepted also by the public, and his success led to it reaching a big popularity with the public, and especially with the fans, who increased notably thanks to him.
On April 7, 2005, Pee Wee along with A.B. Quintanilla and the rest of the Kumbia Kings participated in Selena ¡VIVE!, the tribute concert for Selena, A.B. Quintanilla's sister, performing "Baila Esta Kumbia". Kumbia Kings later released the album Duetos on March 29, 2005, which included "Baila Esta Kumbia".
Kumbia Kings released their live album Kumbia Kings Live on April 4, 2006, which included the single "Pachuco". They won a Latin Grammy for the album Kumbia Kings Live.
Later, on August 2006, a legal disagreement between A.B. Quintanilla and Cruz Martínez, the co-producer of the band, resulted in A.B. Quintanilla leaving Kumbia Kings. Other members started to leave including Pee Wee who left Kumbia Kings after Cruz Martínez replaced him with Jo-Joe because he didn't show up for a concert. Pee Wee continued with A.B. Quintanilla and Chris Pérez (brother-in-law of Quintanilla), joining him in his following project that would be the band Kumbia All Starz.


=== Kumbia All Starz (2006–08) ===
On August 2006, Pee Wee became the lead singer for A.B. Quintanilla's new band Kumbia All Starz. Kumbia All Starz launched their single "Chiquilla" on September 19, 2006 which turned out to be a success.

They also launched other singles in 2007, "Parece Que Va a Llover", "Speedy Gonzales", and "Mami/Anoche No Dormí". Nevertheless, on February 1, 2008, it was announced that Pee Wee had left the band Kumbia All Starz to begin a career as solo singer a month before the band's second album Planeta Kumbia was released. A.B. Quintanilla declared that he had already signed a contract with a record company of which the name he did not mention.
On March 12, 2008, Pee Wee presented himself in the program Don Francisco Presenta, transmitted by Univision, in which he declared that it was false: "Everything he said is false, I never signed with any record company but, yes I have received many offers lately and have not accepted any yet" he declared. Also it gave an exclusive interview the raw declarations about his abandonment of the band and of the ill-treatment that he and his partners of band were receiving on the part of A.B. Quintanilla.
When one questioned him if he had decided to leave the band, he declared: "A.B. gave us a date that he would pay us the money from the recordings that we had done, nevertheless the date had happened and he had not given us any of the money. We had a meeting in which we spoke about several topics, but apparently he said to us that we were replaceable and that we could leave if we wanted, that the door was opened. Me and my partners Memo and Roque could leave that the door was opened and that we were going away".
He gave the declarations given by Pee Wee individually without the company of the band or of anybody. He also declared the maltreatment that his mother, Maria Martínez had got from Quintanilla, on having sent his representative Luigi Giraldo to call her to say that they had 24 hours to leave the house that Quintanilla had offered to Pee Wee and his mother. Pee Wee said that he is going to keep on singing and not leave his fans.
