=== 2013: The X Factor ===

In July 2013, Friend won TeenStar 2013. That same year, Friend auditioned for the tenth series of The X Factor in front of judges Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow, Nicole Scherzinger and Sharon Osbourne. Friend's room audition, in which he sang "Stand by Me", was the first audition of the series to be broadcast. Walsh commented "You have your own style, your own finish, love your voice. You're different." and Friend received four yeses from the judges, sending him through to the arena auditions. Friend's arena audition saw him sing "Too Much Love Will Kill You", after which he was sent through to bootcamp in the Boys category, mentored by Walsh. He performed "Alone" at bootcamp, and then "Cannonball" and "Somewhere Only We Know" at judges' houses, after which he was put through to the live shows by Walsh. In week 6, Friend was in the bottom two with Sam Callahan, but was saved after Walsh refused to vote and then Scherzinger and Barlow voted to send Callahan home leaving Osbourne's vote unnecessary but stated that she would have saved Friend. In the quarter-final, he was in the bottom two with Tamera Foster. Walsh and Osbourne voted to send Friend through to the semi-final, and Scherzinger and Barlow voted to send Foster through to the semi-final and the result went to deadlock. Friend was saved by the public vote and advanced to the semi-final. In the semi-final he was in the bottom two again, this time with Rough Copy. Walsh and Osbourne voted to send Friend through to the final, while Barlow and Scherzinger voted to send Rough Copy through to the final. The result went to deadlock and Friend advanced to the final.
