Ataraxia is an Italian neoclassical dark wave band founded in 1985. Frontlined by singer Francesca Nicoli, it combines modern technology with archaic instrumentation. The lyrical themes are frequently drawn from nature and ancient cultures.


== History ==
The band was founded by Francesca Nicoli and Michele Urbano in November 1985. In the first five years there were many musicians in the band, until finally Francesca Nicoli, Vittorio Vandelli, and Giovanni Pagliari became the basic line-up until today.


== Style and lyrical themes ==
The band combine modern technology with archaic instrumentation over various media. The members have said they have dedicated their lives to art, to explore the nobleness of centuries in many possible ways (music, poetry, theatre, and photography). They define themselves as "craftsmen of the sound" because they create an unusual mix of sacred and profane, atmospheric and experimental, contemporary and early music, using acoustic and electric instruments as well, always with such language which fits best to the actual work.
The word ataraxia is taken from Epicurean philosophy and means "equanimity", "calmness" and "unflappability". Ataraxia place themselves in a spiritual tradition from Greco-Roman and Celtic cultures. Nicoli has described the production process as "medianic" and associated it with the cult of Dionysus, where "the musician was possessed by the God of Nature who spoke through him/her". Regarding the band's pagan themes, Nicoli associates the word paganism with the countryside, and maintains that life in the countryside creates a connection to the rhythm of nature. In that sense, she considers Atarax a pagan band: "I feel that I'm in a communion with that which surrounds me".
