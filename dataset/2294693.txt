== History ==
Talley filled in on drums with The Black Dahlia Murder after their touring drummer, Pierre Langlois, was denied entry into the States by his home country of Canada. He was a session drummer on Soils of Fate's 2003 release Crime Syndicate. He filled in with The Red Chord for their 2006 tour, and was also filling in with Hate Eternal for their 2006 North American tour, after Derek Roddy left the band due to personal reasons. In May and June 1998, Kevin filled in the drum throne for Suffocation on their U.S. tour.  Kevin also auditioned to be the drummer for Slayer after Paul Bostaph's departure in late 2001, but the job ultimately went to their original drummer, Dave Lombardo. Talley played on Chimaira's self-titled album and toured with them until early 2006.  He now plays with Dååth and Nothnegal; in addition to this, he played drums in 2012 on the tracks titled "Cradle to Grave" and "Novus Ordo Seclorum" by Creative Waste.  In 2019 he played drums on Nonvector's debut EP "A Short Trip Home".
