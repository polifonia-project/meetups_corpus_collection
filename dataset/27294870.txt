== American Memory ==
Bennett worked on a video project called American Memory with guitarist William Morrison. According to Morrison, the idea of the project is that far in the future, after America no longer exists, an archive of American audio and visual material is discovered by a group of artists, who reinterpret their findings and broadcast them back in time.

American Memory toured with ohGr in the United States and Canada in 2008, adding visuals to the shows. Bennett toured with Skinny Puppy on their last three tours, "Greater Wrong of the Right", "Mythrus", and "In Solvent See". In spring 2010 he toured with My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult and Bahntier.
