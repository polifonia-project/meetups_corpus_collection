Signing with Sony, he released his first single in 1995, but to no great success. Hirai used the next four years to consolidate his style and take time out – he only released one single each in 1997 and 1998 and did not produce any new music during 1999. Fans waited until 2000 for a third album from Hirai, The Changing Same. It was the first single, "Lakuen" (楽園, Paradise), that established him as a major player in the Japanese sales charts and overseas. Hirai was voted "Best New Japanese Act" in a pop poll organized by the RTHK radio station in Hong Kong.

A popular nursery rhyme, it was expected to be a minor success, but went on to become one of the biggest hits of the year.
