== Artistic career ==


=== New Kids on the Block ===
In 1985, just before his 13th birthday, he joined New Kids on the Block, replacing [Jamie Kelly]. Since the other four members of the band were already long-time school friends, he initially found it difficult to mesh with them. They eventually became one of the most successful boy bands of the late 20th century, producing two number one albums on the US Billboard charts. In 1991, Forbes listed the band as the highest-earning entertainers, beating Madonna and Michael Jackson. They split in 1994, but they reunited in 2008 and have remained active since.


=== Solo career ===
Following their split, McIntyre busied himself with songwriting and sought a solo recording contract. He made his acting debut in the film The Fantasticks, which was based on the long-running off-Broadway musical. This 1995 film, starring Joel Grey and Jean Louisa Kelly, was released in theatres five years later.
Disenchanted by his inability to find a recording contract, McIntyre used his own money to record his first solo album Stay the Same and sold it on his website. He then chose the album's title track as a single and took it to local Boston DJs, which eventually garnered the song national airplay. The combination of airplay and website sales for the single led to him signing a recording contract in 1999 with Sony Music USA, under the C2 label, a subsidiary of Columbia Records, which had previously been home to New Kids on the Block. The album was re-released on Sony's Work Records and sold more than a million copies around the world and the single "Stay The Same" peaked at No. 10 in the Billboard Hot 100.  The second single from the album was "I Love You Came Too Late".
Also in 1999, McIntyre recorded the song "Remember Me" for the film Southie, which starred former bandmate Donnie Wahlberg. In 2001, McIntyre released his second solo album, Meet Joe Mac, but it did not chart. "Rain" was the only single released from this album.
In 2004, McIntyre released his fourth solo album, 8:09, followed by Talk To Me, an album of cover versions, in December 2006.
In April 2008, the New Kids on the Block reunited. The single "Summertime" was released in May 2008. Their first full-length album in fourteen years was released on September 2, 2008, titled The Block. On September 18, 2008, they kicked off their reunion tour. In 2009, they began a 'Full Service' summer tour. They toured with Backstreet Boys in 2011.
On November 17, 2009, McIntyre released the single and video "Here We Go Again" from his upcoming EP of the same name. It was produced by Brent Paschke, Gabe Lopez, and Drew Ryan Scott. Paschke, Lopez and Scott also share cowriting with McIntyre on the project. The EP was released on iTunes in December 2009.
In November 2011, McIntyre released a Christmas album titled Come Home for Christmas. The album features a collaboration with fellow New Kid Jordan Knight on "Peace on Earth" and includes holiday classics such as "Winter Wonderland", "Do You Hear What I Hear?" and "The Christmas Song".On October 23, 2020, McIntyre returned with the song "Own This Town", his first solo release since 2011's Come Home for Christmas. He said of the song, "I wrote this song years ago, with a totally different intention. To me it’s about taking your shot, swinging for the fences, going for it. And I think it really takes on a new meaning now".
