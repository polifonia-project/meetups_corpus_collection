He made his professional opera debut in 1827 at the Paris Opera as Rodrigo in Gioachino Rossini's La donna del lago; a performance which was not well received. However, on 27 December 1827 he had a major success at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna as Peter I of Russia in Giovanni Pacini's Il falegname di Livronia. This performance launched a major career for Poggi in Italy's most important opera houses.In 1828 Poggi returned to Bologna where he appeared successfully as Emerico in Carlo Coccia's Clotilde and as Lindoro in Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri.

He was then committed to the Teatro Apollo in Venice in 1836-1837, singing such roles as Don Pedro in Giuseppe Persiani's Ines de Castro, Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor, and Bellini's Elvino. At that theatre he also performed the role of Ghino Degli Armieri in the first performance of Donizetti's Pia de' Tolomei on 18 February 1837.From 1835-1840 Poggi appeared periodically at the Theater am Kärntnertor where he was much admired in the operas of Donizetti.

He also appeared at La Scala as Don Ottavio in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Don Giovanni and Orombello in Bellini's Beatrice di Tenda among other roles. His last year of activity in Italy was in Bologna in 1848.
