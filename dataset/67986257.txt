Quasar's design career has since included animations and graphics for RuPaul's Drag Race world tours, as well work with Drag Race winner Jinkx Monsoon.In 2018, Quasar re-designed the existing rainbow flag to incorporate the transgender flag, as well as black and brown stripes to represent LGBTQ+ communities of color "as well as those living with AIDS, those no longer living, and the stigma surrounding them". The additional colors were added in a chevron shape along the hoist to represent forward movement. They began a crowdfunding campaign to fund the first production of the flags. In 2020, the British Medical Association began to adopt the flag. In 2021, Deliveroo adopted the progress pride flag for Pride Month.
