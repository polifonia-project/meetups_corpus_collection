== Biography ==
Rose Falcon is the daughter of singer-songwriter Billy Falcon and hairdresser Myla Falcon. Her early years were spent in a studio apartment in New York City, New York, although the family moved to New Jersey when she was old enough to attend school. In 1987, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and died two years later (inspiring the song "Best Friend"), forcing her father to raise her himself as he traveled around the country for his music career. Falcon was ten years old when they moved to Nashville. Inspired by the loss of her mother and feeling out of place throughout her school years, she began writing poetry which eventually led to songwriting.
Falcon signed to Columbia Records at the age of fourteen and released her debut album, Rose Falcon, in 2003. In August 2011, she signed with Show Dog-Universal Music and began working on her first country pop album, which was later released in the form of two EP's entitled, "19th Avenue Volume 1" and "19th Avenue Volume 2  and received an endorsement from Jon Bon Jovi."Give Into Me", a song co-written by Falcon, Billy Falcon, and Elisha Hoffman, was recorded by Country singer Faith Hill for the soundtrack of the motion picture Country Strong.

"Friday Night", was later recorded by Eric Paslay and released as a single on April 22, 2013 and reached number one on the Mediabase country chart.In June 2013, Falcon became engaged to country artist Rodney Atkins.
