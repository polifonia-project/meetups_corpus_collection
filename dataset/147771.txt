== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Born in New Haven, Connecticut, she lived there until age eight when her family moved to the Caribbean until she was eleven and thereafter in California, mostly in Los Angeles. Her brother is Paul Roessler, a keyboardist known for involvement in several Los Angeles area bands including The Screamers.


=== Musician ===
Roessler began studying piano when she was six but quit at age eleven. At fourteen she picked up the bass guitar and committed to learning the instrument. Her first band was called Waxx and she played her first gig at age sixteen at Whiskey A Go-Go. Other early bands were Sexsick, The Visitors, and The Monsters. She then joined with a post-Germs Pat Smear to form Twisted Roots.Members of Black Flag heard her playing while she was sitting in with L.A. punk group DC3.  This led to her being asked to join Black Flag in 1983 to replace founding member Chuck Dukowski. Vocalist Henry Rollins later reported that Greg Ginn, Black Flag's leader, guitarist and primary songwriter, had grown frustrated with Dukowski's failure to progress as a musician beyond the band's hardcore punk roots and was drawn to Roessler's more nimble and sophisticated playing. Roessler was majoring in applied engineering at UCLA, and Black Flag's subsequent tours were worked around her school schedule, which was a condition for her to join the band. Her bass playing was featured on five of Black Flag's studio albums and two officially released live albums. During her early live performances with the band she was sometimes mistaken as male due to her androgynous appearance, and she subsequently dressed in more glamorously traditional female garb for the band's tours. She remained in the band until completing touring behind their album In My Head in the autumn of 1985, then graduated from UCLA in 1986.
After Black Flag, she formed the two-bass duo Dos with Mike Watt (to whom she was married between 1987 and 1994). Dos' most recent album was released in 2011. She wrote or co-wrote songs for what would be the Minutemen's final album, 3-Way Tie, and contributed lyrics to Watt's post-Minutemen band Firehose. She later contributed artwork to Watt's first solo album, Ball-Hog or Tugboat?.
She appeared as a backing vocalist on the Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three tribute album in 2003 along with other musical artists, including other Black Flag veterans.In December 2018, Roessler joined with Devin Hoff to form the two-bass band AwkWard and released their first album In Progress.On August 13th of 2021 on the Protonic Reversal podcast, Kira revealed that an album of solo material would be released in on October 19, 2021 on Kitten Robot records.
