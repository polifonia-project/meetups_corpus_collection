=== Loudermilk & Gosling (1995–2006) ===

In 1995, friends Davey Ingersoll (vocals, guitar), Mark Watrous (guitar), Shane Middleton (bass) and Carpenter formed the hard rock quartet Loudermilk in the Tri-Cities of Washington. Initially formed as a Guns N' Roses cover band, with the name .22s and Tulips, in high school, they released their own independent album, Man with Gun Kills Three! in 1998. American Recordings heard a demo of theirs and subsequently signed them.  However, despite touring with famous bands such as Mötley Crüe and Megadeth, they were dropped from the label. DreamWorks Records signed them in early 2002. Several months later, they recorded and released their first official major label album, The Red Record.

The group later changed their name to Gosling, after changing their musical style, retaining all members with Watrous switching from guitar to keyboards. Influenced by the likes of Sunny Day Real Estate, The Smashing Pumpkins, Pink Floyd and Queen, they released the Gosling EP through The Control Group in August 2004. Earlier in the year, they supported Velvet Revolver at The Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood, California. They released their debut full-length Here Is... in 2006 through V2 and went on to tour with Rose Hill Drive.A cover of David Bowie's "Cat People (Putting Out Fire)" was included on the soundtrack to the film Underworld: Evolution in 2006.

In 2006, The Exies announced that they were to return to the studio to record a new album with Carpenter joining the group to perform drums on the album. The result was A Modern Way of Living with the Truth, produced by James Michael, released by the band's new label Eleven Seven. Carpenter toured with the group for a month before departing.


=== Loaded (2009–present) ===

In September 2009, drummer Geoff Reading announced his departure from Loaded and at the same time he informed everyone that his replacement was Carpenter:

'I am sad to report that, for now, I have to step down as drummer for Duff McKagan's Loaded.
The pressures of being in the "Duff from Guns N' Roses" spotlight, while thrilling, have left me unable to get back to the performer I was pre-cancer, and unable to properly provide for my family. This combination has plagued my mental recovery, and I need to take time-now-to focus on these things.

The fellas have hired the great Isaac Carpenter to fill in for the UK tour, with a warm-up show at the Chop-Suey in Seattle on Oct 3. I wouldn't miss this show for anything. Issac(sic) is an AMAZING drummer and I, for one, will be right there in front of the stage, with all you Capitol Hill hipsters, arms folded, judging them.

Carpenter performed with the group on their tour supporting Black Stone Cherry, during their tour of Europe, UK and Ireland that had been announced in June.
On December 2, McKagan announced via his Twitter that he and the band were jamming on some new material. while guitarist Mike Squires stated in an online interview, on December 6, that the band were hoping to record a new album and to be touring and supporting it in 2010.On February 1, 2010, it was announced, via Blabbermouth.net, that the group had parted ways with label Century Media and were now looking for a new label having already written and demoed new material.On July 4, 2010, the band announced they were to begin pre-production and enter the studio in August to record the follow-up to Sick stating:

'We have been writing for the last few months and next week we start pre-production on the new Loaded record! We couldn't be happier and we think you fuckers will be, too!
As it is looking, we will be recording it in August and thus begins Loaded Mach III!'
