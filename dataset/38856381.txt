Anthony Ausgang (born Anthony Charles Grant Thompson, May 22, 1959) is an artist and writer born in Pointe-Ã -Pierre, Trinidad and Tobago in 1959 who lives and works in Los Angeles.  Ausgang is a principal painter associated with the Lowbrow art movement, one of "the first major wave of lowbrow artists" to show in Los Angeles in the early 1980s.  The protagonists of his paintings are cats -- "psychedelic, wide eyed, with a kind of evil look in their eyes".
