Atsushi Kamijo (上條淳士, Kamijō Atsushi, born March 12, 1963 in Tokyo, Japan) is a Japanese manga artist. At times he is billed as "Atsushi Kamijo and Yoko", which refers to Yoko Murase, his assistant. Kamijo is known for his stylish designs, which often use pure white backgrounds with very little middle ground between black and white. Atsushi made his debut in a special issue of Shonen Sunday in 1983 with the story "Mob Hunter".
