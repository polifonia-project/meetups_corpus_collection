Ritu Haruma Timi
Sajhko Jun Sangai
Chot Ke Ho Byatha Ke Ho
Jati Maya Laae Pani
Bhulu Bhulu Lagyo Malai
Aankhako Need Khosi Lane
Jindagi Ke Chaa Ra Aakhir
Aru Sanga Najokha Malai
Dosh Kasailaai Dina Chahhanna
Timi Herchhau Bhane
Yo Manko Ke Bhar Hunchha
Na Pohkine Na Jokhine
Mero Haath Na Badha (Last Recorded song)
