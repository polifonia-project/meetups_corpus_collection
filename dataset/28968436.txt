Madeleine Isaksson (born 1956) is a Swedish/French composer.


== Biography ==
Madeleine Isaksson studied at the Royal Academy of Music in Stockholm from 1979 to 1987. She received a diploma as a piano and ensemble teacher after studying under Gunnar Hallhagen, and then studied composition under teachers including Gunnar Bucht and Sven-David Sandström (composition), Pär Lindgren (electroacoustic music), Arne Mellnäs (instrumentation), and Bo Wallner (music theory and analysis). In 1987 she lived in Amsterdam for a year of studies with the composer Louis Andriessen. Meetings with composers at different composition courses in Europe, Brian Ferneyhough, Iannis Xenakis, Morton Feldman and Emmanuel Nunes, have all contributed to Isaksson’s development as a composer. In the early 1990s, she moved to France, where she lives and works near Paris.
