In 2001, Amato, along with keyboardist Mathieu Charbonneau and percussionist Julien Poissant, formed Torngat, his longest standing musical project.  The band self-released music for several years before signing with the Alien8 label.In 2006 Amati performed with the Bell Orchestre at the Montreal Jazz Festival, and promoted the group's release Recording a Tape the Colour of the Light  with a March tour in Europe and a May tour of the US. In April he toured with Torngat in Eastern Canada, promoting the album La Rouge. In July a stand-in temporarily replaced Amato for Bell Orchestre's European tour while he participated in the recording of Torngat's 2007 album, You Could Be.
In 2007 Amato toured in March with Arcade Fire in Canada, promoting Neon Bible. Then he was on the road again with The Luyas in Ontario, to promote that band's recently released Faker Death.  That year Amato and the Bell Orchestra were nominated for a Juno Award for their work in Recording a Tape the Colour of the Light. 
Torngat's You Could Be was released in 2007, and late 2007 and early 2008 Amato toured with the band in Eastern Canada and New York City in support of that album. 
By 2009, Torngat had released another album, La Petite Nicole; the trio conducting spring and fall tours around Canada and the U. S. to promote it.  Amato also toured in April, May and July with Bell Orchestre in Canada and parts of the US to promote their release As Seen Through Windows, which won best instrumental album at the Juno Awards in 2010.
In 2011 Amato was on the road again with The Luyas from March to May promoting Too Beautiful to Work, touring in Canada and the US before moving on to Europe.
