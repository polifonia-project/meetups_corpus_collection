From 1982, for ten years, she was a student at the ITC Sangeet Research Academy in Kolkata where she was taught by K. G. Ginde and Bhowmick. She learned thumri rendition from D. T. Joshi. In spite of the macho nature of the Agra gharana style of music, with her own sense of layakari (rhythmic play) and strong tone, she became proficient by creating her own style of gayaki under the guidance of Vijay Kichlu, director of the academy. She joined the academy as guru and taught between 1992 and 2003 and again in recent years. She is the only woman student of the Academy to be appointed as a guru in the same institution.Guha has performed in many concerts nationally and also in the US, Europe, and Asia.
