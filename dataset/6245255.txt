== Early life and career ==
Beatriz Luengo was born in Madrid in December 1982. The daughter of Angelines and Juan, she grew up and lived in the district of Hortaleza. In her free time, she played on the district basketball team.
When she was six years old she began to be interested in show business, after seeing a TV broadcast of the musical film Cabaret starring Liza Minnelli, who became a role model. She trained at the Royal Academy of Dance, where she studied ballet, jazz dance, Funky and flamenco.
When she was ten, she formed a musical group called Tatu with two childhood friends. They recorded a CD but the record label went out of business and their debut album was not released. Disappointed, Luengo gave up attending casting calls. After months, she successfully auditioned as a dancer for the Rita and Miliki Circus.
She danced on different TV spots for Televisión Española and was the singer in the TV program Esto Me Suena. She performed in musicals such as La Magia de Broadway I and II, Annie, Jekyll & Hyde, Hermanos de Sangre, and Peter Pan. During her stage performances she had the chance to work with Luis Ramirez, musical directors Alberto Quintero and Cesar Belda, and choreographer Luka Yesi.

The second single from the album was "Go Away", a song written by American Pop star Justin Timberlake, and peaked at #1 on the Spanish Singles Chart. The third and final single was "Hit Lerele", an R&B song which peaked at #4 in Spain.
The album peaked at #20 in Spain, and sold in excess 30,000 copies, a commercial failure for Luengo and her label. Mi Generación had an exclusive release in France via FNAC stores, and peaked at #4 on the FNAC Top 20 without any form of promotion.
She won the prize "Better Musical Future", and she was chosen by the Spanish audience to represent Spain at the "Wanadoo Discoveries" in Nice, where she placed second. She was nominated to the MTV European Music Awards celebrated in Lisbon. She was invited in 2005 to the Grammy Awards and in 2006 to Cannes Festival.
In 2006, after the success of "Un Paso Adelante" in France, Universal released an edition of Mi Generación there, called BL. The lead single was "Hit Lerele", which peaked at #14 in France with sales of more than 90,000 copies. The second single was "Escape", and did also well on the charts, peaking at #14, selling 90,000 copies.
The album was released in mid-2006, and peaked at #7, selling 130,000 copies and being certified as Gold. The third and final single from BL was the R&B song "May Yo Lo", featuring Ruzzo from Orishas. However, this was only a promo single for French music stations; it did well on some radio stations.
The album peaked at #58 on the European Top 100 Albums Chart, and the single "Hit Lerele" was a Top 50 hit on the European Hot 100 Singles Chart.
