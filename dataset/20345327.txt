== Biography ==
Mike was a de facto member of Rilo Kiley from 2004–2005, touring with the band to support their 2004 record, More Adventurous. During this time, he also appeared on several late night TV show performances with the band.
Blake Sennett of Rilo Kiley approached Bloom with home demos which would eventually become 2004's The Elected record, Me First. While in Sennet's home studio one day Blake handed Bloom a lap steel, which was a gift from Jenny Lewis. While Bloom says he had never played one before, he "instantly took to it and what we recorded that day ended up on the first Elected record." Released by Sub Pop, the songs were recorded at Elliott Smith’s studio with Bright Eyes' Mike Mogis and The Postal Service’s Jimmy Tamborello. Bloom co-produced, mixed, and played various instruments on all three Elected records, much of which was done during off days on the road with Rilo Kiley, with Mike and Blake’s mobile recording rig. Other contributions or touring members of The Elected included Jason Boesel (of Rilo Kiley), Orenda Fink (of Azure Ray), Daniel Brummel, and Michael Runion.Bloom joined Julian Casablancas in 2009 as a touring guitar player in support of Casablancas' solo record, Phrazes for the Young'. He also performed on the Casablancas single "I Like the Night", an original song, written for Azzaro's men's fragrance, Decibel, dB.
Bloom's debut solo album, King of Circles, was released in June 2011 on Rilo Kiley's bassist Pierre de Reeder's label, Little Record Company. The New York Daily News drew comparisons to Harry Nilsson and The Byrds' "70s brand of singer-songwriting folk rock patented on the West Coast" with "scenic guitar work and sumptuous melodies" and "expertly displayed and deceivingly complex acoustic picking." Bloom wrote and played all of the instruments on the record, which also features Jenny Lewis, who co-wrote "Butchers Paper", and string arrangements from Bright Eyes' Nate Walcott.Bloom played guitar, lap steel and vocals, in addition to serving as musical director for Jenny Lewis in support of 2014's The Voyager.The Elected reunited for a one-off show opening for Morrissey at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in 2015 and then again in 2018 opening for Azure Ray in Los Angeles at their reunion show held at the Lodge Room.
