== Musical career ==


=== Early career with Al Stewart ===
Born in Luton, England, White first gained fame with his distinctive guitar style as accompanist to singer/songwriter Al Stewart. He started in Stewart's band in 1975 at the age of 20, then relocated to Los Angeles in 1978. During a 20-year tenure with Stewart, he co-wrote many songs, including Stewart's 1978 top-ten hit "Time Passages" and “Midnight Rocks” (which reached #24 on the US charts) in 1980. That same year he formed Shot In The Dark, a band which backed Stewart and released an eponymous album in 1981.


=== Basia ===
In 1984 White’s brother Danny White invited him to play on the Matt Bianco debut album Whose Side Are You On?. He played acoustic guitar (uncredited) on the song "Half A Minute" featuring vocalist Basia. This recording marked the first time that the two brothers had collaborated musically. In 1987 White continued his association with Basia by playing guitar on her Time and Tide album, co-produced by his brother Danny. He subsequently played on all of Basia’s following studio albums and joined her on two world tours, in 1990 and 1994. In 1996 Basia returned the favor by singing on White's album Caravan of Dreams, on the single "Just Another Day".


=== Producing and Solo Work ===
In 1989 White co-produced the album “The Clock and the Moon” by singer Skipper Wise. In return Wise co-produced White’s first two solo albums, Reveillez-Vous in 1990 and Excusez-Moi in 1992.  Many other solo albums by Peter White followed which resulted in several songs reaching the top of the Billboard Smooth Jazz Songs chart. #1 hits include  "Midnight in Manhattan", featuring Grover Washington, Jr. (1998), "What Does It Take (To Win Your Love)" featuring Sam Riney (2006), "Mister Magic" featuring Bob James (2007), "Bright" (2009), "Good Day (2010), "Here We Go" featuring Dave Sanborn (2012), "Head Over Heels" featuring Rick Braun (2014), and "Do I Do" (2017).Even after releasing three solo CDs, White continued to work with Al Stewart and Basia, eventually co-producing Stewart’s Famous Last Words CD in 1993. As a solo artist White has recorded and performed with many other instrumental artists including Boney James, Rick Braun, Richard Elliot, Grover Washington Jr., Gerald Albright, Dave Koz, and Brian Culbertson.In 1981, White met Creed Bratton, a founding member of The Grass Roots. Over the next decade, White used his home studio to record many of Bratton’s songs, playing guitar and keyboards. These songs were eventually compiled into 3 CDs: Coarsegold, Chasin’ the Ball, and The 80’s, released in 2001 and 2002. The CDs marked Bratton’s debut as a solo artist 30 years after he had left The Grass Roots.
