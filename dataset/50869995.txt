Noah Solomon Chase (born 1973) is an Israeli–American musician, best known as the lead singer, guitarist, and mandolinist for the Jewish rock band Soulfarm.


== Early life ==
Chase was born in Northern California before moving with his family to Mevo Modi'in, Israel, a communal village founded by musician and spiritual leader Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, who frequently visited the village. He comes from a family of musicians; his father, Ben Zion Solomon, was a founding member of Diaspora Yeshiva Band (whose debut album features Chase as  a child soloist), while his brothers include Moshav Band's Yehuda Solomon and Hamakor's Nachman Solomon.He began seriously pursuing music as a teenager. At age 16, he was seen practicing by Carlebach, who invited him to play at some of his shows. He subsequently became Carlebach's official guitarist for the last two years before his death in 1994.

Solomon met American guitarist and fellow Carlebach disciple C Lanzbom at a Purim party in Mevo Modi'im, and attended a music class taught by him in Jerusalem in the 1980s. The two later moved to New York City and formed Inasense (later Soulfarm) in 1991. They have released eight albums, as well as five albums as Lanzbom Solomon. Alongside Moshav Band and Blue Fringe, they have been credited with advancing Jewish rock in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

In 2013, Solomon provided musical accompaniment for Tisha B'Av services at The Brownstone in East Village, Manhattan, alongside Neshama Carlebach, Basya Schechter, and Naomi Less.
