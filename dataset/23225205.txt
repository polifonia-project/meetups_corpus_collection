In 1994, he won the Society for Music Theory's Outstanding Publication Award for his article, "Transpositional Combination of Beat-Class Sets in Steve Reich’s Phase-Shifting Music," and he won it again in 1997 for "Maximally Smooth Cycles, Hexatonic Systems, and the Analysis of Late-Romantic Triadic Progressions."Cohn was the founding editor (2004–14) of Oxford Studies in Music Theory, and edited the Journal of Music Theory until 2014. He is the author of Audacious Euphony: Chromatic Harmony and the Triad's Second Nature (Oxford, 2012).
