== Biography ==
Mezdawi's first band Annusur, translates to The Eagles, released their first album "Ughniyat an Elghurba" in 1975 gaining instant popularity that rewarded them their first gold record. Mezdawi went on to participate in several international music festivals, giving concerts in Mexico, Cuba,  USA, Portugal Malta and Greece. Nasser El Mezdawi is arguably the most popular artist that came out of Libya in the mid seventies.  His work has been appreciated by the younger generation in urban North Africa and other Arab countries.
Much of his early work has been copied by other performers from the region, in fact, some very popular performers started out their careers, almost exclusively, covering his songs. This distinguished guitarist who survived trends, hype and persecution is one of few consistent composers, singers/songwriters that have put their mark, permanently, in the history of music in the region.
Darja, the Arabic dialect of North Africa, is the lyrical language of this sound. While the music is not necessarily Arabic, the rhythms are often mixtures of Berber, Arab, African and popular European. Artists usually reflect their diverse ethnic backgrounds through their own distinguishable work. The progressive sound remained local for the most part but Mezdawi's music broke into the international market through other Arab and European performers.
Nasser El Mezdawi is a pioneer in this form of music whom, many believe, is responsible for transforming the way young, urban Arab performers view and express their music today. QTF-1998
