The Dukes' first offering was their self-titled album The Amboy Dukes which charted. It featured their first charting single "Baby, Please Don't Go", an intense cover of a Big Joe Williams song. The second album was Journey to the Center of the Mind a psychedelic rock opera that was their highest charting album and produced their most commercially successful single. The third album was Migration. Although not a commercial success, it showed a refinement of both Farmer's songwriting skills and Nugent's songwriting and guitar skills. All three albums (released by Mainstream Records) featured Farmer touches in words and music that emphasized psychedelic imagery, so central to late sixties pop culture.
