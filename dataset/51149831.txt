Smino names Kanye West, André 3000 and Lil Wayne as his biggest musical influences, as well as his cousin, Drea Smith. In an interview with Pitchfork he stated, "I grew up in the church, so it was a bunch of gospel along with Musiq Soulchild, Em, T-Pain—just a bunch of soulful dudes that are country. My first favorite rapper was Ludacris."


=== Musical style ===
Scott Glaysher of Exclaim! described his music is a "mix of smart rapping and crowd-pleasing, futuristic R&B grooves." Jay Balfour from Pitchfork said he focuses "on his incredibly versatile voice within a warm palette of sludgy R&B and neo-funk" and "throws a million different voices into the mix." Rolling Stone said "his rap makes room for southern R&B and imperfect harmony singing; the drums are inevitably cooled out, like nth-wave neo soul."
