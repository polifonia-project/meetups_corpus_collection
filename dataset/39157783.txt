== Early years ==
The band met and formed as school friends in 2008. They would rehearse in a space in Stevie Appleby's back garden and quickly began to write and record their own material. Initially the band self-released a couple of EPs which in turn caught the attention of major record labels in the UK. Their first UK release was a 7" version of The John Wayne on the Young and Lost Club label, which was produced by David Kosten and contained the b-side Glass Case. The band played many shows and rehearsals for many labels, but felt the right home for them was New York based label Glassnote. Daniel Glass made several trips to Ireland to meet with the band and they signed with the label in January 2012. The band were named on the prestigious BBC sound poll for 2013, along with Haim, Savages and Chvrches.
