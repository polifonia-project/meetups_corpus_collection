=== "My Life In Your Hands" ===
In August 2003, Jamie was accused for incorrect lyrics involving one of its songs, "My Life In Your Hands" from her 2001 album, Seasons. The song was composed by Kathy Troccoli and Bill Montvilo, and originally performed by Troccoli in 1994 and later by Kirk Franklin in 1997. In Jamie's version of that song, the lyrics was eventually changed, including the words "People" replacing "Keeping" and "Love" replaces "Hope" in the chorus, and the word "Stone" replacing "Lord" in the coda. Careers-BMG Music Publishing and Floating Note Music, publishers of that song, did not granting the permission for inclusion of the song in the album released by her label, Star Records. In addition, they eventually misspelled the composers' names in the album's liner notes. Narciso Chan, the sales and marketing director of BMG Pilipinas (now Sony Music Philippines) says that the incorrect lyrics, the misspelling of the song's composers and uncrediting of the publishers of the song "My Life In Your Hands" is 'blatantly illegal' under the United States copyright laws. Nixon Sy, Star Records' assistant marketing director, did not receive the letter from Mr. Chan and the company had decline to comment. Star Records' VP for operations Annabelle Regaldo, managing director Enrico Santos and marketing director Heinrich Ngo said that her album Seasons will reissued with correct lyrics of the song "My Life In Your Hands" in October 2003, with the correction of the song composers' names and inclusion of the publisher's credits in the album's liner notes, as well as three additional tracks for the 2003 re-release of the album.
