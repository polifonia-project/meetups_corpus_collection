Mick Hutton (born 5 June 1956 in Chester, UK) is a British jazz bassist and composer.


== Career ==
Hutton is known from the British jazz scene by his work with Harry Beckett (Pictures of You, 1985) and with Julian Argüelles, Iain Ballamy, Django Bates and Ken Stubbs (First House), the Chris Biscoe Sextet and Bill Bruford's Band Earthworks. In addition, Hutton worked throughout his career with Alan Barnes, Peter Erskine, Tina May, Jim Mullen, John Scofield, Alan Skidmore, Tommy Smith, John Taylor, Stan Tracey, and Kenny Wheeler. In 2002 he played on Robin Williamsons album Skirting the River Road, and the same year he played in a trio with Martin Speake and Paul Motian (Change of Heart).
A hand injury forced him to abandon the upright bass. He started working as bass guitarist, percussionist, and synthesizer player and as a composer. He works with his own band of saxophonist Andy Panayi, pianist Barry Green, and drummer Paul Robinson. With his quartet, including Iain Ballamy (saxes), Ross Stanley (piano) and Paul Robinson (drums), he frequently visits venues around the world.
