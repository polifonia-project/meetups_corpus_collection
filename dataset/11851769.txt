Camp was raised in Perryville, Arkansas by a musical family. In 1987, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee and worked in the backing bands of such acts as The Grand Prairie Boys, Osborne Brothers, Alan Jackson, Suzy Bogguss and Trisha Yearwood. In 1991, he was signed to Reprise Records, with two minor Top 40 singles charting in 1993. The first of these, "Fallin' Never Felt So Good", was previously recorded by Dude Mowrey.
Camp recorded a second album for Reprise, but never released it due to creative differences. He then began writing for other artists. Camp's first Number One as a songwriter came in early 1998, when Garth Brooks reached the top of the Billboard country charts with "Two Pi√±a Coladas", a song co-written by Camp. Later that same year, Brooks & Dunn also reached Number One with "How Long Gone", another Camp co-write.Camp released Lucky Silver Dollar in 2001. In 2006, he was nominated as Songwriter of the Year by the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music; also, Billboard ranked him No. 10 on their 2006 list of Hot Country Songwriters. The same year, two songs co-written by Camp entered the country charts: "Nobody But Me" by Blake Shelton, and "Would You Go with Me" by Josh Turner, which peaked at No. 4 and No. 1, respectively, on the Billboard U.S. Hot Country Songs charts. Camp also co-wrote Turner's 2007 single "Firecracker", George Strait's 2008 single "River of Love", and Billy Currington's 2011 single "Love Done Gone".
Since early 2007, Camp has been collaborating with country legend Loretta Lynn writing songs such as "I'm Dyin for Someone to Live For" and "I'm More Alone When I'm With You" together.
