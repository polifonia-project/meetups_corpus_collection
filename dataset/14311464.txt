A jam session with The Waterboys' Mike Scott turned into a recurring relationship, including recording and extensive touring during their halcyon Fisherman's Blues period. Patti Smith Group fans Indigo Girls recruited Daugherty to play on their Grammy Award winning multi-platinum second album, Indigo Girls. Re-locating to Sydney, he was a member of Australian rock band The Church from 1990â€“1993.Since Patti Smith's re-emergence in 1995, Daugherty has continued to perform with her as a musician, co-writer, and co-producer.
