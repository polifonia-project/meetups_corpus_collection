== Early life ==
Henshaw was born in London, England and was raised by Nigerian parents in South London. Henshaw grew up with music but not in the conventional sense. Nobody in his household played an instrument but there was always sound running through the house, which highly influenced his musical nature. Samm essentially found his love for music and learned to play instruments in his church pastored by his father, where he developed his abilities further. Henshaw spent his secondary years at Cleeve Park School, then went on to study a popular music performance degree at Southampton Solent.
