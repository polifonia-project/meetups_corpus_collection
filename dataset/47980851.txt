== Early life ==
Sabina Ddumba was born on 23 February 1994 in Fisks√§tra, Nacka. She is the sixth child out of eight in her family. Her mother is Ugandan, and when she was eight years old, her mother moved back to Uganda. After listening to traditional Ugandan nursery rhymes and songs, she became interested in melody and phrasing. Ddumba has started writing songs since she was 10. In 2008, at the age of fourteen, she joined the Tensta Gospel Choir, and sang with the group for about six years. It was through this choir that she found singing was her vocation. Her father and relatives wanted her to pursue a more scholarly profession, such as a doctor.


== Musical influences ==
Ddumba was inspired by the Ugandan nursery rhymes and songs she heard when she was a child. She also grew up listening to the hip hop and R&B of the late 1990s. As her family was religious, the gospel music she heard in church on Sundays has also greatly influenced her musical style. Her time with the Tensta Gospel Choir strengthened the influence that gospel music has had on her work.
