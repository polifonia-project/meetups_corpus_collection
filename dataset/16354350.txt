== Early life ==
Pelton was born in Kansas City, Missouri.
"I grew up always banging on things," Pelton said describing his childhood. His first real musical instrument was a cello in 5th grade. But he "bailed as soon as possible to the drums," Pelton said. "I was running around doing gigs at 14, which was a great situation, to actually be in a band that young. The sooner you start making music with other people the better."


== Musical education ==
In 1985, Pelton earned a bachelor's degree and a Performer's Certificate after his studies at Indiana University's Jacobs School of Music in Bloomington, Indiana, according to Drummerworld. While there, Pelton studied with Kenny Aronoff, who at the time was the drummer for John Mellencamp, Drummerworld reported. Mellencamp lives just a short distance away from Bloomington. During summer break, Pelton sought out experts elsewhere. "I also had the privilege of hanging with Alan Dawson for a couple of summers," he told Edge. The Massachusetts-based Dawson, legendary in the jazz world, may best be known as an early teacher of Tony Williams—drummer for Miles Davis.
During his time as a student, Pelton taught for a brief period as well as conducted private drum lessons. One of his students was Pete Wilhoit, who would later become a member of Fiction Plane, the opening act for The Police on their 2007 reunion global tour.


== Saturday Night Live ==
He joined the Saturday Night Live band in 1992, saying "It’s a pretty mellow gig...It’s really only 20 days out of the year."Since 2007, Pelton has been regularly appearing as the drummer on Daryl Hall's internet concert series Live from Daryl's House.
Nicknamed "Cat Daddy"[1] by drum tech, Tim Soya.Pelton also served periodically as the substitute drummer in the CBS Orchestra on Late Show with David Letterman during regular drummer Anton Fig's absences.
Pelton is also a founding member of the NYC-based band The Cringe.
