Matias Tellez is a Norwegian singer songwriter, composer and record producer.  Matias is one of the many young artists that the press have called the Bergen Wave. His music contains elements of pop, rock and tropicalia. He released solo music until starting the band Young Dreams, in which he is the principal songwriter and producer.


== Background ==
Matias's parents, both from Chile moved to Norway as political refugees, and his style is heavily influenced by South American sounds, bossa nova, tropicalia and artists such as Os Mutantes, Los Gatos, Jorge Ben, Caetano Veloso.
Matias started playing violin at the age of six, piano aged seven, but found what would become his preferred instrument when he picked up his fathers guitar at twelve. At the age of thirteen Matias entered the Eggstock battle of the bands with his band Frustration To Creation, where he came second, winning the opportunity to record a demo at Tinitus Studios in Bergen.  The demo was heard by HP Gundersen and Kato Ådland, who has discovered Bergen bands such as Sondre Lerche, Nathalie Nordnes and Real Ones, who worked with Matias over the following years.


== Career ==
Aged fourteen Matias released his first single 'Singing La la la la la'  produced by HP Gundersen and Kato Ådland, on their label New Records.  Tellez then played many concerts around Bergen including at By:larm 2004, which led to shows all over Norway including the Øya Festival in Oslo.  From the age of thirteen to sixteen Matias wrote and recorded 3 albums which were never released, but resulted in the EP 'Matias Tellez' on New Records.
In 2007 Matias released his first full album Tamias Mellez on Gjøa Recordings/Sonet and through Flake Records in Japan.  The album received modest reviews but featured the single Brand New Kicks which was entered into the national radio station NRK P3's annual new music competition Urørt.  Matias won the 2008 competition, which had been won the previous year by Ida Maria, and brought Matias much national media attention and radio play.
In 2008 Matias signed to Sony Music and on 16 February 2009 released the album 'Clouds', which reached number thirty on the VG Topp30 Album list. The singles from that album, 'Convicted' and 'Hello' both received heavy airtime on national radio
