== Controversy ==


=== Young Buck ===
On September 20, 2011, Lil Zane said on Street Disciplez Radio, G-Unit CEO 50 Cent would have made more money by signing him over former group member Young Buck. In addition to revealing his interest in working with 50 Cent, Zane also taunted Buck's music."Yo, he's garbage, he's garbage," Zane told radio host EI8HT referring to Young Buck. "He's garbage though, I don't think he's a good rapper. He might be a good person but you know, he probably feels the same way about me. So the feeling's mutual, you know? But I don't think he's the best rapper. I think I would have made 50 Cent a little more money. I think 50 needs to sign me, man. I think it needs to be 50 & 60 Cent or something because I'm more like 60 Cent. You know what I'm saying?


=== Game & Tyler, The Creator ===
In September 2011, on an interview with DJ Vlad, Game named Lil Zane one of the wackest rappers. Zane responded on a freestyle over the song "Niggas in Paris". In the freestyle he disses not only the Game but also Tyler, The Creator.
