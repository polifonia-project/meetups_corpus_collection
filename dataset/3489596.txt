His album, Don’t Be Scared (BBE, 2012) was praised for the "inventiveness of the beats" (incorporating dubstep, breaks, bhangra, Afrobeat and vintage house) by Q reviewer Paul McGee who rated it 4/5 and tagged "The One to Buy!"He has made many remixes from The Cure, Erykah Badu, Alice Russell, Paul Weller, Prince, and CL Smooth.On average he performs 170-180 shows a year and has played in over 63 countries.In 2020, Vadim was interviewed by the Data.Wave webzine.


== Style ==
DJ Vadim composes both music for MCs, singers and poets and soulful instrumental hip-hop beats.  In both cases, certain stylistic trends emerge;

Dominating rhythmic percussion, heavy use of drum programming which are sometimes broken or stuttering, heavy bass and synthesizer use.
Organic, soulful touches often using studio musicians, with undertones of roots reggae and ragga and driving, hip-hop drum orchestration.
Original sounding compositions, arrangements that fuse many genres from hip-hop and electronica to soul and reggae.
Heavy use of ethnic sounds, including Asian, South American and African."Anyone recalling Sly & Robbie's mid-80s exercises in electro-dub fusion might see DJ Vadim’s latest as almost an update of that aesthetic," Paul McGee wrote in Q, reviewing Don’t Be Scared LP (2012).
