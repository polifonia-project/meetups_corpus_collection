Ethan John Luck is an American musician, producer, multi-instrumentalist and photographer who has played in several bands, most prominently, the ska band The O.C. Supertones, Christian metal  band Demon Hunter, and pop punk band Relient K. He has played on albums for Demon Hunter, Kutless, Roper, Nikki Clan and Last Tuesday.


== Background ==
Luck and fellow Supertones alumnus Daniel Spencer ran Rebel Waltz Recording Co., a recording studio based in Franklin, Tennessee. Artists that recorded there included Flatfoot 56, August Burns Red, The Send, The Lonely Hearts and many others.  Luck and Spencer also had a short-lived, Nashville-based punk band called My Red Hot Nightmare. Luck continues his love of recording and engineered and produced Supertones singer Matt Morginsky's first solo record.
On February 12, 2008, Luck announced on his personal website that would be the new drummer for pop punk band Relient K. The band also made the announcement on their website. Luck also posted a letter to Demon Hunter fans about his future in the band. In August 2009, Luck and Don Clark decided to depart as guitarists from Demon Hunter. Luck and Clark's schedule's with Relient K and Invisible Creature, respectively, made it hard to keep up with Demon Hunter and their other projects.
In 2012, Luck began working on a new solo punk/ska/reggae project under the name Ethan Luck and the High Pressure System. The first single is "Hey Mr. Pharisee".On April 21, 2013, Luck posted that he would no longer be with Relient K.Luck runs two podcasts, the general music-themed The Pirate Satellite, and the Metallica-themed Metal Up Your Podcast, shared with fellow Nashville musician Clint Wells.Luck and his wife are vegan.
