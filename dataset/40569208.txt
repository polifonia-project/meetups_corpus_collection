== Career ==

Moen was born in Kristiansand. He has been involved in a series of metal bands, and is now associate professor in performing rhythmic piano at the University of Agder.Within his own studio ("Studio 3014") and own label (BAM Records), he made his debut as solo artist in 2011, with three album releases, Closure featuring recordings from the period 2006–10, together with Fredrik Sahlander (bass) and Trygve Tambs-Lychè (drums), except the uptempo avalanche "FXG", where Geir Åge Johnsen takes care of the drums. The two solo albums are from a more resent date, recorded January (Vol.1) and in May (Vol.2). The repertoire on both is dominated by relatively short improvisations, often lyrical, quiet and with very deliberate use of pauses. But both are also proceeding showing a pianist with technique, including sound therapy, which enables him to exploit the instrument's sonic potential of slender tone migrations to deafening crescendi with his speedy fingers.
