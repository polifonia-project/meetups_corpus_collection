Nicolas Chaix, also known by his  alias I:Cube, is a French DJ and an electronic music producer.
Paris based, he first gained limelight on Paris' underground dance scene in the mid to late 1990s, most notably through his remix of "Around The World" by Daft Punk in 1997. Daft Punk had remixed one of his titles, "Disco Cubizm", in 1996.

In 1996, DJ Gilb'R, who then a programmer at Radio Nova, received a demo cassette from I:Cube. Gilb'R was impressed, so he made him the first artist of his newly created label, Versatile. By 1997, Versatile had released several of I:Cube's records. Chaix and Cohen eventually began to collaborate as Château Flight (French: Château Flight, lit. 'Castle Flight').  Their first album, Puzzle was released by Versatile on October 30, 2001.
