=== Early life ===
Fujii was born in Kawasaki City, Japan to an American father of Japanese and Swiss descent and a Japanese mother. Fujii has a younger brother, Arthur. As a high school student, she traveled to Switzerland to study English following bullying by her Japanese classmates, who would make comments such as "You're a fat one [foreigner] but you don't speak English". In Switzerland, she was also subject to bullying and racism, particularly from one female classmate, who would make racist comments.
