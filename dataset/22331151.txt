== Early life ==
Dorrough Music was born in Dallas, Texas, United States, at Baylor Hospital. Being the youngest of eleven kids, at the age of 7, he developed a strong interest in basketball and played the sport until he was 18. Although he had a love for music, it was not until high school that he developed an interest in creating and writing music, in which he started off mixing mixtapes for close friends that were rappers until he discovered his own talent as a writer and performer. He attended Lancaster High School in Lancaster, where he was captain of the basketball team and became popular from playing his music at games and selling mixtapes during school hours. He also attended Prairie View A&M University where he gained regional stardom through building a student fan base that spread throughout the south, though he did not graduate.
