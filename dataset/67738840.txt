Her grandmother was a singer and taught her the traditional style of singing known as 'white voice' and her grandfather played the accordion. Her mother also sang in a folk choir.During her time at school she studied singing and was encouraged by her teachers to become an opera singer, however she realised she wanted to become a rock musician. She was in a local rock band as a teen and performed in several concerts.

In early 2020, Pavlenko, along with the band, competed in Vidbir 2020, the Ukrainian National Selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 with the song "Solovey".
