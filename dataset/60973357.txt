"The plaintiff admitted that he bullied defendant 'K' during his 5th year in elementary school using verbal attacks; however, the plaintiff denied 'K's claims that he threatened 'K' with scissors or a box cutter. The plaintiff admitted that he pushed 'K' in the chest with his hands, then went on to kick 'K' in the chest with his foot, but maintained the position that 'K' raised the bullying accusations on online communities with malicious intent by making the incident seem more serious than it was."

'K' was able to provide a detailed and descriptive account of the incident; 2. The principal of the school at the time remembered this incident and submitted a voice recording as evidence; 3. Other witnesses also testified in 'K's favor."

On January 13, 2022 Kim Dong-hee revealed his position and posted a apology on the suspicion of school violence. He stated:

"Hello. This is Kim Dong-hee.
I would like to state my position on the matter reported yesterday.
When I was in the 5th grade of elementary school, I got into a fight with my classmate in the classroom, and I was disciplined by my teacher. Upon hearing this news, my mother scolded me greatly, and I went to my friend's house with my mother to apologize to my friend and my friend's mother.
After that, I thought that my friend and her mother had forgiven me because I went to the study room with my friend, not only had classes, but also ate dinner with my friend's family and spent a lot of time together without any problems.
I didn't know I was the only one thinking. I couldn't fathom the scars left behind by those people.
After the post was posted last year, I wanted to apologize to my friend right away for this, but I didn't have the courage to apologize for all the things I didn't do as well as the truth and fear that it would cause another misunderstanding. I also want to spend the past year.
It seems that I did not deeply understand the heart of my friend due to my rash judgment and thoughts when I was young. I sincerely apologize for the hurt that friend has inflicted on me, and I want to solve it in the future.

Also, I deeply reflect and apologize to those who were hurt by my immature words and actions as a child."
