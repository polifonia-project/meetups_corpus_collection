Roselle Paulino Nava-Tan (born March 28, 1976), professionally and more commonly known as Roselle Nava, is a Filipino singer, film and television actress, and politician. She is a multi-platinum female singer in the Philippines and one of the most in-demand divas during the 90s era. She is tagged as the "Philippines' Sentimental Diva" and the "former supreme songbird of ABS-CBN". She was formerly dubbed as the "90s Philippine Pop Queen". She started her career as a part of ABS-CBN's defunct youth-oriented show Ang TV (1992–1997) together with Jolina Magdangal, Claudine Barretto, Antoinette Taus, etc. She was also a regular host and performer of ASAP, the Philippines longest variety show, from 1995 to 2004 and since 2015.
She is the singer behind the hits like Bakit Nga Ba Mahal Kita, Maniniwala Ba Ako, Dahil Mahal Na Mahal Kita, Laging Ikaw Parin, Ikaw Pala, Mahal Mo Ba'y Di Na Ako, and Huwag Ka Nang Babalik.


== Showbiz career ==
From 1994 to 1995, she was hailed as the Best Female Singer of the Year for the song You by Awit Awards. In 1994, her very first signature hit, Bakit Nga Ba Mahal Kita (Why Do I Love You?), became the number one charted song in the Philippines and stayed in the radio charts for 8 months from 1994 to 1995. It became the theme song of many Filipinos who went through heart breaks and got lost in love.
In 1997, however her commercialized success of Dahil Mahal Na Mahal Kita, her carrier single from her 3rd album (Roselle: On Higher Ground), emerged immediate success and even spanned a film with the same name and even in album registry.
To date, Dahil Mahal Na Mahal Kita was also covered four times by different artists: Rachelle Ann Go for The Gulong Ng Palad (2006) Soundtrack and Zsa Zsa Padilla's rendition for the Afternoon Soap theme Magkano Ang Iyong Dangal? in 2010, in 2013 by Vice Ganda for the soundtrack of the Primetime series Huwag Ka Lang Mawawala, and in 2018, Jonalyn Viray (aka Jona), for the teleserye Asintado.
In 2000, she revived the Barry Manilow song "Somewhere Down The Road" for the Blockbuster Film "Minsan Minahal Kita" which also was included in the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack; and in 2002, her comeback platinum hit with Star Records "Huwag Ka Nang Magbabalik for the film Ngayong Nandito Ka and Jologs.
In 2002, Roselle was chosen as the interpreter for the song, Free, composed by Gino Torres. The demo version was recorded by Carol Banawa. But the composer chose Roselle to do the final and live version. It became as one of the finalists of ABS-CBN's JAM: Himig Handog sa Makabagong Kabataan. It also became the theme song of ABS-CBN's summer station ID in the same year.
Roselle Nava's last album with Star Records (ABS-CBN's recording outfit) All About Love achieved the Platinum Status but was never awarded to her. She moved to Viva Entertainment Agency and signed up for several projects. VIVA did not commercialise her artistry as her recent albums got no awards. The poor sales performance of her albums affected her singing career.
In 2010, Bakit Nga Ba Mahal Kita was also re-recorded by Laarni Lozada for the Afternoon Drama "Alyna"; and Kakai Bautista, Philippines' Dental Diva, as her carrier single for her debut album under Star Music in 2017.


=== Vocal profile ===
Roselle's voice can be classified as soprano as her style is very similar with Regine Velasquez's singing prowess. She suffered from a throat virus which affected the brilliance of her voice. She was able to cope up through healing sessions and support of her fans.


=== Recent trends ===
In 2009, she was part of the talked-about successful concert entitled "Divas of the 90s", produced by VIVA Entertainment Company. Her co-performers were Geneva Cruz, Jessa Zaragoza, and Rachel Alejandro.
On February 13, 2016, she also had a successful concert with other OPM icons entitled LOVE THROWBACK held in PICC (Philippine International Convention Center).
On February 4, 2018, Roselle was given a tribute by ASAP as one of the OPM gems in the country. She sang her signature hits with ABS-CBN's homegrown talents. The tribute showed how she started as a prime diva of ABS-CBN and what's her life now. Roselle was awarded a plaque of recognition with her contribution to OPM.
