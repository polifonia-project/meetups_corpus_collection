Patrick Driscoll (born June 28, 1987), known professionally as Blank Banshee, is a Canadian artist, musician and producer from Saint John, New Brunswick. He rose to popularity in 2012 with his album Blank Banshee 0, which combined traditional elements of vaporwave with trap music, a style now known as vaportrap. Blank Banshee's music has been described as a "balance of abstract ambience and dance-able trap".


== Career ==


=== Blank Banshee 0 ===
In 2010, Driscoll began performing live as "Blank Banshees" (formerly Shinjuku MAD) along with collaborator Curtis "Cormorant" Ferguson. In April 2011, Blank Banshees were featured performers on the Electro East Stage of the 2011 East Coast Music Awards. In the summer of 2012, Driscoll moved from his hometown to the Canadian west coast where he released his debut album Blank Banshee 0 as the solo artist "Blank Banshee".  The production style helped bring the vaporwave sub-genre dubbed "vaportrap" to prominence in the latter half of 2012. The track "Teen Pregnancy" appeared in a 2016 viral video associated with Simpsonwave and again in a 2020 TikTok trend.


=== Blank Banshee 1 ===
Following the release of Blank Banshee 0, Driscoll began work on his second album, Blank Banshee 1, released October 20, 2013. The Fader called Blank Banshee 1 "a masterwork of the new digital psychedelia" and a "definitive document of the vaporwave era".  Beginning on the eve of the album's release, a series of six self-produced computer animated music videos were uploaded to the official Blank Banshee YouTube channel. A 2016 Esquire article cited Blank Banshee's musical style as an example of the "direction that vaporwave has moved in, where the trap beat is emphasized and the political edge blunted".


=== MEGA ===
In 2014, Driscoll began work on his third studio album, Mega, in Vancouver where he is based as of 2016. The album was released October 20, 2016. COMPLEX named Mega the "best release from the project yet". He completed an accompanying tour spanning Europe and North America called "The Mega Tour" in 2017.
