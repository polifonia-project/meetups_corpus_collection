Ryan DeRobertis (known by his stage name Skylar Spence and formerly known as Saint Pepsi) is an American electronic musician and singer who grew up in Farmingville, New York and attended Boston College for two years studying music. His electronic music project Saint Pepsi began in December 2012. As Saint Pepsi, he released his ninth studio album Hit Vibes in May 2013. He is a current resident of Brooklyn, New York.


== Career ==
Stereogum named him their "band to watch" in July 2013, calling his music "addicting and fun." Pitchfork praised the release of "Mr. Wonderful," the lead track off the 2014 EP Gin City, which was hosted on the music blog Gorilla vs. Bear. In February, Gorilla vs. Bear also hosted the premiere of the track "Baby."In June 2014, Saint Pepsi went on tour with Painted Palms after signing to Carpark Records, whose roster includes artists such as Beach House, Cloud Nothings, Toro y Moi, and Memory Tapes.


== Hit Vibes ==
The 2013 album Hit Vibes was very well known around the vaporwave and future funk communities, and is highly praised by critics. This would be Saint Pepsi's last full-length album, before changing his alias to Skylar Spence, after some legal trouble involving the name. However, Spence would use the alias again when releasing Mannequin Challenge in 2019. Hit Vibes has received acclaim from music critics for its seamless edits and catchy grooves alongside cleverly entwining dialogue from Woody Allen's musical comedy Everyone Says I Love You.

== Late Night Delight ==
Also from 2013 (this time, collaborating with fellow vaporwave artist Luxury Elite), Late Night Delight features Enjoy Yourself   which samples Michael Jackson's title track from his 1979 album Off the Wall. The song used, for its music video, a McDonald's commercial  from the late 1980s featuring corporate mascot Mac Tonight.

Following a six year hiatus with the alias Saint Pepsi, in 2019 a surprise comeback featuring a new album was announced on August 27 and released the 30th of the same month.

== Style ==
Spence's musical style has been described as being in the categories of future funk, vaporwave, disco pop, futurepop, liquid disco, slow jam and gibber boogie, although he also borders between traditional music genres. He often incorporates unorthodox sounds in his music, using sources such as the soundtracks from games like Mario Kart 64. He also commonly samples pop songs (ex: Private Caller, which also appeared on the compilation album Portals Summer II, sampled Canadian artist Lustt's 1983 cover of Sylvia Robinson's 1973 track "Pillow Talk") The Fader calls his nonchalant approach to Top 40 hits "refreshing," and calls his music "restless and nostalgic and sonically curious." He is quoted as saying, "I’m drawn to tuneful melodies; complex chord structures; outlandish synths and drums; and I like to take pop a cappellas and see how I can warp the songs while keeping the melodies almost entirely intact [...] I want to make pop music for freaks, basically."
