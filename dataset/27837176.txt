Jules Timothy Weisberg (born January 1, 1943) is an American flutist, vocalist, and record producer.


== Career ==
In school he wanted to play drums, but instruments were chosen in order of the students' last names, and when Weisberg got his chance, his choice was bassoon or flute. He chose the latter because it was easier to carry and seemed easier to learn. He was a fan of soul music, which had been using the flute in the 1960s. He studied classical music before playing soul, jazz, and pop. His first experience recording was on The Monkees' album The Monkees Present in 1969.While working as a studio musician, his debut album was released with a version of "Nights in White Satin" by The Moody Blues. In 1972 he recorded with The Carpenters and two years later appeared on the television programs The Midnight Special and Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. His song "A Hard Way to Go" appeared in Woody Allen's movie Annie Hall. He had a hit song, "The Power of Gold", on Twin Sons of Different Mothers (1978), an album recorded with Dan Fogelberg. They collaborated again in 1995 on No Resemblance Whatsoever. Weisberg sued Fogelberg in 1997 for alleged breach of contract and fraud.Weisberg has performed with David Benoit, Dave Mason, David Arkenstone, and Eddie Rabbitt.
