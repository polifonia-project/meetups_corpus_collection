Peter Ritzen studied piano and chamber music at the Royal Conservatory of his native city Ghent. His teachers were Louis Pas and François Glorieux.

As a concert pianist, Ritzen has played throughout Europe, Asia and the US. He cooperated as a soloist with many well known orchestras and ensembles. He is an acclaimed interpreter of Franz Liszt & Theodor Leschetizky. His contact with the Chinese Culture resulted in a whole repertoire of own China related compositions. As a result of free classical improvising in concerts on the piano, he transcribed numerous Chinese folk songs, award-winning movie themes and Viennese waltzes. Ritzen is a composer of massive works with many performers (+400). His transcendental symphony 'Heavenly Peace', world premiered in 2005 is a typical work in this magnitude. Ritzen is a performing artist for Naxos Records.

The inaugural concert was held at the Haydnsaal of Schloss Esterházy in Eisenstadt, Austria under Ritzen's baton. The world-famous cellist Christine Walevska was one of the featured soloists. The festival intends to combine Far East Musicians with European Music traditions.
Since 2016, Ritzen has been music director of the Vienna-based New Cosmos Philharmonic. The orchestra is featured as the festival orchestra at the annual New Cosmos International Music Festival in Vienna.
In 2017, Ritzen conducted at the Golden Hall of Musikverein in Vienna, the New Cosmos Philharmonic, the world premiere of his Symphonic Poem, 'Die Wildrose'. A work for grand orchestra, organ, chorus and soloists. The libretto is based on Flemish translated poems (to German language) by Anton van Wilderode (1918-1998).
