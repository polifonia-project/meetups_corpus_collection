== Controversies ==


=== "E Dehun" music video ===
Istrefi received criticism from the Serbian Orthodox Church after the release of the music video for her third single "E Dehun". The video depicted a semi-nude woman dancing around the Church of Christ the Saviour in Pristina. The Serbian Orthodox Church called her actions "demonic" and "blasphemous".

=== "BonBon" lyrics ===
When her biggest song to date "BonBon" was originally released through NES√ãR, the lyrics contained the ethnic slur nigga. As the song's popularity increased internationally, audiences began to notice the use of the term which caused criticism. After the video was re-uploaded to Ultra Music's YouTube channel, the word was cut out.
Istrefi later apologized via social media for using the word: My apologies for the ignorance in using the N word. #noracism #weareone üåè In Kosova there r no black people so we call each other that way in terms of "bro". Thats why we should always think BIG.
