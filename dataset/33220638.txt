David Weiss (born October 21, 1964) is a jazz trumpeter and the founder of The New Jazz Composers Octet.


== Career ==
He studied music at North Texas State University, graduating in 1986. Returning to New York, he performed with Jaki Byard, Frank Foster, and Jimmy Heath. He continued his studies with trumpeters Tommy Turrentine and Bill Hardman, as well as attending Barry Harris's jazz classes. Eventually leading an "after hours" session for Harris, he performed with such musicians as Stephen Scott, Winard Harper, Leon Parker, Sam Newsome, Justin Robinson, Rodney Kendrick, Roy Hargrove, Clifford Jordan, Mulgrew Miller, Jeff Watts, Terence Blanchard, Benny Green, and Billy Hart.
In 1990, Weiss started a band with tenor saxophonist Craig Handy. The rest of the band rotated: Benny Green, Stephen Scott, or Dave Kikoski on piano, Christian McBride on bass, and Billy Hart or Jeff Watts on drums. Weiss assisted Handy with the music of The Cosby Mysteries, including arranging the title theme. From there, he began arranging for such artists as Abbey Lincoln, Freddie Hubbard, and Rodney Kendrick, Alto Legacy with Phil Woods, Vincent Herring, and Antonio Hart. He arranged an album called Haunted Melodies in tribute to Rahsaan Roland Kirk, as well as tribute concerts at Birdland for Freddie Hubbard, Booker Little, and Lee Morgan.
Recognizing a dearth of new jazz composition, Weiss founded The New Jazz Composers Octet, which Ben Ratliff of The New York Times immediately hailed as "the sound of the new jazz mainstream." Weiss's compositions on the Octet's second album won him grants from Chamber Music America and Doris Duke Jazz Ensembles Project: New Works Creation and Presentation.
Weiss released his first album as leader, Breathing Room, in 2002, featuring Craig Handy, Xavier Davis, Dwayne Burno, Marcus Strickland, and E. J. Strickland, some of whom are involved with the Octet. It received four star ratings from DownBeat magazine, Jazzwise, and 52nd Street.
