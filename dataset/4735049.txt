== Musical career ==
In 2000, Heatherly was signed to Mercury Nashville Records as a recording artist. His debut single was a cover version of The Statler Brothers' 1965 debut single "Flowers on the Wall". Heatherly's rendition was a Top Ten hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart, peaking at #6 in mid-2000.
The song served as the first single from his debut album. Entitled Swimming in Champagne, the album was co-produced by Keith Stegall. Due to a restructuring of Mercury Nashville's parent company, Swimming in Champagne received minimal promotion; its second and third singles peaked at #46 and at #32 on the chart. Heatherly had also recorded a second album for Mercury, but it was not released, and Heatherly was dropped from the label by 2002.A month after parting ways with Mercury, Heatherly signed to DreamWorks Records' Nashville division. His third album, to be titled Sometimes It's Just Your Time, was to have been released in late 2002. Its lead-off single ("The Last Man Committed") entered the country music chart; although promotional advance copies of the album, Sometimes It's Just Your Time, had been issued, it was ultimately unreleased as well.Three years after his departure from DreamWorks's roster, he founded a personal label named NashVegas Records, with Koch Records serving as distributor. His fourth album overall (but only the second to be released), The Lower East Side of Life, was issued in 2005, though no singles were released from it.After The Lower East Side of Life, Heatherly continued to tour, in addition to manufacturing custom-made guitar straps. Through the help of songwriter and producer Carson Chamberlain, Heatherly recorded a song called "Unforgettable", which appeared in an episode of Grey's Anatomy. He has also recorded another album, 2 High 2 Cry, released in 2009. A second self-released album, Painkillers, followed in 2010.
