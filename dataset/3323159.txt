During Gustaf's childhood and teenage years football played a big role. As other members of Mando Diao, he was a fan of FC Brage (Borlänge), a local football club with strong roots in the working class.
After football rock music was the second most important topic at school. Gustaf had a soft spot for the music of the 1960s, especially The Beatles. New bands like Nirvana (band) were added to his favourites and since 1995 Britpop bands like Oasis (band) and Blur (band).


== Musical career ==


=== Mando Diao ===

Gustaf Norén, was one of the two frontmen (vocals, guitar) of the Swedish rock band Mando Diao. In 1996, Gustaf met Björn Dixgård at a party. A short time later Björn invited Gustaf to join his band; they became the two frontmen of Butler, the band Björn Dixgård had founded together with Daniel Haglund, the future keyboarder of Mando Diao. Gustaf's father Jan for some time was part of the band too. In 1997, the name Butler was changed to Mando Jao. Allegedly Björn had a dream where a man appeared and shouted at him, telling him to name his band Mando Jao. Björn obeyed. Gustaf left the band in 1998 after he moved to Falun and had become alienated from his friends; however, after a short time he returned.In 1999, the name was changed to Mando Diao as the band was sure it would offer a better English pronunciation. Band members at this time were Björn Dixgård, Gustaf Norén, Daniel Haglund, and Carl-Johan Fogelklou. During the same year Samuel Giers joined the band as the drummer. Daniel Haglund left the band in 2004 and was replaced by Mats Björke.
Touring bars and small locations all over Sweden were soon followed by performances in Central Europe; the US and Japan. Each of Mando Diao's album releases became more successful; today they are one of Sweden's most well known bands.
In 2008, Gustaf Norén and Björn Dixgård joined the artist collective Caligola; in 2012, the album Back To Earth was the first release of the music project.
Mando Diao's biggest success in their home country Sweden was achieved with the sixth studio album Infruset where ten poems of the Swedish poet Gustaf Fröding were set to music in 2012.

The screenplay by Fia-Stina Sandlund and Josefine Adolfsson is a contemporary take on August Strindberg's play Miss Julie (Fröken Julie) from 1888. The plot is set in Brooklyn and Gustaf Norén and Shima Niavarani play their own fictionalized personalities. What begins as a professional meeting between two politically conscious young artists develops into a game of power where their inner selves are exposed. With feminism and anti-racism as weapons, She's Wild Again Tonight examines the modern gender roles in the young urban conscious sphere and blurs the boundaries between reality, drama, and fiction.
