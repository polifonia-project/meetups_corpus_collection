Alice DiMicele is a folk musician and environmental singer/songwriter from Ashland, Oregon.


== Early life ==
She was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1965, to a pianist mother and a school teacher father. Alice grew up playing the recorder, flute, and guitar. At 15 she was the lead singer of a local rock/fusion band called White Rabbit, which then changed its name to Eon Ocean. She also sang jazz harmonies in high school and was in the school band. After attending the state University of New York, she moved to southern Oregon at the age of 21.


== Career ==
In 1988 she recorded her first album, on her own label, Alice Otter Music. It contained 9 songs, including "Celebrate the Rain", a song she wrote when she was 9 years old, and one of her most requested tracks to this day, "Wise Old Woman". DiMicele has toured extensively over the course of a career that has spanned nearly 20 years playing many festivals, benefits, and venues. She has released 10 albums on her own label and is a part of 3 compilations.
Many of the themes of her recordings reflect her environmental, LGBT, and anti-war interests. She has shared the stage with Bonnie Raitt, Joan Baez, Arlo Guthrie, Janis Ian, David Grisman, Steve Winwood, Michael Franti, Rob Kohler, and many more.
She has provided music on many benefit tours such as the Ancient Forest Rescue Expedition, traveling the country with an 800-year-old log to show America what was happening to our ancient forests and at the first Earth First! Roadshow in England and Scotland.
When Earth First! activists Judi Bari & Darryl Cherney were bombed, DiMicele, along with friends Dana Lyons and Citizen's Band, toured the Northwest to raise money for them. For two years, Alice also raised money at every one of her solo shows to support Bari (who could not work due to her injuries) and her two young children.
Her song "Chinook Blues" on her Alice Live album provided the backdrop to the video Source to Sea: the Columbia River Swim about the declining native salmon population in the Pacific Northwest ecosystem.
