Pervis Jackson (May 17, 1938 â€“ August 18, 2008) was an American R&B singer, noted as the bass singer for The Spinners, and was one of the group's original members as well as their spokesman. His deep timbered voice and calm swagger garnered him a reputation around town and the industry.
Jackson was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, but moved with his family at a very young age to the city of Detroit. Jackson was perhaps best known for his line of "12:45" from the group's Billboard charting Top 10 hit "Games People Play", released in 1975.
Jackson was still a part of The Spinners up to his death from brain and liver cancer at the age of 70, in Detroit, Michigan, on August 18, 2008.
