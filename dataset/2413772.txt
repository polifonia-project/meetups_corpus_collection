== Career ==
Many better-known musicians (Dinah Washington, Ella Fitzgerald, Oscar Peterson, Nat Adderley, Stan Getz, Charlie Byrd and others), recognizing Betts's talent, invited him to perform with them professionally. Early in Betts's career he joined Earl Bostic's R&B band from April 1949- August 1951. Accompanied Dinah Washington/December 1951 to October 1956. Became member of Charlie Byrd's Trio in 1957, and in 1962, together with Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd, he was instrumental in introducing the bossa nova style to American audiences via their Jazz Samba recording. Worked with Bobby Timmons and recorded an album in 1964; began accompanying Ella Fitzgerald in October of that year. In the mid-1960s, Betts began a nearly quarter-century relationship as a bassist with Ella Fitzgerald. Left Ella Fitzgerald and worked with Roberta Flack, Joe Williams, Johnny Hartman, Kenny Burrell, Herbie Mann, Billy Eckstine, and Chris Connor.  Rejoined Ella in December 1971 and remained with her until her retirement.
