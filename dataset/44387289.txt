Jason Roeder is the drummer of the Oakland-based metal bands Neurosis and Sleep.
He played in the hardcore punk band Violent Coercion with Scott Kelly and Dave Edwardson before the trio formed Neurosis in 1985. The group also formed experimental/noise project Tribes of Neurot, Neurosis' alter ego. In 2010, Roeder replaced the retiring drummer of the stoner metal band Sleep.


== Equipment ==
Roeder plays on kits with only a single rack and floor tom since he was 12 years old since the basic set-up forces more creativity. He custom builds his own snare drums while using DW hardware and Paiste cymbals.
