== Early life ==
Kerrie Roberts grew up as a daughter to a pastor and a church choir director. It is because of this that Roberts spent a lot of time in the church during her childhood.  Roberts began performing music at the age of 5, singing in her mom's church choir. According to her YouTube autobiography, she was so small that she had to stand on a milk crate in order for the congregation to see her. This experience eventually led to her playing piano and leading worship music in the church. Roberts' music revolved solely around her parents' church until high school, at which point she began writing her own songs. This writing continued while she attended college at the University of Miami; she graduated with a degree in studio music and jazz vocal.
