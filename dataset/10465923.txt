Dominic Aitchison (born 11 October 1976) is a Scottish bassist and songwriter. He is best known as the bassist and founding member of post-rock band Mogwai. Aside from Mogwai, he also played bass guitar in Crippled Black Phoenix and Stage Blood.
Aitchison studied Graphic Design at The Glasgow College of Building and Printing, which is now part of the City of Glasgow College.
He founded Mogwai with Stuart Braithwaite, along with drummer Martin Bulloch. He was the main songwriter of the band at the begin of their career (along with Braithwaite), before the "new" member Barry Burns became it.
He's a very versatile bass player, often playing with plectrum because of the sound of his band, but he's very able to play with fingers too.
