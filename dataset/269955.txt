David Michael Farrell, better known by his stage name Phoenix (born February 8, 1977) is an American musician, best known as the bassist and backing vocalist of the rock band Linkin Park. He was also a member of Snax, a pop punk band.


== Early life ==
Farrell was taught how to play guitar by his mother when he was in high school. He grew up in Plymouth but later moved to Mission Viejo, California at the age of 5.


=== Tasty Snax ===
While attending high school, Farrell joined a Christian ska punk band named Tasty Snax, who would later rename themselves to The Snax. Phoenix transitioned from the electric guitar to bass to accommodate The Snax. The band included Farrell's longtime college friend Mark Fiore, who was also associated in making of various video albums for Linkin Park. The band recorded two studio albums and one compilation album, signed to Screaming Giant Records. Farrell left the band in 2000.


=== Linkin Park ===

Farrell joined Xero, the earliest incarnation of Linkin Park, after meeting Brad Delson at UCLA. He contributed to the band's self-titled demo tape in 1997, but left the project to tour with Tasty Snax. Farrell's void was temporally filled by Delson, Ian Hornbeck and Scott Koziol, who all contributed to Hybrid Theory, Linkin Park's debut album. Farrell returned to Linkin Park in 2000 after a year-long absence. Linkin Park went on a hiatus for nearly three years after Chester Bennington died in 2017. In 2020, Farrell revealed that Linkin Park is working on new music.
