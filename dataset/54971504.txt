His other grandfather promised to buy Shelor a real banjo if he learned to play two songs. Sam met the challenge, his grandfather bought him a Ventura banjo, and by age 10 Shelor was performing in local bands.Shelor patterned his playing and career after J. D. Crowe, Earl Scruggs, and Sonny Osborne of The Osborne Brothers.Shelor became a full time professional musician when he joined Richmond, Virginia-based The Heights Of Grass at age 19.
