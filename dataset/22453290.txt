Although Green was highly praised for his performance, with comments coming from Piers Morgan stating, "Everything about you says you're a young star," to Holden's, "You're such a pro. And you have a wonderful wonderful voice", his non-standard song choice was unanimously criticized. Simon Cowell in particular commented that the song was "terrible", but went on to say that he would rate Green's performance as a 10, and his song choice as a 2.Streetdancer George Sampson finished first according to the public vote, leaving the judges to choose between Green and martial arts duo Strike.
