Erika María Ender Simoes (born 21 December 1974) is a Panamanian singer, songwriter and actress. In addition to her singing career, Ender is considered one of the most important and prolific composers in the Latin music market today. Along with Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, she is the co-writer of the worldwide hit "Despacito".


== Early life ==
Ender was born in Panama City, the daughter of a Panamanian-American father and Brazilian mother. Due to her roots, she grew up in a multicultural and trilingual home, so she writes, sings and composes songs in Spanish, Portuguese and English. Ender currently resides in Miami, Florida.


== Career ==
As a singer, Ender has released five CDs—three of them international—in a variety of genres such as pop, rock, tropical and regional Mexican. Her musical versatility has made it possible for stars such as Daddy Yankee, Chayanne, Gloria Trevi, Ednita Nazario, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Ana Bárbara, Víctor Manuelle, Los Horóscopos de Durango, Milly Quezada, Elvis Crespo, Giselle, Melina León, Ha*Ash, Prince Royce, Akon, José Luis Rodríguez "El Puma", Luis Enrique, Luis Fonsi, Malú, Jaci Velásquez, and Azúcar Moreno, to interpret their songs.
Her successful career as a songwriter includes the albums Abreme La Puerta, Cueste Lo Que Cueste and En Concierto. Topping the Billboards with singles like "Cheque Al Portador" (2004), "Abreme La Puerta" (2004), "Luna Nueva" (2006), "Quien Sale... No Entra" (2006), "Masoquista" (2009), "Cadê?" and "Sigo Caminando", among others, have led to her performing in multiple countries.
A great accomplishment as a composer was when in 2004 her theme "Cheque Al Portador" allowed Ender to qualify at the International Song Festival of Viña del Mar, where she represented her native Panama for the first time in the 45 years since the event began in 1960.
In January 2017, "Despacito", featuring Daddy Yankee and Luis Fonsi and co-written by Ender, was promoted and released. The music video reached 6 billion views, with the song becoming number 1 in nearly every Latin Billboard chart.
