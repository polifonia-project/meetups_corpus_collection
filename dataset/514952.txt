Warren Anderson Mathis (born March 6, 1977), better known by his stage name Bubba Sparxxx, is an American rapper from Georgia. His singles include "Deliverance", "Ugly" (both featuring Timbaland), and "Ms. New Booty" (featuring Ying Yang Twins and Mr. Collipark), the latter of which peaked at number 7 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.


== Early life ==
Mathis grew up in a rural area near LaGrange, Georgia. He is of French descent. His father was a school bus driver, and his mother was a grocery store cashier. His closest neighbor, who lived half a mile away, introduced him to rap music through mixtapes mailed from New York City. The music of 2 Live Crew was his introduction to hip hop; he began listening to West Coast gangsta rap such as N.W.A and Too Short and the Atlanta duo Outkast. With rapping as a hobby, he was a tight end and linebacker for his high school's football team and earned All-Region honors in his senior year. Steve Herndon, a former offensive lineman for the NFL's Atlanta Falcons and Denver Broncos, played football with him during high school, according to an interview with Down-South.com. In 2007, he moved to Tampa, Florida.

=== Beginnings and early years (1996–1998) ===
In 1996, he moved to Athens, Georgia, where he met industry veteran Bobby Stamps. Stamps noticed him rapping after a University of Georgia football game and later introduced him to Atlanta producer Shannon Houchins.

For two years, Houchins and Stamps worked together to produce Sparxxx's first commercial CD release, Dark Days, Bright Nights, which released in 2001.

Sparxxx signed to Interscope and began working with record producers Timbaland, Organized Noize as well as continuing to work with Shannon Houchins. The major-label reissue of Dark Days, Bright Nights, released via Timbaland's Beat Club Records imprint and which now included five collaborations with Timbaland and two with Organized Noise, debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200.
