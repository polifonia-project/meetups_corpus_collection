To mirror the influence of their second studio album I Love You Dude, the band rebuilt their live show and incorporated more modular synthesisers, which they would play live—this involved adding a live drummer. As a live act, they shared the stage with many acts including Queens of the Stone Age, DJ Shadow, Moderat, and Justice. At the same time as DJs, they developed a following with house and techno sets.
Digitalism have made appearances at festivals such as Coachella, Lollapalooza, South by Southwest, Rhythm and Vines, Electric Picnic, and Ultra Music Festival.
