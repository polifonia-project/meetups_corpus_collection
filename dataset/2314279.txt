She has released three solo albums, as well as a DJ mix album for the DJ-Kicks series, and featured on "Three" and "Sly", two songs on Massive Attack's 1994 Protection album. She has worked with many other collaborators in the electronic music field, including Plaid, Alec Empire, and 4hero.  She signed to the Talkin' Loud label in 1996. In 1999 she set up her own record label, Early Records, upon leaving Talkinâ€™ Loud to release quirky pop anthems. According to Nicolette, Early Records' music policy is: "innovative pop music." Nicolette's 2005 album, Life Loves Us, was released through the label. One single and a 6-track EP were released from the album in the following year.
In 2007, Nicolette's "No Government" was re-released and remixed by DJ Tocadisco and Makossa & Megablast. In 2008, Nicolette contributed vocals to John Tejada's album Where, she sings and co-wrote the track "Desire". She released a single called "Love" with DJ Cam in March 2010. More recently she worked with Samuel Yirga on his album and released an EP. She also acted in Solveig Anspach's film "Queen of Montreuil". Her latest album "The Infinitive" is coming out in 2022.
