Howlin Rain is an American rock band based in Oakland, California, formed in 2004 by guitarist/singer Ethan Miller. Their most recent album The Dharma Wheel was released in 2021. Their sound has been described as "classically soulful" and "Unapologetically influenced by the strong but easygoing grooves of West Coast 1970s rock".


== History ==
Ethan Miller formed Howlin Rain in 2004 when he was still a member of Comets on Fire, as an outlet for his songwriting interests and the influence of life in the Lost Coast area of Northern California. The first incarnation of the band also included bassist Ian Gradek and drummer John Moloney (who later joined Sunburned Hand of the Man). The final Comets on Fire album was released in 2006, after which Miller dedicated himself to Howlin Rain full-time. The group has since featured a revolving line-up with Miller as the only constant member.
The self-titled album Howlin Rain was released in 2006, establishing a "psychedelic country/garage rock" sound, after which the band toured as the opening act for Queens of the Stone Age. In 2007, the band signed with Rick Rubin to American Recordings. Their second album Magnificent Fiend, featuring an expanded line-up, was released in 2008. This album was noted for featuring jam band elements, and was described as a "combination of psychedelia, blues, funk and classic 1970s arena rock." The EPs Wild Life and The Good Life followed.Howlin Rain performed at All Tomorrow's Parties in England in 2010. Their third full-length album The Russian Wilds was released in 2012, featuring further experiments in blues rock and 1970s album-oriented rock. This was the band's final album with American Recordings, and Miller reformed the line-up once again. Miller then conceived an interconnected trilogy of albums, and the first installment Mansion Songs was released in 2015.Miller formed his own label, Silver Current Records, which issued The Alligator Bride in 2018. That album introduced hard rock and R&B elements to the group's sound. The third album in the planned trilogy, The Dharma Wheel, was released in 2021.
