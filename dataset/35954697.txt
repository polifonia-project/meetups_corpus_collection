== Biography ==
Weiss began playing music as a teenager in their hometown of Flowery Branch, Georgia. Inspired by the emotional tumult of young relationships, they began writing songs, adopting a DIY ethic that would stay with them throughout their career. Weiss released their first EP, An Eight-Song Tribute to Feeling Bad and Feeling Better, in 2007, while attending the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. They followed it up with a full-length concert album, Live at Sidewalk NYC, a year later.
In late 2009, Weiss turned to the newly launched Kickstarter crowd-funding platform to try raising the money for their first studio LP, ...Was Right All Along. Their campaign allowed them to reach their funding goal within the first day and triple it just days later. The Kickstarter success led to some high-exposure press, with The New York Times and Wired magazine essentially labeling them as a sort of poster child for the new era of Internet promotion. Weiss turned the attention into countless tours, interviews, and a panelist slot at the industry's SXSW conference in Austin alongside Kickstarter founder Yancey Strickler.In 2011, Weiss recorded their second studio album, Say What You Mean, as well as a companion acoustic record called Sideways Sessions in Brooklyn, New York. Both albums were released on No Sleep Records in 2013. The label released an EP titled Remember When the following year.
In May 2015, Weiss signed with SideOneDummy Records and announced plans to release a third studio album later that year. New Love was released on October 2, 2015, produced by Forrest Kline of electro-pop band Hellogoodbye and Bradley Hale of indie rock band Now, Now.In 2017, shortly after the release of their single "Runaway," Weiss came out as non-binary and began assuming "they/them" pronouns. They discussed the transition on the podcast Queery, hosted by comedian Cameron Esposito, for which Weiss also provides the theme music with their song "Who We Are."
