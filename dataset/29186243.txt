Miroslava Johnová was born in Náchod. She studied voice with Rosa Papier at the Academy of Music in Vienna, and in 1915 moved to Prague to study piano with Václav Štěpán and composition with Vítězslav Novák. In 1919, she married businessman Rudolf Vorel (whose name she adopted in its Czech form, Vorlová), and spent fifteen years in working in his business.
In 1933, she returned to composing and produced a string quartet, then continued her composition studies the next year with Jaroslav Řídký and František Maxián at the Prague Conservatory of Music. In 1945, Vorlová witnessed her husband's execution by an SS commando. She died in Prague, aged 79.
