Joshua Neil Farro (born September 29, 1987) is an American musician and songwriter. He is best known as the former lead guitarist and backing vocalist for the rock band Paramore. Farro is currently pursuing his solo career as the lead vocalist and guitarist of his self-named band, Farro. His debut solo album, Walkways, was released independently to digital retailers on February 5, 2016.


== Early life ==
Farro was born in Voorhees Township, New Jersey on September 29, 1987. He is the second-oldest of his four other siblings, including Paramore drummer Zac Farro. He is a self-taught guitarist, and began playing when he was 13 years old. His family later moved to Franklin, Tennessee.


== Career ==


=== Paramore (2004–2010) ===
Along with his younger brother Zac, Farro was a founding member of Paramore, serving as the band's lead guitarist and backing vocalist from 2004 until his exit in late 2010. Farro also co-wrote almost every track on Paramore's first three albums with Hayley Williams and occasionally Taylor York.


==== Departure and blog controversy ====
On December 21, 2010, a blog appeared online claiming to be an official exit statement from the Farro brothers. The blog entry refuted statements made by Paramore's official website regarding the brothers' departure and was heavily critical of Hayley Williams, her family, Atlantic Records, and Fueled by Ramen. Farro appeared in a video on YouTube claiming that the blog was genuine. The video was quickly removed for reported violations, but Farro re-uploaded it a few days later. Farro, a Christian, cited his beliefs as a reason for departing Paramore.In 2020, Farro made a post on his Facebook page comparing pedophilia and homosexuality, leading Williams to claim that his alleged homophobia was a cause for his departure from the group.


=== Novel American (2011–2014) ===

On February 2, 2011, Farro announced he had established a Twitter account for his new band, Novel American. The band included high school friends Van Beasley, Tyler Ward, and Ryan Clark, each formerly of the band Cecil Adora. Unlike in Paramore, Farro relegated himself to guitar in the new project, saying "I never wanted to sing. My voice — and this is not false humility — is just not that good."
On February 22, 2011, the band announced Farro's brother Zac would replace Tyler Ward on drums. However, on May 23, 2014, Farro stated that he had scrapped the project entirely, primarily due to the lack of a suitable vocalist.


=== Farro (2014–present) ===
In May 2014, Farro announced on Twitter that he had scrapped his previous band, Novel American, because "nothing was going anywhere".  Later that year, he announced the name of his solo project, Farro. His debut single, "Color Rush", was released in November 2014, with a music video appearing on YouTube. Farro released his debut album, Walkways, independently on February 5, 2016. He also announced a mini tour to support the album throughout the year.
On May 19, 2017, he announced on Twitter that he is writing for his second album.
