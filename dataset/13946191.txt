Unbeknownst to the band these performances were being used by Myers as an audition to see whether they could cut it as potential clients. According to vocalist Shi Eubank, after the shows Myers had said, "Well, the reason I brought you out here is that I wanted to see if you'd sink or swim in front of a crowd like this ... and you guys are out here doing the breaststroke."
