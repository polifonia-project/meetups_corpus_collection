Nechemia "Chemy" Soibelman (born January 7, 1991; Brooklyn, New York) is an American drummer.

He is also a former member of the Israeli Jewish rock band Hamakor and the livetronica group G-Nome Project.


== Career ==


=== The Groggers ===

Soibelman became a founding member of The Groggers in 2010 when he, guitarist Ari Friedman, and bassist C.J. Glass were recruited by lead singer L.E. Doug Staiman to film a video for the song "Get", which Staiman had written. The video became a minor viral hit, and the band subsequently released their debut album, There's No 'I' in Cherem. Soibelman initially concealed his involvement with the band due to their controversial material, to the point of wearing a mask in promotional photos, before ultimately revealing his identity.


=== Hamakor and G-Nome Project ===

Following his time with the Groggers, Soibelman co-founded the Jerusalem-based livetronica band G-Nome Project in 2012 with guitarist Yakir Hyman, bassist Zechariah Reich, and keyboardist Eyal Salomon. Their debut single, "Onflict", was released in 2014.
That same year, he was announced as part of the new lineup of the Jewish rock band Hamakor, of which Hyman and Reich had previously been members. He performed on their song "Lift Me Up".


=== Blue Melody ===
In the winter of 2018, G-Nome Project announced that Soibelman had left the band and was being replaced by drummer Eli Schabes.  Shortly thereafter, the New York City-based wedding band Blue Melody announced that Soibelman was their new drummer. Also, Soibelman joined the band Zusha in the summer of 2018.


== Influences ==
Soibelman has named Bob Marley, The Police, Michael Jackson, and Yaakov Shwekey as his personal musical inspirations.
