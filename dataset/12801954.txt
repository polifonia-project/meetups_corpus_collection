Jason Costa auditioned for All That Remains in 2006 to replace former drummer Shannon Lucas. When asked if making the switch from Diecast to All That Remains was difficult, he said, "Nothing for me was a challenge except having to put some time into practicing blast beats, but those are pretty easy... no secret to learning that. Just a metronome and some endurance."
