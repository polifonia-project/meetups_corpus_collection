== Personal life ==

=== Hobbies ===
Lovato started training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, a martial art derived from jujutsu, in 2016. They are ranked as a blue belt as of 2019.


=== Sexuality, gender and relationships ===
For a few months, Lovato dated singer Trace Cyrus in 2009. Lovato briefly dated their Camp Rock co-star Joe Jonas in 2010. Lovato then had an on-again, off-again relationship with actor Wilmer Valderrama; they first began dating in August 2010 and ended their relationship in June 2016. Lovato later dated UFC athlete Guilherme "Bomba" Vasconcelos from January to July 2017. In late 2018, Lovato briefly dated designer Henry Levy until March 2019. They dated model Austin Wilson for a few months until late 2019. On July 23, 2020, Lovato announced their engagement to actor Max Ehrich. They had begun dating four months prior, but eventually called off the engagement that September.Lovato describes their sexuality as fluid, and has said they are open to finding love with someone of any gender. In July 2020, they labeled themself queer in a social media statement mourning the death of their Glee co-star Naya Rivera. In March 2021, Lovato came out as pansexual and sexually fluid, stating in an interview, "I've always known I was hella queer, but I have fully embraced it." In the same interview, they called themself "just too queer" to date men at the time. They expressed that they feel proud of belonging to what they called the "alphabet mafia", referring to the LGBT community.On May 19, 2021, Lovato publicly came out as non-binary and announced the decision to change their gender pronouns to they/them, stating that "this has come after a lot of healing and self-reflective work. I'm still learning and coming into myself; I don't claim to be an expert or a spokesperson. Sharing this with you now opens another level of vulnerability for me." They had previously come out as non-binary to their family and friends towards the end of 2020.


=== Mental health and substance abuse ===
Lovato had suffered from bulimia nervosa, self-harm, and being bullied before their first stint in rehab at age 18. On November 1, 2010, Lovato withdrew from the Jonas Brothers: Live in Concert tour, entering a treatment facility for "physical and emotional issues". It was reported that they decided to enter treatment after punching backup dancer Alex Welch; their family and management team convinced them they needed help. Lovato said they took "100 percent, full responsibility" for the incident. On January 28, 2011, they completed in-patient treatment at Timberline Knolls and returned home. Lovato acknowledged that they had bulimia, had cut themself, and had been "self-medicating" with drugs and alcohol "like a lot of teens do to numb their pain". They added that they "basically had a nervous breakdown" and had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder during their treatment. They later admitted to having used cocaine several times a day and smuggled cocaine onto airplanes.

In April 2011, Lovato became a contributing editor for Seventeen magazine, penning an article that described their struggles. In March 2012, MTV aired a documentary, Demi Lovato: Stay Strong, about their rehab and recovery. They began work on their fourth studio album the following month. In January 2013, it was reported that Lovato had been living in a sober-living facility in Los Angeles for over a year because they felt it was the best way to avoid returning to their addiction and eating disorder. Lovato celebrated the five-year anniversary of their sobriety on March 15, 2017.In their 2017 YouTube documentary Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated, Lovato revealed that their treatment at Timberline Knolls had not been entirely successful, stating that they still struggled with alcoholism and a cocaine addiction in the year following their stint in the treatment center and further admitting that they were in fact under the influence of cocaine while being interviewed about their sobriety for Demi Lovato: Stay Strong. They stated, "I wasn't working my program. I wasn't ready to get sober. I was sneaking it on planes, sneaking it in bathrooms, sneaking it throughout the night. Nobody knew."Lovato also stated that their drug and alcohol addiction caused them to not only nearly overdose several times, but later began to impact their ability to perform live and promote their Unbroken album, referencing a 2012 performance on American Idol where they were severely hungover. After their management team had expressed their intentions to leave them, Lovato agreed to resume treatment and counseling for their addiction, leading to their move to a sober-living facility in Los Angeles with roommates and responsibilities to help them overcome their drug and alcohol problems. In March 2021, though stating they were done with hard drugs such as heroin, Lovato revealed they were not completely sober as they drank and smoked marijuana in moderation, something many of their friends openly disagreed with. They decided on moderation as they felt they were setting themself up for failure if they told themself they were never going to drink or smoke again. Lovato said it was because it had been drilled into them that "one drink was equivalent to a crack pipe." This changed the following December when they abandoned their "California sober ways" and declared themself "sober sober".In 2021, Lovato said they had initially accepted their bipolar diagnosis and shared this in 2011 because it explained their erratic behavior, but later came to believe it was inaccurate: "I was acting out when I was 18 for many reasons, but I know now from multiple different doctors that it was not because I was bipolar. I had to grow the fuck up." Lovato also stated that the diagnosis has been revised to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).


==== 2018 drug overdose ====
On June 21, 2018, Lovato released the single "Sober" in which they revealed they had relapsed after six years of sobriety. On July 24, 2018, they were rushed to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after emergency services were called to their home due to an opioid overdose. Lovato recalled, "The doctors told me that I had five to 10 minutes, like, if no one had found me, then I wouldn't be here." The singer was reported to be stable and recovering later in the day. They reportedly overdosed on oxycodone laced with fentanyl and were revived with naloxone. Lovato also had multiple health complications stemming from the overdose, including multiple strokes, a heart attack, and brain damage, the latter of which caused lasting vision problems. They were hospitalized for two weeks and subsequently entered an in-patient rehab facility.Lovato's drug overdose received widespread media coverage, leading to them becoming the most googled person of 2018, ahead of Meghan Markle, Brett Kavanaugh, Logan Paul, and other figures who had received extensive coverage throughout the year, due largely to the public interest surrounding the overdose. CBS News ranked the overdose the 29th biggest story of 2018.In December 2018, Lovato took to Twitter to dismiss rumors regarding their overdose and went on to thank their fans, writing, "If I feel like the world needs to know something, I will tell them MYSELF. All my fans need to know is I'm working hard on myself, I'm happy and clean and I'm SO grateful for their support." They added that some day they would "tell the world what exactly happened, why it happened and what my life is like today .. but until I'm ready to share that with people please stop prying and making up shit that you know nothing about. I still need space and time to heal."Lovato addressed the matter during a 2020 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, elaborating on how their worsened struggles with bulimia in 2018 contributed to their eventual drug overdose as they relapsed three months prior to the incident due to being extremely unhappy. The singer attributed these struggles to the extreme measures that their then-manager, Phil McIntyre, took to control the food they ingested. Lovato further explained that, along with the controlling nature of their management team, they did not provide them with the help they needed: "People checking what my orders at Starbucks were on my bank statements ... just little things like that ... it led me to being really unhappy and my bulimia got really bad and I asked for help and I didn't receive the help that I needed." Moreover, they recounted that their thought process the night they relapsed after six years of sobriety was as follows, "I'm six years sober and I'm miserable. I'm even more miserable than I was when I was drinking. Why am I sober?" When Lovato confronted their management about these thoughts, the latter responded with, "You're being very selfish, this would ruin things for not just you but for us as well." This made Lovato feel "completely abandoned" due to triggering their underlying abandonment issues with their birth father, and so they "drank ... that night".


==== Rape trauma ====
In 2021, Lovato revealed that they were raped at age 15 when they were an actor on the Disney Channel, and that the rapist was a co-star whom they had to continue seeing thereafter. The incident contributed to their bulimia and self-harm. They told someone about the incident, but the assaulter "never got in trouble for it. They never got taken out of the movie they were in." Lovato stated they did not acknowledge the act as rape at the time, because sexual activity was not normalized to them and they were part of the Disney crowd who wore purity rings and were waiting until marriage. However, they decided to share their experience because they believe that everyone should "speak their voice if they can and feel comfortable doing so". Lovato also stated they were raped during their 2018 drug overdose, realizing a month after the incident that they were not in a place to consent at that point.
