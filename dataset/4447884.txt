Donald Scott Smith (13 February 1955 â€“ 30 November 2000) was a Canadian musician and the bassist for Canadian rock band Loverboy. The band are best known for their hit singles "Working for the Weekend" and "Turn Me Loose", although their U.S. Top Ten hits were "Lovin' Every Minute of It" in 1985 and "This Could Be the Night" in 1986. The band won six Juno Awards in 1982 and has sold over 23 million records.


== Early life ==
Smith was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He originally studied guitar, and at the age of twelve moved to bass.


== Career ==
Smith was majoring in English at the University of Manitoba when he received a call from Loverboy guitarist Paul Dean in Vancouver inviting him to replace bassist Jim Clench in the newly-formed band.  In addition to playing bass for the band, Smith also co-wrote a few of the band's songs including the 1983 rock hit "Lucky Ones".
After Loverboy disbanded in 1988, Smith was part of the band Dangerous, along with Mike Reno and Brian MacLeod. He also worked as a late-night radio DJ at CFOX, albeit briefly. Loverboy got back together for a benefit concert in 1991, and then reunited in 1993 and continued touring through the 1990s. Smith said in an interview, "We're back because we like to rock and simply because promoters want to book us."


== Death ==
On 30 November 2000, Smith was sailing his boat, the 11-metre (36-foot) Sea Major, with two friends off the coast of San Francisco near the Golden Gate Bridge, when a large wave swept him overboard. Searches conducted by the Coast Guard and a private company hired by friends and family were unsuccessful. Smith was pronounced missing presumed dead, lost at sea.

Smith lived in Maple Ridge, British Columbia, and had two sons.
