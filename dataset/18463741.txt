Several of his works in Flash animation, along with multiple music videos and works of video art, have garnered large followings.


== Early life ==
David Firth was born in Doncaster, South Yorkshire in 1983.  He is the son of Graham and Rosemary Firth, both of whom are retired art teachers. Firth developed an interest in animation and filmmaking around the age of 13, and began producing online content around 1998, creating humorous websites and videos with help from friends, which were hosted on Geocities and Tripod. He briefly studied at the Hull campus of the University of Lincoln, but left without completing his degree  and is currently living in Leeds.


== Animation ==
Notable animation sequences from Firth include Salad Fingers, as well as the comedic Burnt Face Man series. A number of Firth's works have been featured by the BBC in the UK, and the BBC has hired Firth on several occasions. He also created a Flash animation series called Jerry Jackson in which a cartoon character claims to be a professional animator, even though the animation is intentionally poorly crafted. The character was based on Firth's perception of Internet users who would leave hateful comments on his videos.Firth's work often contains a large amount of dark imagery and tends to explore topics of a disturbing or surreal nature, such as depression and mental illness. Firth has stated that it is not his intention to upset or offend. Some of his work may be described as dark humour, while much of it is simply experimental, using many different styles.Firth has produced several animations for the BBC Comedy website, including his Musical Predictions 2009 and the Jerry Jackson series in 2009. In 2010, he created a new series for the BBC based on a character called Drillbithead.


== Filmography ==
One of Firth's most notable and productive projects has been MC Devvo aka Darren Devonshire. The Devvo series has been described as "a pill-munching, northern scallie that seemed kind of like a documentary.. " but "...far too harrowing and depressing for the main character to ever be real." Though commonly misattributed to Firth, Devvo is voiced by Christian Webb, who provides voices in Firth's cartoons and co-writes the Salad Fingers series. Firth instead features as the cameraman and occasionally appears alongside Webb as DJ Shady Piez. Firth has also produced short films for "Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe", televised on BBC Four. As of 2012, Firth has been working on his first animated feature film under working title The Meadow Man. In August 2019 Webb was fired from his job as a teacher at Thorne King Edwards Primary School in Doncaster when his previous YouTube notoriety came to light.Firth directed the music video for the Flying Lotus song "Ready Err Not", which premiered on Adult Swim on Halloween night 2014.Firth continues to post regularly on Fat-Pie.com and YouTube. On 30 March 2017, he created a Patreon page where fans can support his work.On 30 May 2017, Firth uploaded to his YouTube channel the short film Cream, produced by Flying Lotus for his production company and record label Brainfeeder, which had debuted at a London screening in November 2016. It is sometimes shown as an opening short to Kuso, a surreal horror-comedy-drama movie directed by Flying Lotus. Firth contributed animation, writing, and a voice role to the movie.
