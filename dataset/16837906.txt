Born in Detroit, Michigan growing up in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Randy was the fourth eldest of ten children born to Robert DeBarge, Sr. and Etterlene DeBarge. The DeBarge kids all sang in church and in high school, Randy joined the local band and learned how to play bass guitar from his elder brother Tommy. When Randy was seventeen, his older brothers Bobby and Tommy formed the Ohio-based funk/soul group Switch, later on signing with Motown in 1977.

After their 1981 debut, The DeBarges failed to garner any interest, the group decided to write and produce themselves with some help from Berry Gordy's niece Iris, the group released their sophomore release All This Love. After the modest success of the group's funk single, "Stop! Don't Tease Me", the second single, "I Like It" became their first hit reaching number two on the R&B charts and crossing over to number 31. It was co-led by Randy and El, whose higher vocals carried the rest of the group's releases from then on. Within a year, DeBarge was one of the hottest-selling R&B groups in the world scoring hits such as "All This Love", "Love Me in a Special Way", and "Rhythm of the Night". After both El and sister Bunny left for solo careers in 1986, Randy and his brothers recruited oldest brother Bobby to record the group's fifth release, Bad Boys, but due to the record's limited production on the independent Striped Horse label, the record tanked.  After a drug conviction befell Bobby and the group's younger brother Chico, the rest of DeBarge disbanded at the end of the eighties.
