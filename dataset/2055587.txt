== Career ==


=== Young Fresh Fellows ===

McCaughey started his career with the indie rock band Young Fresh Fellows. Beginning in January, 1980, he was also a writer for the Seattle monthly The Rocket.


=== R.E.M. ===
From 1994 until 2011, McCaughey worked with R.E.M. both on stage and in the studio. “When R.E.M. came to Seattle to work on Automatic for the People, Peter [Buck] called me up. He probably didn’t know anybody else in town. We’d go out to eat or have drinks pretty regularly while he was here. And then he ended up moving out here. Once he was here, we started playing together a lot, doing all The Minus 5 stuff." It was McCaughey who introduced Buck to his future wife, Stephanie. Buck invited McCaughey to join R.E.M. on their 1995 Monster tour, initially as a second guitarist. “[Peter] said, ‘I wouldn’t ask you if the Fellows were playing a lot.' But the Fellows were not really doing anything; we’d kind of brought it down to a crawl. I told him, ‘Sure, I’d like to try.’ I had to audition because I didn't know the rest of the guys as well as Peter.”McCaughey remained with R.E.M. in various capacities until the band's dissolution. He contributed to the studio albums New Adventures in Hi-Fi, Up, Reveal, Around the Sun, Accelerate and Collapse into Now. Additionally, he has received credits for his work on the live albums R.E.M. Live and Live at The Olympia album as well as their 2003 greatest hits collection, In Time. When working with R.E.M., McCaughey played guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, and sang backing vocals.

=== Moween ===
