In his last year of college, he began writing a weekly jazz column for The Washington Post. While writing for the Post, Gottlieb taught economics at the University of Maryland. After the Post determined that it would not pay a photographer to accompany Gottlieb's visits to jazz clubs, Gottlieb borrowed a press camera and began taking pictures for his column.Gottlieb was drafted into the Army Air Corps in 1943, and  served as a photography and a classifications officer. After World War II, Gottlieb moved to New York City to pursue a career in journalism.
