There he mixed many leading acts, including Cream, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Moby Grape, Ten Years After, BB King, Moody Blues, Buddy Guy, Grateful Dead, Hot Tuna, Procol Harum, The Chambers Brothers, Frank Zappa, and Janis Joplin. He began his recording career at Regent Sound Studios in Philadelphia, and later joined Regent's New York facility. There he expanded his knowledge, learning of studio and console design, disc cutting, studio recording, mixing and management.After two years at Regent he moved to the Hit Factory Recording Studios as chief recording engineer, where he engineered successful recordings by James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Carly Simon, Barry Manilow, and Dionne Warwick & The Spinners, among others. Hits he worked on included the album Barry Manilow II (US No. 9), and its US No. 1 single "Mandy"; Warwick & The Spinners' 1974 single "Then Came You" (US No. 1) (produced by Thom Bell), plus Carly Simon's Hotcakes album (US No. 3), and her single "Mockingbird" (US No. 5).
Maslin's career as a producer began at The Hit Factory, with the co-production of Bonnie Raitt's Streetlights album, he then moved to the Record Plant.


=== Bowie, Rollers and Air Supply ===
From August to December 1974 David Bowie recorded his new Philly soul-inspired album at Philadelphia's Sigma Sound and New York's Record Plant. Producer Tony Visconti returned to London to mix the recordings, but Bowie took an opportunity to collaborate with John Lennon. Bowie called Maslin and asked the young engineer to produce. In January 1975 at Electric Lady studios Maslin oversaw the recording of "Fame" with Lennon on guest vocals, as well as a cover of Lennon's own song "Across the Universe". These sessions completed the hit album Young Americans. This album reached UK No. 2, US No. 9, and the single "Fame" was US No. 1.
Bowie asked Maslin to produce his next album, Station to Station, in Los Angeles in 1975. The album was a critical and commercial success, charting at US No. 3 and UK No. 5, and included the singles “Golden Years” and “TVC15”.
Maslin rejoined the Hit Factory, and was next contacted by Clive Davis to produce two chart topper albums for the Bay City Rollers (including the 1977 hit single "You Made Me Believe in Magic" ), "Don't Cry Out Loud" a signature hit for Melissa Manchester in 1978, and an album for Eric Carmen in 1980. Davis then asked Maslin to take over production of the first Air Supply album for Arista Records, which achieved multi-platinum sales. He was called back to produce the following two multi-platinum albums for Air Supply, that were highlighted by five Top Five singles in a row "Even The Nights Are Better", "Every Woman In The World", "Here I Am", "Sweet Dreams", and "The One That You Love".

In 1983, Maslin opened his own studio, Image Recording Studios in Hollywood. Maslin reduced his workload as a producer and engineer and focussed on studio management and consulting.
