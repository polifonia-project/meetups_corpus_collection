== Musical career ==


=== AFI ===
Havok and his friends, Mark Stopholese and Vic Chalker, decided to start a band in high school, even though they did not own or play any instruments. Stopholese suggested that his friend, Adam Carson, might be able to fill the role of drummer because he owned a drum set. That band became AFI.
After high school, the band broke up when its members left for college. Havok attended UC Berkeley where he took on a double major in English and psychology. There, he began writing lyrics which would later appear on AFI's first two albums.
After gaining some popularity in their absence, AFI played a reunion show at the Phoenix Theater for several hundred fans. Following the positive reception, they decided to reunite and record an album. In 1995, the band's first album, Answer That and Stay Fashionable, was released on Wingnut Records and in 1996, their second album, Very Proud of Ya, was released on Nitro Records. In 1997, the band released their third full-length album, Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes.

However, Havok told an interviewer that he would never leave AFI as it was his own band.AFI continued to tour for a few years and released a few EPs along the way.
