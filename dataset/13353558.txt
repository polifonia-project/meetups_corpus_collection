He decided to do a promotional tour across the USA where his album and singles' success was limited, to garner interest. However, he went on 'cocaine-finding missions' in every city on the itinerary for the tour not having returned and missing subsequent engagements. It became clear that he had an issue with cocaine addiction after he eventually returned. He worked on what was to become his second album although its production ended prematurely after he took thousands of dollars in advance money. His second album was never completed causing Raynoma Gordy Singleton to absolve herself from further assistance in its production.
