Shortly after his first departure from Iron Butterfly in 1971, Dorman co-founded the band Captain Beyond with ex-Deep Purple lead vocalist Rod Evans, Dorman’s Butterfly band mate Larry Reinhardt, and  Bobby Caldwell. Dorman was raised in St. Louis, Missouri, and moved to San Diego in the 1960s. He began playing bass guitar in his teens.  While recording In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, Dorman assisted Erik Brann with the arrangement of Brann's song "Termination," and was given a co-writing credit.
Dorman died of natural causes in his car in Laguna Niguel, California on December 21, 2012. He was the second member of the In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida lineup, preceded by Erik Brann and succeeded by Ron Bushy, to die.
