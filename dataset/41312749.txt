=== 2008–2013: Beginnings, FIFA videos and controversy ===

KSI registered his first account on YouTube under the username "JideJunior" in 2008 while in his early teens. He registered his current YouTube account on 24 July 2009 under the name KSIOlajideBT, where he uploaded gaming–commentary videos of the FIFA video game series from his bedroom at his parents' house in Watford. He dropped out of sixth form college to pursue his YouTube career once he was earning steady monthly revenue from his uploads. In an interview in 2014, he recounted asking his teacher whether he should drop-out. His teacher asked how much KSI was making from YouTube, to which KSI answered, "around £1,500 a month", which was more than his teacher earned. His parents initially disapproved, but later became supportive and featured in a number of his videos.KSI later uploaded more vlog-style content and played a variety of games and in 2012, the channel reached a million subscribers.KSI's rise to fame was not without controversy. He was widely criticised for his self-described 'rape-face', a recurring joke on his channel during 2012 and 2013, and was the centre of a controversy following third-party allegations of sexual harassment of female staff at a Eurogamer event in 2012, that went so far as accusing him of sexually assaulting a spokesmodel Brandy Brewer, despite her tweeting that she consented to the motorboat, writing, "it's called comedy……relax". As a result, Microsoft cut ties with KSI and he was banned from Eurogamer events. KSI subsequently apologised "for any offence the video of 15 months ago may have caused in the short time it was on his YouTube channel, references to it since and subsequently used by other people" and stated his desire to move on from the incident and "be judged on the great content and value he gives to brands and partners, without controversy."


=== 2013–present: Sidemen and expanding content ===
In October 2013, KSI signed with Maker Studios' sub-network, Polaris. Since 19 October 2013, KSI has been part of the British YouTube group known as the Sidemen.

Shortly thereafter, he released a number of diss track videos criticising members of his then-former group, to which most of the members responded back with their own. Later that month, KSI released a video in which he claimed that he was being deported from the United States for receiving an incorrect visa. In November 2017, KSI released a video discussing whether his supposed falling out with the Sidemen was real or fake, saying, "[the drama] wasn't entirely real but wasn't entirely fake either."In 2019, he was ranked second by The Sunday Times in its list of the top 100 UK influencers.In 2021, Sidemen launched a subscription service known as Side+. They also launched a restaurant chain known as Sides, and a vodka known as XIX Vodka.
