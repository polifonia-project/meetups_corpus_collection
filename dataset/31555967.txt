Brought up in what he has described as a "very, very secular" environment, Clare became a baal teshuva to Orthodox Judaism in the mid-2000s. As such, he does not perform, travel or work on Shabbat or on Jewish holidays. He has said that he lost one-record deal opportunity due to this observance, but has found other ways to continue his career successfully. Clare also keeps a strictly kosher diet, and maintains a schedule of Talmud study on tour. He lost an album deal with Island Records because he had to turn down a radio concert for BBC in observance of the Succoth holiday in October 2011.In 2006, before gaining critical success, Clare dated British singer Amy Winehouse, but the relationship lasted less than a year. They met while he was performing and working at a bar she frequented, the Hawley Arms in Camden, North London.
He lived in Golders Green, an area in northwest London, before moving to Jerusalem in late 2015 together with his family.
