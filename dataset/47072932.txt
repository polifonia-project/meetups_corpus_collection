After studying with him for a year, Stinnett suggested that he and Blum record an album together.In February 2014, Blum released his debut jazz album, Initiation, with his quartet, which features bassist Jim Stinnett, pianist Brad Smith and drummer Dom Moio. All About Jazz called Initiation a "stellar debut." In a review of Initiation, Downbeat Magazine compared Blum to "Kenny Burrell, Charlie Byrd, Jim Hall, Johnny Smith, Emily Remler...or Columbia-era George Benson," and called Blum "an articulate player who executes with clarity...[and] shows unusual maturity." In a review of Initiation, Vintage Guitar Magazine said, "Hope for jazz guitar's future abounds in this release by the 20-year-old Blum and his quartetâ€¦[it's] the perfect debut for a player who seems wise beyond his years."In June 2015, Blum was named the "Rising Star" guitarist in the 63rd Annual Critics Poll in Downbeat Magazine. That same month, Blum released his second album and vocal debut, Commitment, which features bassist Jim Stinnett, pianist Brad Smith, saxophonist Fred Haas and electric bassist Grant Stinnett.
