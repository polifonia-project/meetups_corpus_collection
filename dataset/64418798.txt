Chitwood grew up in a small town near Peoria, Illinois. As a child, Chitwood was heavily involved in the stage-theater world; both her parents ran theaters, and she spent much of her childhood around the stage, as well as her grandfather's farm. She performed in her first show at six months old.

Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which dealt with whether a business could refuse service to LGBT clientele due to religious belief. It was recorded live at the Green Mill. A reviewer for comedy website The Interrobang praised the album, saying that with "her chronic chainsmoker voice and a jawline that could take down an oak tree ... it’s clear that Whitney’s a force to reckon with in the comedy world."She appeared in a 2019 episode of the NBC TV series  Chicago P.D.She hosts the podcast Is This Us? with Chicago comic Carly Ballerini.
