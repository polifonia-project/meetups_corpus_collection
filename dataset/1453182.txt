In December 2020, he launched a function-focused menswear brand called "Applied Art Forms". When talking about it to GQ, he said: "I have long been interested in classic workwear and military clothes. At heart I’m a collector. Over time I realised there were still gaps in my wardrobe, because I wanted clothing that was suited to the way we live now, with every design element considered and honed into a perfect garment.”
