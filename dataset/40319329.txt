Ummet Ozcan (Turkish: Ümmet Özcan, IPA: [ymˈmet øzˈdʒan]; born 16 August 1982) is a Dutch DJ and record producer of Turkish heritage from Putten, Gelderland.


== Biography ==
His releases signed to Spinnin' Records are supported by DJs like Sander van Doorn, Armin van Buuren, Tiësto, Calvin Harris and Hardwell. Ozcan is also known for his softsynth and soundbank design for well established music software houses like Rob Papen (Albino, Predator) and for hardware units such as the Access Virus.His hits include "TimeWave Zero" and "Arcadia" on Doorn Records and "Shamballa" on Reset Records, all sublabels of Spinnin' Records. In his early years, Ozcan produced techno-influenced trance music for release under Reset Records. After nearly five years, Ummet's production shifted focus towards the electronic dance music movement.
In late 2012, he started performing big room house alongside Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and R3hab for release on the main Spinnin label. In recent years he dedicated himself to other sub-genres and gradually quitted big room house. He produced remixes for worldwide known artists such as Tiësto ("Wasted") and Axwell & Ingrosso ("More Than You Know"). Some of his most popular latest hits are "Sober" (feat. HYO) "The Hum", "Melody", "Wake Up The Sun", "Everything Changes" and "Higher".
