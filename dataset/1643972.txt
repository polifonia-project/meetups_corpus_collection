Eric Ivan Rosse is an American composer, songwriter, record producer, and mixer.
Rosse started playing piano at age 8, eventually studying orchestration and arranging with Joe Rotundi Sr., whose mentorship—along with influences of soul, rock, art pop and classical music—has laid the foundation upon which he continues to build.
After playing in numerous bands as a keyboard player and singer, he expanded on his career by scoring TV and commercials, then going on to produce Tori Amos' albums Little Earthquakes and Under the Pink.
Since then, he has been instrumental in projects as diverse as Sara Bareilles' album Little Voice, Maroon 5, Birdy, Gavin DeGraw, Andra Day, Mary Lambert, and Benny Cassette.
Rosse has also worked with Pablo Alborán and Vanesa Martin. He produced and composed Alborán's Terral, which received a Latin Grammy and Grammy nomination.
Rosse co-wrote with Steve Aoki and Louis Tomlinson to pen the latter's solo debut single. The song is certified Gold and Platinum in several countries including reaching #1 on the US Dance/Electronic Sales Singles Billboard chart.
Through creative insight and intense focus, Rosse manages to bring impact and powerful appeal to the music he composes and produces, helping to create a unique musical and emotional voice for each project.


== Life and career ==
Rosse was born in Chicago, Illinois and began studying music at a young age starting with piano lessons. Through his training with Joe Rotundi Sr., he came to score an award-winning short film at the age of 17, Day's Last Rainbow, which was directed by James Herring. His first professional recording gig was at The Sound Factory in Hollywood, California, in 1980. Rosse was hired there to play electric piano on various R&B recordings, and continued gigging with various bands and musicians around Los Angeles until 1989, when he co-founded EMBR Music with his brother, Michael Carey. They operated for five years under the name EMBR, producing music spots for well-known media entities such as Coca-Cola, TDK, Anacin, Sega, Asics, NY Aids Awareness, NBC and CBS.
In 1994, Rosse began to focus heavily on album production, setting up his studio in unusual locations such as Taos and Santa Fe, New Mexico (where he produced Tori Amos' records), as well as Air Studios in London, where he produced projects for EMI-UK and Sony Music.
From 2002–2003, Rosse began working as an A&R consultant for Capitol Records, working with such artists as Lisa Marie Presley.
Currently, Rosse resides in Los Angeles and continues to produce, compose, and mix.
