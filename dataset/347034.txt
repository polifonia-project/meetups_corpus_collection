"John Wesley Harding's Cabinet of Wonders", his series of variety shows, began in Spring 2009 in New York City at (Le) Poisson Rouge, before moving to City Winery, and has included appearances by Rosanne Cash, Graham Parker, Josh Ritter, Rick Moody, Colson Whitehead, Jonathan Ames, A.C.

Two of the tracks are co-written with The Fiery Furnaces' Eleanor Friedberger, and alternative versions also appear on her album Personal Record. Stace co-wrote all of the songs on Personal Record with Friedberger. Stace reveals the new album is autobiographical in nature, one of the reasons he chose not to release the new material under the moniker of John Wesley Harding. The self-reflective songs are also influenced by Stace's love of Seventies singer-songwriters, the softer sound a change he felt was a natural transition in his career.Stace's fourth novel, Wonderkid, was published in February 2014 by The Overlook Press. On 24 February 2017 Yep Roc Records released Wesley Stace’s John Wesley Harding, backed by The Jayhawks.
