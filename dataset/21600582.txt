Oede de la Couroierie (died 1294), also known as Eude de Carigas and Odo de Corigiaria, was a trouvère of Artois. He is documented beginning in 1270 as a clerk in the house of Count Robert II, who often sent him on diplomatic missions. He served Robert until his death. His will, made in June 1294, providing for both a mistress with her two children and his widow with her three. His will calls him both Odon de Paris and Odon de Saint-Germain. He was probably born in the Île-de-France, near Paris.
