On the radio show Ahn SeonYoung's Radio Is Good on May 19, Chu Ga Yeol said  "Among the hoobaes of Super Junior that I taught how to play the guitar, Sungmin is the one who learnt to play well right away. To see a hoobae like Sungmin’s improvement in guitar skill, I feel so proud and it's very rewarding." Sungmin had previously said to Chu "If there are chances, I want to play the guitar on stage with you."
