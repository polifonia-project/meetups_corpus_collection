== History ==
A resident of Fredon Township, New Jersey, he graduated from Pope John XXIII Regional High School in 2005; Warner Brothers had signed his band to a recording deal while he was still in high school.After opening for Yeasayer at New York City's Governors Island in summer 2010 and a residency at Brooklyn club Union Pool, the band attracted media and record label attention. That year, Delicate Steve signed to Luaka Bop, who released the "Butterfly" 7" single, backed with a cover of Fleetwood Mac's "Albatross" on the B-side.


=== Wondervisions (2011) ===
On January 25, 2011, Delicate Steve's debut album, Wondervisions, was released on Luaka Bop. The entirety of the album was recorded by Marion in his bedroom and quickly gained the attention of critics, becoming a "Critics' Choice" selection of The New York Times as well as being included on NPR's "Favorite Songs of 2011".For the release of Wondervisions, author Chuck Klosterman wrote a fictional biography of Delicate Steve. The bio was originally published anonymously and was mostly taken as fact by fans and press, but was exposed in a feature news story on NPR's All Things Considered.


=== Positive Force (2012) ===
In July 2012, Delicate Steve's sophomore record, Positive Force, was released on Luaka Bop. The album quickly received high praise, including an 84 from Filter, an 8.5 from Paste, a 7.6 in Pitchfork and a 7 from Spin.For promotion of Positive Force, a legitimate biography of the band was written by Michael Azerrad, author of Our Band Could Be Your Life.On September 3, 2014, the band issued a free digital sampler EP, titled Multiple Moods Sampler, via Bandcamp.


=== Live in Las Vegas (2015) ===
Following the release of Positive Force, the band toured with Tame Impala, Mac DeMarco, Dirty Projectors, Tune-Yards and Yeasayer.

=== Till I Burn Up (2019) ===
In 2019, Delicate Steve released Till I Burn Up on Anti-. The album is marked by an exploration of experimental elements and guitar tones inspired in part by Kanye West’s vocals on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, particularly the use of distorted and Auto-Tuned room mics.

The record was met with positive critical acclaim, earning the title of “Best New Music” from Pitchfork.
