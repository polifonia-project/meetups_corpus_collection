Malcolm Greenidge (born July 7, 1974), known as E.D.I Mean and EDIDON, is an American hip hop artist and a member of the Outlawz. The name is a play on the name Idi Amin, former president of Uganda. While in the third grade, Malcolm became friends with Katari "Kastro" Cox who later introduced him to his cousin, Tupac Shakur.

In 1992, Kastro, Greenidge, and Tupac's godbrother Yafeu "Kadafi" Fula, formed a rap trio. Greenridge began rapping under the alias "Big Malcolm". The trio went under the names Thoro Headz and Young Thugs. By then, Tupac had become a rap star and he let them guest appear on his single, "Holla If Ya Hear Me", which was released on February 4, 1993. In 1994, Mutah "Napoleon" Beale joined the group, which was now known as Dramacydal. On March 14, 1995, Tupac's LP, Me Against the World, was released.

In 1995, upon Tupac's release from prison, Greenidge, Tupac, Bruce "Fatal" Washington, Kadafi, Mopreme Shakur, Kastro, and Napoleon formed the group the Outlaw Immortalz, later changed to the Outlawz. Tupac gave each member of the group an alias from an enemy of the United States of America. Shakur gave Greenidge the alias E.D.I. Mean after former Ugandan president Idi Amin. On February 13, 1996, Tupac's double LP, All Eyez on Me, was released. E.D.I. Mean appeared on "Tradin' War Stories," "When We Ride," and "Thug Passion."On June 4, 1996, Tupac's "How Do U Want It" single was released. Its b-side, "Hit 'Em Up", featured E.D.I. Mean, Fatal and Kadafi. It is considered one of the most aggressive diss songs in history, dissing Bad Boy Entertainment, Chino XL, Junior M.A.F.I.A. and Mobb Deep.
On September 7, 1996, Tupac was shot four times in a drive-by-shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was taken to University Medical Center where he died six days later. E.D.I. Mean was in the car behind Tupac, but claimed he could not identify the murderer. E.D.I. Mean and the rest of the Outlawz moved back to the East Coast after Shakur's death. On November 5, 1996, Tupac's LP, The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, was released. E.D.I. Mean appeared on three songs, "Intro/Bomb First (My Second Reply)," "Life Of An Outlaw" and "Just Like Daddy
