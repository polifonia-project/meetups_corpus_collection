He continued his solo career through the early 1980s, releasing an album and several singles between 1981 and 1984. He branched out into TV, co-presenting the Newcastle-based TV music show The Tube with Paula Yates. Holland used the phrase, "be there, or be an ungroovey fucker" in one early evening TV trailer for the show, live across two channels, causing him to be suspended from the show for six weeks.

This gradually became the 18-piece Jools Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra. The Orchestra includes singers Louise Marshall and Ruby Turner and his younger brother, singer-songwriter and keyboard player, Christopher Holland.Between 1988 and 1990 he performed and co-hosted along with David Sanborn during the two seasons of the music performance programme Sunday Night on NBC late-night television.
