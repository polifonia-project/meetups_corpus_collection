Brown University sponsored Riley as its critic-in-residence in 2008.

Riley gave a keynote address at Beatles 2000, the first international academic conference in Jyväskylä, Finland. Since then, he has given lectures on censorship in the arts and rock history.

The honor cited his truthdig.com critique of Peter Guralnick's Sam Phillips biography.
