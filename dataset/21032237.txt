Homer Robert Eanes Jr. was born in Mountain Valley, Virginia and grew up in Martinsville.Eanes learned to play the guitar at an early age despite an injury to his left hand. He had his first musical training as a rhythm guitarist in his father's string band. In 1940, he joined "Roy Hall's Blue Ridge Entertainers" performing at a radio station in Roanoke, Virginia until 1943 when Roy Hall died. In the mid-1940s, Eanes joined "Uncle Joe and the Blue Mountain Boys". He also performed with Flatt & Scruggs, and in 1948, with Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys.In 1949, he made his solo recording debut on the Capitol label together with Homer Sherrill on fiddle and Snuffy Jenkins on banjo. Two years later, in 1951, Eanes formed "The Shenandoah Valley Boys" recording for both the Blue Ridge and Rich-R-Tone label. The Shenandoah Valley Boys performed at radio station "WWVA Wheeling Jamboree". After receiving a recording contract on Decca Records, on the proposal of the A & R man, he changed his musical style from bluegrass to country music. He remained on Decca until 1955, when he began recording for Starday Records renaming his band: "Smilin' Jim and His Boys". His band by now consisted of Roy Russell on fiddle, Allen Shelton on banjo, and Arnold Terry on bass. One of his most popular songs, "Your Old Standby", became his signature song. Another heart touching gospel song he wrote "Not Afraid" was widely recorded by many well known artists.

In the late 1960s, he worked with "Red Smiley and the Bluegrass Cut-Ups" and when Smiley retired, Eanes took over the band calling it "The Shenandoah Cutups".
