== Biography ==


=== 1954-1973: Early years ===
Williams was born in Dargaville, in the Northland region of New Zealand. At the age of 16 he formed a band called 'Face' with classmates. In September 1970, The Face went on to win the Northland heat of the National Battle of the Bands competition, and finishing third overall in the national grand final held in Auckland. In 1971, Face headed to Auckland where they got a gig at the Otahuhu Community Centre paying $20 a week.Lew Pryme of Impact Records was one of the judges in the competition and became their manager. The band were signed to Zodiac Records and released the single "Hangin' Around"/"Mr Postman". A national tour followed. In 1973, Lew convinced Williams to leave Face and join a new television show called 'Free Ride'. 
When the television show "Happen Inn" finished in 1973, a new show emerged. It was called "Free Ride" and was hosted by Ray Columbus. Lew convinced Williams to leave the Face and pursue a solo career at the time the new show was being launched. Williams was well suited for the television role, which allowed him to perform in front of a national audience, gaining exposure. Late in 1974, Williams was signed to EMI Music by Alan Galbraith.


=== 1974-1977: New Zealand fame ===

Late in 1974, Williams released his debut solo single, "Celebration"/"Let Love Come Between Us", but failed to chart. In May 1975, Williams released a song written by Vanda & Young titled "Yesterday Was Just the Beginning of My Life". The song peaked at number 1 on the New Zealand Charts for 3 weeks. The fame stunned the young singer and Williams said “I didn't feel like I was ready for anything. There was constant touring, television, and recording, it was full on.“  Williams' debut self-titled album was released in June and peaked at number 2. The album was certified gold. 
In November 1975, Williams released "Sweet Wine" which peaked at number 7 on the charts. Early in 1976, Lew Pryme took Williams on a promotional visit to Australia.

=== 1978-1989: Australia and Life After Dark ===

By the end of 1977, Williams left New Zealand for Australia. Williams had found being a 'star' in New Zealand was not all fun. He said “The reaction was either absolute adoration or total disgust. Complete opposites. I was very scared of what it created. That’s one of the reasons I left New Zealand, because it was just too scary.”   Record producer Alan Galbraith became the new manager of Williams who signed with CBS Records in Australia. He released the album Life After Dark in 1979, which failed to chart. 
During the 1980s, Williams established himself as a session singer in Sydney singing many radio and TV commercials and become a favoured back up vocalist on albums by major Australian talent including; Eurogliders' Absolutely, The Church's Heyday, Renée Geyer's Live at the Basement and Jenny Morris's Body and Soul.
