Daley Padley, also known as Hot Since 82, is a British DJ, house music producer and DJ Awards winner currently based in Leeds, UK. He has been releasing music under the Hot Since 82 moniker since 2012.


== Personal life ==
Padley entered the electronic music scene at a young age, beginning to frequent area nightclubs at the age of 14. His DJ education started at 17, playing 12–13-hour sets each Sunday at a club in his hometown (under his birth name). His residency soon became a top afterparty destination for clubbers in the area. As word got around, Padley's notoriety increased, resulting in a 2006 residency at Cream Ibiza in Amnesia under the banner of Leeds club Glasshouse.


== Becoming Hot Since 82 ==
In 2010, Padley was attending an Ibiza afterparty when the music suddenly cut out. He plugged his iPhone into the party's speakers, and incidentally, one of his works-in-progress came on. Though Padley had admittedly not made the track with the intent of releasing it, reactions at the party were roundly positive, causing him to contact his friend Danish DJ / Producer Noir, who runs the record label Noir Recordings. Noir was impressed, and released it on his label. 'Let It Ride' came out on Noir Music on September 5, 2011, hitting number three on Beatport's deep house chart. Thus, Hot Since 82 was born.
