Daniel N. Flickinger was an audio engineer in the late 1960s and 1970s, who designed and manufactured some of the era's most important music recording consoles.  He designed recording consoles for Sly Stone, Curtis Mayfield, The Association, Ike Turner's Bolic Sound,  Johnny Cash, and Funkadelic, Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, Motown Records, Cinderella Records, and United Sound Systems among many others.
Flickinger revolutionized recorded music through the "sweepable EQ," an original equalization scheme. Many credit Flickinger with the first design of a working sweepable EQ, while others contend he was one of many who did important work in early EQ innovations. Either way, Flickinger's design of these EQ's would influence his own circuit design, and the work of others worldwide.
