== Influences ==
Miller cited Budgie of Siouxsie and the Banshees as his favourite drummer for having "a signature feel" the Banshees as his favourite band. "Whenever I hear one of their songs, I can hear his drumming and know that it’s him. I love drummers like that. It’s not necessarily that they have a signature sound, but rather a signature feel".
