Finch began her musical career in the mid 1980s.  She played bass in the San Francisco-based band Sugar Babydoll (or Sugar Babylon) from 1984 - 1986.

In 1986, Finch joined the Los Angeles-based punk rock group L7.  In the documentary film L7: Pretend We’re Dead, bandmate Donita Sparks described Finch as "persistent" and stated that after Finch joined the band, her networking skills and stage energy continued to significantly boost the momentum building within the group.

Finch contributed to the albums L7 (1988) Smell the Magic(1990), Bricks Are Heavy (1992), and Hungry for Stink (1994).  Finch was the sole songwriter during this period for several of L7's songs including "(Right On) Thru", "Everglade", "One More Thing", and "Shirley".

In 1995, after the death of her father, Finch adopted the name "Precious" as an homage to him. Finch officially departed L7 in 1996. In the bands 2016 documentary L7: Pretend We’re Dead, Finch cites health and money issues, as well as grieving over the loss of her father and the band’s roadie and friend Umbar as reasons for her departure. 
After departing from L7, Finch wrote music and sang for her band OtherStarPeople with Xander Smith.  OtherStarPeople completed their debut record Diamonds In The Belly Of The Dog in 1998;  the group were signed with A&M Records/Interscope and the album was released in August 1999. Joshua Clover of Spin magazine described the OtherStarPeople record as bringing "less weight and more strangeness than Finch's old crew - it's L.A.-slick and punky-dirty".Finch was also involved with Betty Blowtorch, appearing in the 2003 documentary film Betty Blowtorch And Her Amazing True Life Adventures.Finch founded the punk rock group The Shocker in Los Angeles in 2002.  The band played dates on the Warped Tour in 2003 and 2005.  The Shocker released Up Your Ass Tray as an EP in 2003, followed by a full-length album in 2006 on Go-Kart Records.

=== Photography ===
At the age of 13, Finch began to take photos of her friends in Los Angeles on a camera given to her by her father. These pictures eventually documented the early punk scene that she became involved in before joining L7 in 1986. Her photography (1979–1995) was on display at an LA Weekly sponsored art show at Aidan Ryley Taylor Gallery in Hollywood, until November 18, 2006. The collection, called "14 and Shooting" features a number of notable figures, including photographs of The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bad Religion, Red Kross, and The Cramps.  John Albert of LA Weekly reflected that Finch's images often depict the musicians in more intimate moments as well as providing a generally dark perspective of youth in Southern California.  Finch's photographs traveled to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for display in January 2007.
