== Biography ==
The son of an American father (a member of the U.S. Air Force) and an English mother, Moses was born in the Suffolk county town of Ipswich, but grew up in various parts of the United States and Japan, according to the change of location in his father's postings. A self-taught guitarist, he has been playing since the age of ten and began his professional work by performing material from artists such as Jimi Hendrix, James Brown, The Beatles and Sly and the Family Stone. He was playing on Air Force bases and on radio and TV by the age of 13. When his father retired from the Air Force, the family returned to England, where he has been a freelance musician ever since.
He co-founded the Tex-Mex band Los Pacaminos in 1993, led by Paul Young and has been second guitarist for Brian May and Queen since 1992.
Between 2005 and 2008, he was second guitarist and backing vocalist for Queen + Paul Rodgers. He is a member of The SAS Band with Spike Edney, Hiding In Public, and the party band Jamie & the Falcons (fka The World Famous Red Sox) and also toured for many years with Tom Jones.
Moses has one daughter (Katy Anne, born 1981) and two sons (Benjamin James, b. 1989 and Charles Jackson James (Charlie), b. 2010) and is married to Sarah Louise Moses (n√©e Benton).
