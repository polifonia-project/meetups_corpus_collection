Lin creates virtual instruments including a virtual didgeridoo, a berimbau used by the Brazilian aborigines.

Lin has composed music and painted music as an artist. The 45 paintings in the "Abstraction in Music" Series (1986–1987) is her interpretation of music on canvas, as she is moved by the music of great composers such as Handel (Water Music), Mozart (Jupiter Symphony), Franz Liszt (Rhapsodies dan l'espace), Vivaldi (The Four Seasons), Debussy (La Mer). In addition to the canvases, there are the paperworks subtitled "La Petite Séries" created with different techniques, an abstraction of audio visualisation—perceived images of the sound in music such as Musical Ornaments: Trill, Appoggiatura and Turn (Staccato) and sound in the universe like Woodpecker.
Lin has conceptualised and written about the art in music and music in art. Since 2002, Hsin Hsin has digitally created visual music, or animated music, as she puts it.
2005, Lin built wearables and lights that response to music.
2006, Lin built paradigm shift interactive digital real-world musical instruments—I-Musika


=== Interactive music ===
Lin developed an interactive Music Sound Board in 2006. The creation of this soft sound board enables real time creation of the sound of nature. Examples are elements of sound audible in nature, such as rain forest, insects, water, and wind.


== Poetry ==
Lin speaks, reads and writes in Chinese, English, Japanese and French. She writes poems in these languages
