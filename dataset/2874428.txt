Later Thompson attended a Kansas City high school.By the age of twelve, Thompson was playing private parties with Bennie Moten and his band in Colorado Springs, Colorado. During this time, Count Basie played off and on with Moten's band. During a show Basie called Thompson up to perform. He was dubbed Sir Charles Thompson by Lester Young.
