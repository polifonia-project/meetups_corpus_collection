Kevin Hays (born May 1, 1968) is an American jazz pianist and composer. He began playing in New York while still at high school and led his first record date in 1990. He has recorded more than twenty albums as leader or co-leader, including three each for SteepleChase and Blue Note Records. He led a long-standing trio with bassist Doug Weiss and drummer Bill Stewart, and has also sung with his New Day Trio of bassist Rob Jost and drummer Greg Joseph.


== Early life ==
Hays was born in New York City on May 1, 1968, the youngest of four children. He was raised in Greenwich, Connecticut, and began studying the piano at the age of six, after hearing his father, an amateur player. He was initially interested in rock music and other things that he heard on the radio, and became more interested in jazz in his early teens. Initially self-taught, Hays later had lessons with Lou Stein, and attended several Interlochen Music Camps. Hays played locally from 1982.


== Later life and career ==
Hays started playing in New York in 1985, while still at high school. He then had a period in Nick Brignola's band, and attended the Manhattan School of Music for a semester in 1986 before dropping out to concentrate on performing. His debut recording as a leader came in 1990, for the Japanese label Jazz City. Several of the tracks on this album, El Matador, were his own compositions. During 1991 to 1993, he also recorded three albums for SteepleChase Records."Hays played regularly with a number of Bob Belden's ensembles from the late 1980s, and in the 1990s he toured Japan and recorded with the Harper Brothers (1990) and worked with Steve Wilson, Benny Golson (from c. 1990), Joshua Redman's quartet (1992), Seamus Blake (from 1993), and Eddie Henderson (from 1994)." After the SteepleChase albums, he signed to Blue Note Records, who released three of his albums. In 1995 Hays toured with saxophonist Sonny Rollins.Hays's trio, with Doug Weiss (bass) and Bill Stewart (drums), played together for 15 years. Hays also recorded albums under Stewart's leadership in the 2000s. In 2010â€“11, Hays performed and recorded duets with pianist Brad Mehldau. Also in 2011, Variations, a solo piano album that included interpretations of Robert Schumann, was released by Pirouet Records. Hays formed the New Day Trio, with Rob Jost on bass and Greg Joseph on drums, and also sang on their first release, New Day. This was followed around a year later by North. Hope, a duo album with Lionel Loueke, was released around 2017.


== Playing style ==
"Hays has a linear style and a strong harmonic sense, and uses the pedal to produce a clipped sound, recalling the early work of Paul Bley."
