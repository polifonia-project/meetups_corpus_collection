Harold Spina (21 June 1906 â€“ 18 July 1997) was an American composer of popular songs.  His best-known work happened in the early 1930s, when he collaborated with lyricists Johnny Burke and Joe Young on songs such as "Annie Doesn't Live Here Anymore", "You're Not the Only Oyster in the Stew", "My Very Good Friend the Milkman" (these two hits for Fats Waller), "Shadows on the Swanee", "The Beat of My Heart", "Now You've Got Me Doing It", and "I've Got a Warm Spot in My Heart for You". He also collaborated with lyricist John Elliot for several songs, including "It's So Nice To Have A Man Around The House" (made famous by Dinah Shore).
