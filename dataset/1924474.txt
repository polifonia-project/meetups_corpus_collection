Albert Mangelsdorff (September 5, 1928 – July 25, 2005) was a German jazz trombonist. Working mainly in free jazz, he was an innovator in multiphonics.


== Early life ==
Mangelsdorff was born in Frankfurt on September 5, 1928, as the son of the bookbinder Emil Albert Joseph Mangelsdorff (1891–1963), born in Ingolstadt, and his wife Luise, née Becker (1896–1976), from Wertheim. He was given violin lessons as a child and was self-taught on guitar in addition to knowing trombone. His brother, Emil Mangelsdorff, had a jazz record collection, but during the Nazi period Albert's enthusiasm for the music had to be restrained. Mangelsdorff began his career as a professional musician in 1947 as a rhythm guitarist in the Otto Laufner Big Band, which played in US Army clubs. Mangelsdorff bought his first trombone on the black market for a few cartons of cigarettes. Then he took lessons from the principal trombonist at the Oper Frankfurt, Fritz Stähr (1889–1971).


== Later life and career ==

He played in the bands of Joe Klimm (1950–53) and Hans Koller (1953/54) as well as in the HR Dance Orchestra conducted by Willy Berking (1955–57). Mangelsdorff made his recording debut in 1952, playing with Hans Koller. As the German representative for the Newport Jazz Festival International Band in 1958, he collaborated with the American musicians Gerry Mulligan and Louis Armstrong. From 1959, he performed in the Jazz im Palmengarten series of events.In 1961, he founded his Albert Mangelsdorff Quintet. Mangelsdorff recorded prolifically in the 1960s, including sessions with his own quintet, his brother, and with pianist John Lewis. By the time of his solo performance at the Munich Olympic Games in 1972, he was playing more free jazz. In 1972, he recorded his first solo record Trombirds. "He made solo trombone – a heretofore unknown concept in jazz – a reality via multiphonics, the physically and technically demanding simultaneous blowing and singing of notes into his horn; the method opened vast new dimensions like harmonies and chords".He performed with pianist Chick Corea, cool jazz saxophonist Lee Konitz and bassist Jaco Pastorius. Mangelsdorff later worked with the NDR Big Band, Old Friends (led by Manfred Schoof), and the United Jazz + Rock Ensemble.In 1993, Mangelsdorff was appointed honorary professor for jazz at the Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts. From 1995 to 2001, he directed the Berlin Jazz Festival.


== Personal life ==
Mangelsdorff was married to Ilo. He was the father of countertenor and biologist Ralph Daniel Mangelsdorff (born 1958). Mangelsdorff was a passionate ornithologist. He died in Frankfurt am Main on July 25, 2005. He is buried at the Frankfurt Main Cemetery (Gewann XV 31).


== Legacy ==
