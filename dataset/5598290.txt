However, Stoupe returned to Jedi Mind Tricks in 2014 and Jus Allah left the group for the second time. Stoupe and Paz worked on a new album called The Thief and the Fallen, which was released on June 2, 2015.Stoupe's only full-length solo album Decalogue was released on March 31, 2009, under Babygrande Records. It featured a mixture of underground and popular rappers (for instance M.O.P.) performing over Stoupe's productions.
