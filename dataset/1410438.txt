== Life ==
Ivan Lins was born in Rio de Janeiro. He spent several years in Boston, Massachusetts, while his father, a naval engineer, continued graduate studies at M.I.T., studied at the Military College in Rio. He later received a degree in industrial chemical engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. He considered a career in volleyball before discovering his considerable musical talent. Ivan Lins currently resides in Rio de Janeiro.


== Work ==
Ivan Lins has released albums regularly and penned several standards, such as "Love Dance", "Começar de Novo" (Starting Over) (the English lyric version is titled "The Island", with lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman) and "Velas Içadas", which have made their way north into the American jazz lexicon. "You Moved Me to This", a duet with Brenda Russell from the same album as "Love Dance", saw modest success on American radio. He recorded in English for Reprise/Warner Bros. Records in the early 1990s.
In the mid-eighties Lins recorded a jazz fusion album with Dave Grusin and Lee Ritenour titled Harlequin, which was a critical and commercial success. Lins also composed the soundtrack for the Brazilian film Dois Córregos.
Lins' longtime composing partner is Vítor Martins. Their songs typically feature lush harmony with a distinctive jazz sensibility. One signature voicing he often employs in his own performances is the delayed addition of a ♯11 to a sus13 chord, or the delayed addition of a ♭9 to a sus13 chord.
Lins appeared as a guest performer on the albums Dois Mundos (1998) and Recorded in Rio (2003) by the Dutch artist Josee Koning. He also appeared on the Michael Bublé album Call Me Irresponsible (2007) and with singer/songwriter Paula Cole on her 2007 CD Courage, singing a duet with her on the song "Hard to be Soft". Lins guested on American artist Jane Monheit's album Surrender (2007), which includes his composition "Rio de Maio".
Jazz reporter and music critic David Adler reported Lins's October 2000 Carnegie Hall concert performance and tribute to him. The event corresponded with the tribute album titled A Love Affair, released by Telarc Records. Headline performers from diverse genres participated in celebrating the man and his music on the recording and in the world-class performance hall, a noteworthy accomplishment in the history of any musician.
Lins maintains an active touring schedule, including a 2003 appearance at the Blue Note in New York City. In May 2008 he returned to New York, performing with Rosa Passos at Jazz at Lincoln Center.
Ivan Lins is a political artist and musical icon in his country.
Beyond his own performance of his compositions, Simone is a notable and respected interpreter of his work.
