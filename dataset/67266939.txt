As of 2021 she was the research lead on the European Music Archaeology Project.In the 1970s, Lund began to search for and classify what she termed "sound tools" these were objects in museum collections which could be used to create sound. She developed a classification system for these objects to determine the likelihood that a particular object was used to create sound. One of her favourite sound-producing objects is the 'buzz bone'. Her work has influenced artists, including Ruth Ewan.In 1989 she worked on the interpretation of musical finds which were found in the wreck of the Swedish flagship Kronan.
