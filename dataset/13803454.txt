His work along the way included collaborations with Duane Eddy, Paul Kantner,  the Rolling Stones, and the Who, and Jefferson Starship.Gorman took part in the recording of the Who's album It's Hard and the subsequent tour in 1982.In 1984, he was the keyboardist in The V.U. (sometimes called The View) Phoenix Rising album together with Kevin Chalfant (vocals), Ross Valory of Journey fame (bass guitar), Prairie Prince (drums) and Steff Burns (guitars), all of them musicians whose complete list of acts in which they were involved needed another specific page. Valory and Chalfant later joined again in The Storm which included other former Journey members plus Josh Ramos, a guest guitarist in the V.U. album.
