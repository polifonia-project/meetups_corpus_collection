== Life and career ==


=== Early life and career beginnings ===
At an early age, Aha showed an interest in music, playing trombone in middle school, and playing the drums by the age of 13 at his fatherâ€™s church. Aha began experimenting with music production at 14 years old. By 15, he released his first self-produced mixtape under the name Trill Will. At 18, Aha became fascinated with the piano and taught himself how to play by ear, releasing #TeamGMG the following year. He transitioned from the drums to keyboards and began playing at other churches in his native New Orleans. He attended Grambling State University where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in business management in 2014. He gained further recognition upon releasing Free Barabbas in 2015, which featured the singles "Gettin' Money" and "Vegeta", the latter of which proved to be his most successful single. Aha was signed to Reach Records in 2017 by Lecrae, who had been closely watching the young artist. In 2018, Aha announced that he was leaving Reach Records to pursue other ventures.
Since leaving Reach Records, Aha has released several singles and, in 2020, released a new album, 180.
