Marianna Auenbrugger (19 July 1759 â€“ 25 August 1782) was an Austrian pianist and composer.


== Biography ==
Born in Vienna, Auenbrugger was the daughter of the physician Leopold Auenbrugger. She was a highly regarded pianist and composer in Vienna. Together with her sister Caterina Franziska, she was a student of Joseph Haydn and Antonio Salieri. In 1780, Haydn dedicated a cycle of six sonatas to the two sisters (Hob XVI :35-39 and 20).
When Marianne died in 1782, Salieri, at his own expense, published her Keyboard Sonata in E-flat together with his own funeral Ode De si piacevoli.
