=== Clarinet and bass clarinet ===


==== Soloist ====
A frequent composer for various clarinets, Russell frequently solos as a bass clarinetist, performing his own and other works. Among his own works, he premiered his Sonata for Bass Clarinet and Piano with pianist Kate Campbell which Campbell herself commissioned. Mr. Russell’s performance of Debussy’s Premiere Rhapsody was noted for giving, “increasing energy, leading to a smashingly tangy conclusion from a lurking opening. Russell is a real virtuoso with true command over his instrument’s range of expression…”


==== Sqwonk ====
Along with his partner Jeff Anderle, the bass clarinet duo Sqwonk performed in the San Francisco area. The ensemble has self-released several albums of original music for bass clarinet duo as well as works for small ensemble.
