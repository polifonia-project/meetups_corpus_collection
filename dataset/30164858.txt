Santiago Dobles is known for his use of Bb Tuning, oriental scales, rapid alternate picking and sweep picked legato arpeggios that can cover all seven strings in certain runs. A good example would be from "Garuda", off of their 2006 album Formless, where Santiago repeatedly plays a lick starting on the twelfth fret of the high Eb string and ending in an open (low) Bb string rhythm, a lick that spans across three octaves and a fourth. He also ends the song with a pair sweep picked legato arpeggios that cover all seven strings of his guitar.
in 2011 / 2012 Santiago was the composer and  producer for the incidental  music  for the telenovela Grachi  ( Nick Latino America )
