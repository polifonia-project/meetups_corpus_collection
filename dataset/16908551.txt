Bill Reynolds, bassist for Band of Horses, invited Ramsey to visit him and the rest of the band in South Carolina. Tyler quickly hit it off with lead singer Ben Bridwell, who asked him to open for the band on their fall tour of 2007 and come on board as their new guitar player.
Commenting on the opportunity to play both his solo material and with Band of Horses, Ramsey said, "This is going to be an amazing tour. To have the opportunity to play solo, as well as with such a great band, I really couldn't ask for more."Ramsey has become an integral member of Band of Horses. For their third album, Infinite Arms, he wrote the track "Evening Kitchen" on which he and Bridwell share the lead vocals. He also co-wrote three other tracks.
