She also released a German version of the song. In 1980, while back with Philips Records, Conny released an album of songs by Janis Ian titled Conny Vandenbos zingt Janis Ian.

== Personal life ==
In 1959 Conny married Wim van den Bos. The couple had a daughter. In 1965 this marriage ended, but since she was now known under the name Conny van den Bos, she decided to keep that name. However, the name was now written together as Conny Vandenbos. She now considered this a stage name, no longer the name of her ex-husband. Her second marriage was to Ger Faber, bass player of the band Leedy Trio, with whom she had one son.
In 1971, Vanderbos moved to Hoevelaken, Gelderland. Conny Vandenbos died in Amsterdam on 7 April 2002, two weeks after it was announced that she was suffering from lung cancer.
