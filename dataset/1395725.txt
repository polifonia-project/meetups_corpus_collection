== Music career ==


=== Bridges ===
Furuholmen (keyboards and vocals) formed Bridges with Paul Waaktaar-Savoy (guitars and vocals), drummers Erik Hagelien and Øystein Jevanord, and bassist Viggo Bondi. In 1980, Bridges released their only album, the self-financed LP Fakkeltog. Although the title is Norwegian (meaning torchlight procession), the songs are in English. At the request of A-ha frontman Morten Harket, A-ha performed the Faeltog song "The Vacant" (renamed "Sox of the Fox") during their 2017 MTV Unplugged performance, released as MTV Unplugged – Summer Solstice.


=== A-ha ===
Furuholmen has been the keyboardist with A-ha since their formation in 1982, though he also plays guitar. Magne Furuholmen created the synth-riff of "Take On Me", when he was only 15 years old. In an interview from 2014, Mags revealed it was thanks to Morten Harket that they used the "Take on Me"-riff saying he would quit the band if they didn't. The song "Take On Me" became their biggest hit and was the top 5th streamed song of the 20th century in December 2018. The synth-riff was sampled in the American hit-song "Feel This Moment" featuring Pitbull and Christina Aguilera in 2012.Magne Furuholmen has performed live together with Chris Martin of Coldplay, who introduced Mags as "the best keyboard player in the world".Furuholmen co-wrote most of the a-ha classics with Paul Waaktaar-Savoy, including "Stay on These Roads", "Manhattan Skyline", "Foot of the Mountain", "Cry Wolf", "Move To Memphis", "Minor Earth Major Sky", "Analogue (All I Want)", "Scoundrel Days", "Touchy!", "You Are the One", "Love Is Reason", "Early Morning", "I Call Your Name", "We're Looking for the Whales", "Soft Rains of April", "I Dream Myself Alive", "Little Black Heart", "The Company Man", "The Bandstand", and the band's first and biggest hit "Take On Me". In the 2010 a-ha biography "The Swing of Things", Furuholmen describes one highlight for him: "Stay on These Roads" was a song that I, unusually enough, showed to Morten first - in Paul's apartment. Morten had a brilliant suggestion for a change in the chorus. That song is potentially the best I've ever written".
In the biography, Magne also commented: "Manhattan Skyline" was perhaps one of the most inspired cut and paste projects that Paul and I did. I wrote the quiet part. Paul wrote the rock part."Magne Furuholmen has written or co-written the majority of songs on albums like Lifelines and Analogue, and his co-writing and single track contributions make up most of the tracks on Scoundrel Days, East of the Sun, West of the Moon, Foot of the Mountain and MTV Unplugged – Summer Solstice as well. Mags has written songs such as "Cosy Prisons", "Lifelines", "This is Our Home", "I Wish I Cared", "Mythomania", "Objects in the Mirror", "The End Of The Affair", "Giving Up the Ghost", "Forest Fire" and "Maybe, Maybe" for a-ha, and he takes lead vocals on a couple recorded album songs with a-ha including "The Summers of Our Youth". When a-ha went on hiatus in 1994, Furuholmen began working on other music projects. The band reconvened in 1998, though announced they would split in 2010.

In 2012 the three members of a-ha, Morten Harket, Magne Furuholmen and Paul Waaktaar Savoy, were appointed Knights of the 1st Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav for their contribution to Norwegian music. The Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav is granted as a reward for distinguished services to their country and mankind. The official ceremony took place on 6 November 2012.


=== Solo projects and collaborations ===
Furuholmen's projects outside of A-ha include Timbersound, formed in 1994 with Kjetil Bjerkestrand, and later, Swedish singer, Freddie Wadling. Their work has been used on film soundtracks such as Ti Kniver I Hjertet  (1994), "Hotel Oslo" (1997) which also featured vocals by Anneli Drecker, 1732 Høtten (1998) where the album Hermetic is featured.Furuholmen released his first solo album "Past Perfect Future Tense" in 2004, with appearances from Guy Berryman and Will Champion of Coldplay, and from Andy Dunlop of the Scottish band Travis.
In 2008 Magne Furuholmen released his second solo album titled "A Dot of Black in the Blue of Your Bliss" which includes tracks like "The Longest Night" which later was made into a-ha song "Foot of the Mountain".
In early 2005, Furuholmen featured on a Cat Stevens (Yusuf Islam) song, titled "Indian Ocean", about the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami disaster. The song featured Indian composer/producer A. R. Rahman, Magne Furuholmen and Travis drummer Neil Primrose. Proceeds of the single went to help orphans in Banda Aceh, one of the areas worst affected by the tsunami, through Yusuf's Small Kindness charity.In 2012 Magne Furuholmen was a mentor on the show The Voice – Norges beste stemme. His talent Martin Halla won the contest and had his first album produced by Furuholmen himself who is also a songwriter/producer for other artists.In 2014 Furuholmen agreed to compose the songs and supervise the recordings for the Norwegian film "Beatles".In August 2019 Magne Furuholmen released a new solo song titled This is now America on Instagram, which was the first single form his 2019 album White Xmas Lies. Furuholmen explained that this song was a protest song in direct protest to the Trump administration in an interview with Rolling Stone. The single was published along with a home-made music video directed and edited by his son Thomas.
On 25 October 2019 the album was officially released, and in an interview Furuholmen said he is “ashamed to be part of a Christmas which these days seems 
to be mostly about buying more and more sh** that no one needs or even really wants…a tacky, superficial celebration in stark contrast to the original Christmas message of hope, charity, and compassion”. Furuholmen also described the album as 'a dark, melancholic Christmas record - as an antidote to the cheesy xmas song covers that everyone and his brother churns out these days'.
The artwork for the album is created by Furuholmen himself.On June 19, 2020 Furuholmen releases a new single, Troubled Times, which is a cover of a song by Fountains of Wayne. He also releases a video made with clips sent by fans following an invitation made on Instagram.


=== Apparatjik ===
In 2008 Furuholmen collaborated with Coldplay bassist Guy Berryman and Mew vocalist Jonas Bjerre under the band name of Apparatjik for the theme to the BBC Two series, Amazon. The theme was made available (along with exclusive tracks from various other artists) on the Survival International charity album, Songs for Survival.
In 2010 Apparatjik released their first album We Are Here, a digital album also available physically via their website.
Apparatjik has performed in a cube at venues like The Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, The Serpentine Gallery in London, The State Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen and The Norwegian National Gallery. Apparatjik is described by themselves as an artist collective falling between art and mainstream culture, but happy in the fall.Magne announced on Jo Wiley's show on BBC Radio 2 in October 2010 that he intends to work with his friends in MEW and Coldplay after retiring from A-ha in December.

Furuholmen was born in Oslo, the son of jazz trumpeter Kåre Furuholmen (1940–69) and Anne-Lise Furuholmen (b. 1941). He was raised in Manglerud, Oslo (along with A-ha colleague and co-writer Paul Waaktaar-Savoy). He has one sister, Line, and two half brothers, Thorstein and Trygve Christian. His father, a jazz musician who played trumpet with Bent Sølves Orkester, was killed in an aeroplane crash over Drammen, south of Oslo in 1969, when Magne was just six.  Remarkably, this very accident was witnessed by a nine-year-old Morten Harket, thirteen years before the two were to meet for the first time.Furuholmen married Heidi Rydjord, his high school sweetheart, on 8 August 1992, in the garden of their Nesøya home. They have two sons, Thomas Vincent (born 19 April 1990) and Filip Clements (born 2 October 1993).Furuholmen has previously revealed in interviews that he suffered from a heart disease, however in 2016 he told Norwegian Newspaper "Bergensavisen" that he had a whole new life after undergoing surgery in 2012.
