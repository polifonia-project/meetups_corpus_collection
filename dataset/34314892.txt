=== Musical style and themes: "Sunmi-pop" ===
Sunmi is known in the K-pop industry to have created her own musical style called "Sunmi-pop". It maintains K-pop’s core influences such as pop, disco, rock, traditional Korean music plus retro and city pop elements mixed with Sunmi's own defined music identity.The concept of "Sunmi-pop" was first mentioned by Sunmi herself on You Hee-yeol's Sketchbook at the start of 2018. Later in the year, in an interview for 1TheK's YouTube channel published in September 2018, she revealed that her personal goal was to create her own music style named after herself. The interview was published at a time coinciding with the release of Warning (her first extended play since her renewal as a solo artist) and she referred to the newly published EP as "a stepping stone from which [she] can build [her] own music style".One week ahead of the release of her single "Noir", she mentioned her main goal during a detailed interview for Billboard Korea, hoping that her musical style would become something that could inspire other artists. K-pop fans around the world started to acknowledge Sunmi’s own musical identity by using for the first time the word "Sunmi-pop" in a few tweets, although the term became common on social media only after her fans used it to reply to a tweet posted by Sunmi herself. Even though the tweet itself didn’t mention the term, Korean media and industry players started to officially recognize the word "Sunmi-pop" and implement it in articles and variety shows for the first time to describe Sunmi’s music, reporting that she created her own style by applying her abilities in self-writing, self-composing and ideating performances.On May 30, 2019, in London, right before going up on the stage of the Warning World Tour, an interviewer of the Korean media agency Yonhap News made known to Sunmi that a term to describe her musical style had been coined already as "Sunmi-pop". Thus the word "Sunmi-pop" gained its officiality, and on August 21, 2019, her agency Abyss Company (then known as Makeus Entertainment) also recognized the newly coined word by sharing an article from Naver News which dedicated a section to "Sunmi genre, Sunmi-pop" in anticipation of her comeback with "Lalalay".


==== Characteristics of "Sunmi-pop" ====
The main characteristic of "Sunmi-pop" is defined by the emotions that the songs convey and provoke in the listener. According to Sunmi: "there's always a slightly sad emotion that permeates [my music] no matter how excitingly I sing the song" and "it's energetic and happy but with a sense of sadness". "Sunmi-pop" songs feature upbeat dance rhythms with lyrics marked by metaphors and double meanings that slightly conceal a sense of cynicism.Since "Gashina", Sunmi’s title tracks have featured double meanings and wordplays in the song title such as "Siren", expressing both the meaning of the warning sound and the mythological figure of the siren, and "Lalalay" which both refers to the act of flying [like a butterfly] and the word nallari (날라리) meaning 'punk' or 'party-goer' in Korean. Additionally, the songs "Gashina", "Heroine", "Siren", "Black Pearl", "Curve", "Lalalay" and "Tail" all present metaphors in the lyrics thus defining Sunmi’s style of expression. Although "Sunmi-pop" songs mostly present an exciting and happy beat, Sunmi shared that her lyrics are often imbued with a sense of cynicism due to the fact that, in her real life, as a celebrity, she can’t always express her true feelings. Metaphors, wordplays and double meanings are often expressed through choreographies that complement her work.Though "Sunmi-pop" isn’t constricted within a single music style or genre, electro-pop and retro elements are often associated with Sunmi’s songs. The reason why these elements emerge is to be found in Sunmi’s roots as a member of the Wonder Girls and her time in the US. Sunmi said in a recent interview that producer J. Y. Park wanted her and the other members to "broaden [their] understanding of the different music styles of different eras" focusing especially on retro concepts and Motown artists, which she ended up liking. In a Billboard interview she revealed: "Personally, I like music from the ‘70s, ’80s, and ‘90s, so I try to find instrumentals and sounds that evoke those periods and work them into my music"."Sunmi-pop" is also considered by Sunmi to be a combination of popularity and identity. On the April 2021 issue of L’Officiel Singapore, Sunmi explained: "I always try to come up with fun and easy ways to approach a range of people, while keeping the original emotions in myself". While her aesthetic or themes are considered to be niche, her goal is to remain inside the world of popular music.Another key element of "Sunmi-pop" is dynamism: Sunmi shared her wish of wanting to try new ideas every time, like working with other producers, and explore new genres by showing a different range of themes, aesthetics and sounds through the years.
