With a singular focus, Aaron Smith began his career playing drums in marching band during the sixth grade practicing on the cafeteria tables since there were so many kids wanting to play that instrument. Smith has stated that his influences include James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Stax, RCA, Motown, Ringo Starr and the Beatles' appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. On his first recording session for the song "Push, Push", Smith was paid with "all the hamburgers he could eat".At the age of 20, Smith played drums on The Temptations' recording of "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also won two Grammy Awards at the 15th Annual Awards ceremony - one for Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group Or Chorus and the other for Best R&B Instrumental Performance. Although not formally a member of the Funk Brothers, he performed with them on several Motown albums as a part of the rhythm section. These records include Sky's the Limit (Temptations 71), Solid Rock (Temptations 71), All Directions (Temptations 72), Face to Face with the Truth (The Undisputed Truth 72), Masterpiece (73), The Temptations in Japan (Temptations 73), Keep on Trucking (Eddie Kendricks 73), Me and Rock and Roll Are Here to Stay (David Ruffin 74).

Smith was also a member of the progressive rock group Vector from 1983 through 1985.In 1984, he joined the new wave group Romeo Void.  Although his stint in the band was relatively brief (with the band breaking up the following year), he did perform on their most commercially successful single, "A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)" (along with the rest of the tracks on the accompanying Instincts album) and was even interviewed and invited back to perform with the group for their Bands Reunited episode. Also in 1984, Smith contributed to the 77s' album All Fall Down. He later joined the group officially in 1987, taking part in their albums The 77s (1987), Sticks and Stones (1990), Eighty Eight (1991), The Seventy Sevens (also known as Pray Naked - 1992), and Drowning with Land in Sight (1994) leaving the group in 1995.Smith has also appeared on the following recordings: Simple House (Margaret Becker,  1991), Love Life (Charlie Peacock, 1991), Listen (Cindy Morgan, 1996), The Loving Kind (Cindy Morgan, 1998), Brother's Keeper (Rich Mullins, 1995), Hope Is Born Again (Jim Brickman/Point of Grace, 1997), The Jesus Record (Rich Mullins, 1998), Prayers of a Ragamuffin (A Ragamuffin Band, 2000), A Long Way Back (Kim Richey, 2020) and many more.
