Between her ventures, Leadley describes music as her "first love". Although she has been writing lyrics from as young as 8, she wrote her first full song, "Then I Go", shortly after her parents' divorce when she was 13 or 14. Leadley cites that writing music has helped her through difficult times and much of her music is based on real life experiences, either her own or those of her friends. As she has moved from folk/acoustic to pop punk to pop in terms of her sound, Leadley has stated that her inspirations have changed over time. Damien Rice's O, which her father used to play in the car, made her "fall in love with songwriting to begin with.”

Leadly has been in a relationship with the singer Elyar since February 2017. They officially moved in together in December 2020, and are currently based in Birmingham.
