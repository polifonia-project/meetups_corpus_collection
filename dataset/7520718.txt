Kent McClard is a record label owner and zine publisher from Goleta, California.


== Early life ==
Kent McClard grew up in a "broken home" and describes himself as a troublesome child. As a teenager, he discovered hardcore punk and both its freedom and specific ethics influenced him deeply and helped to "define" his life. From then on, he began several DIY enterprises, including the first show and the first fanzine of his town.


== Ebullition Records ==
In early 1990, the former Maximumrocknroll columnist started Ebullition Records with contributions from Sonia Skindrud (writer of the zine Exedra) and Brent Stephens (member of Downcast). Skindrud came up with the name and Stephens drew the logo, but the label is primarily run by McClard.
Los Angeles hardcore band Inside Out was meant to record an LP as the first Ebullition release. However, Revelation Records asked them to release a 7" instead, and the band chose the more established label. The record was not released for another year, after the band had broken up. Inside Out did plan to do a second record called "Rage Against the Machine", which was a phrase Kent coined in some writings he did in issue #9 of the zine No Answers.


== HeartattaCk ==
HeartattaCk was a punk zine, along the lines of Punk Planet and Maximumrocknroll with a strong bent towards hardcore punk and anti-consumerism. It was published by Kent McClard and Lisa Oglesby from March 1994 through June 2006. In the final years of its publication it remained one of the most popular zines available.  O'Connor describes it as "one of half a dozen major punk fanzines in the USA during the 1990s."
