Randal Edward Brecker (born November 27, 1945) is an American trumpeter, flugelhornist, and composer.  His versatility has made him a popular studio musician who has recorded with acts in jazz, rock, and R&B.


== Early life ==
Brecker was born on November 27, 1945, in the Philadelphia suburb of Cheltenham to a musical family.  His father Bob (Bobby) was a lawyer who played jazz piano and his mother Sylvia was a portrait artist.  Randy described his father as "a semipro jazz pianist and trumpet fanatic.  In school when I was eight, they only offered trumpet or clarinet.  I chose trumpet from hearing Diz, Miles, Clifford, and Chet Baker at home.  My brother (Michael Brecker) didn't want to play the same instrument as I did, so three years later he chose the clarinet!"  Randy's father, Bob, was also a songwriter and singer who loved to listen to recordings of the great jazz trumpet players such as Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown.  He took Randy and his younger brother Michael Brecker to see Davis, Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington, and many other jazz icons.  Brecker attended Cheltenham High School from 1959 to 1963 and then Indiana University from 1963 to 1966 studying with Bill Adam, David Baker and Jerry Coker and later moved to New York and performed with Clark Terry's Big Bad Band, the Duke Pearson and the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra.


== Career ==
In 1967, Brecker ventured into jazz-rock with the band Blood, Sweat & Tears, on their first album Child Is Father to the Man, but left to join the Horace Silver Quintet. Brecker recorded his first solo album, Score, in 1968, featuring his brother Michael Brecker.
After Horace Silver, Randy Brecker joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers before teaming up with brother Michael, Barry Rogers, Billy Cobham, and John Abercrombie to form the fusion group Dreams. The group recorded two albums: Dreams and Imagine My Surprise  for Columbia Records before they disbanded in 1971.
In the early 1970s, Brecker performed live with many artists including The Eleventh House, Stevie Wonder and Billy Cobham. He also recorded several albums with his brother under pianist/composer Hal Galper.
By 1975, Randy and Michael formed the Brecker Brothers band. They released six albums on Arista and garnered seven Grammy nominations between 1975 and 1981.  Their first record, The Brecker Bros., featured Randy's composition "Some Skunk Funk", and he composed several pieces on this and subsequent albums.
After the Brecker Brothers disbanded in 1982, Randy recorded and toured as a member of Jaco Pastorius' Word of Mouth big band. It was soon thereafter that he met and later married Brazilian jazz pianist Eliane Elias. Eliane and Randy formed their own band, touring the world several times and recording one album named after their daughter together, Amanda on Passport Records.
In 1977 he founded the jazz club Seventh Avenue South with his brother Michael Brecker.

In 1992 Randy and Michael reunited for a world tour and the triple-Grammy nominated GRP recording The Return of the Brecker Brothers.  The follow-up, 1994's Out of the Loop, was a double-Grammy winner. In 1995 he was featured on Turtles, an album by Polish composer Włodek Pawlik.In 1997, Into the Sun (Concord), a recording featuring Brecker's impressions of Brazil, garnered Brecker his first Grammy as a solo artist.

The WDR Big Band also invited Brecker to perform at the [Jazz Fest]. The date was of significance to Randy as it was the last time he played with his brother, who took ill shortly thereafter with a rare form of leukemia known as MDS.
In 2005, Brecker's wife Ada (married 2001) sat in for the first time. Brecker's schedule continued with the Randy Brecker Band performing throughout Eastern Europe.
