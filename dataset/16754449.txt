Peter Schilperoort (1919 â€“ 1990), also known as Pat Bronx, was a Dutch musician, famous for his work with the Dutch Swing College Band, and projects with other well-known musicians. He is most recognised as a saxophone and clarinet player, but also played the guitar and the banjo. Leading the Dutch Swing College Band from 1946 to 1955, then from 1960 to 1990, his style was Dixieland, a style popular at the start of the twentieth century. His band became widely popular across Europe, Australia, Asia and South America in 1960, known as a Dixieland revival band.
The DSC toured in 1964 and played at the Bromley Court Hotel and much later played at the Fairfield Halls in Croydon in the late 1980s. One of the best tributes to this musician and his band was that by the trumpeter Louis Armstrong who stated the DSC was the best exponent of traditional jazz in Europe.
