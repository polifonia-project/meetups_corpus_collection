== Controversies ==
On April 18, 2020, Flow G had beef with FlipTop Isabuhay Champion Sixth Threat. He released his diss track entitled "Unli", a response to "Pilipinong Wack" by 3 Digitz, a Sixth Threat group. A few weeks later, he released his second diss track entitled "Pasaload", a response to "Expired" by Sixth Threat, pointing out Flow G in the song.
Netizens were suspicious of Gloc-9 for 'alluding' Sixth Threat on his social media accounts. Sixth Threat also called out Gloc-9 for being Flow G's 'ghost writer' in the making of "Pasaload".In September 2020, Flow G released a promotional track "Deym" to endorse their clothing line "Brand for 199x", involving Skusta Clee as an ambassador of the brand. They were allegedly accused of plagiarizing the song "Ddaeng" by BTS, which was released on SoundCloud in 2018. Surprisingly, the group's management debunked allegations and made a clarification that the two songs are 'inherently different'. The manager also claimed that the artists used a generic flow and added that â€œparallel thinking among artists do happen and it cannot be avoided".On August 15, 2021, Flow G released his single entitled 'G Wolf' with an accompanying music video directed by Titus Cee. The music video has amassed over 5 million views in the first two weeks on YouTube and has over 22 million views to date. The controversial piece is a response to last year's feud with Sixth Threat and a direct slam to his detractors. Months later, OneMusicPH described it as it's "almost like Larry Bird telling his defender where he'll shoot the ball on the deciding play and still makes the shot."
