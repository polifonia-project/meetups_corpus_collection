== Critical reception ==
Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles described the ensemble as "Marrying the ceaseless brutality coming out of New York and New England to the hyper-blasting intensity endemic to Quebecois death metal", going on to state that Mechanisms Of Omniscience is "as unrelenting as it is passionate" and that the album "tackles real world issues with intelligence and raw emotion".Metalsucks describes the song "Cymatic Hallucinations" as "if Abnormality took all the best elements of modern tech-death, mashed it up with the old school variety, infused it with a sense of groove rarely felt in metal’s more technical corners and created one seething, roaring, fire-breathing death metal beast".Blabbermouth describes debut album Contaminating The Hive Mind as "cementing their status as one of the heaviest and most dynamic bands in the [extreme metal] genre".
