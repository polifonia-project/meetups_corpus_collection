== Career ==
After completing high school at Domarhagsskolan, Nylander studied on the Jazz program at Trondheim Musikkonservatorium (2002–04). He fold recognition on the Norwegian and Nordic jazz scenes within various projects and contributed on a number of releases, among them the album Corrupted Mirror (2009), in a meeting with Karl Stømme (trumpet) and Steinar Nickelsen (keyboard). The album took shape in the studio where the musicians met without any specific intention to record an album. The idea was to use the three instruments in interaction playing all kinds of music, coming naturally in the moment. The recordings were made in three different sessions. Most of the tracks are improvised on the spot, but also includes compositions written by Strømme and Nickelsen. The Oberheim OB-X synthesizer from 1980 was crucial for the album soundscape.In 2005 he performed at the international Jazz festival Nattjazz in Bergen, Norway, with Marita Røstad & "Velvet City". The album A festa Vale Tudo (2009) within his Erik Nylanders Orchestra (including Eivind Lønning, Espen Reinertsen, Hanna Gjermundrød, Ole Morten Vågan and Petter Vågan) marked Nylander's debut as a record producer and band leader. He has also collaboratively initiated several other band projects.
