== Biography ==
Hutto was born in Richmond County, Georgia, but grew up in Covington, Georgia . Hutto was not popular at his school, frequently got into fights, and experimented with drug use. He listened to heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Metallica, and Sepultura, and he played bass guitar in several local metal bands throughout the early 2000s before being a member of "Southern Hustlas Inc." and seeking a solo career as a rapper under the name "Turncoat Dirty".


== Signing to Psychopathic Records, creating Boondox, The Harvest era (2005–2006) ==
Hutto caught the attention of Insane Clown Posse while selling his cassettes at one of their concerts. Following several phone calls with group member Joseph Bruce, Hutto was signed to Psychopathic Records, making him the first Southern hip hop performer on the label. Bruce and Joseph Utsler helped Hutto create the character Boondox, which took six months to fully develop. Hutto released his first album under the Boondox name, The Harvest, on July 11, 2006. A music video directed by Bruce was filmed for the album's first single, "They Pray With Snakes" and Hutto toured with Blaze Ya Dead Homie to promote the album. The second music video from the album is "Red Mist" (ft. Twiztid & Blaze Ya Dead Homie).


== PunkinHed EP era (2007) ==
In 2007, Hutto released the extended play PunkinHed. It peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart and No. 27 on the Top Independent Albums chart. During the same year, he joined Psychopathic Rydas, performing under the name "Yung Dirt".


== Krimson Creek era (2008–2009) ==
On May 13, 2008, Hutto released his second studio album, Krimson Creek, a more personal work drawing from his past.

== Departure from Psychopathic Records, restarting Turncoat Dirty (2012–2013) ==
In early 2012 Boondox released 2 songs from his upcoming album. The two songs were "Abaddon" and "Monster". He said they were released as a thank-you to all the fans that have stood by him, and have supported him. He said that he has about 10 songs done for the album. In May 2012, Boondox's Twitter account was "hacked", and Hutto announced that he would be leaving Psychopathic because of personal issues, but is still on good terms with the label. He also plans to release a gangsta rap album independently under the alias Turncoat Dirty, and is currently in the production of a new Boondox album. Boondox teamed up with Bukshot and ClaAs to form the group The Underground Avengers, and they released their debut EP, Skarecrows, Weirdos & ClaAsholes at the 2012 GOTJ.
