== Career ==
Before pursuing music, Muller worked in an American Apparel shop on Oxford Street, as well as a bar in Kentish Town. She has expressed her gratitude at having worked rather than attending university, since it "pushed [her] to work hard". Muller attended Fine Arts College, in Belsize Park. Muller began writing songs at the age of 19, and released a song titled "Close". She approached a friend who plays guitar and uses Logic Pro to help her produce the song, which she released on SoundCloud. She stated that she "gave him a bottle of wine for doing it", since she "had no money". The attention received from the song led to her quitting her job and working on music full-time. After uploading a video of her singing onto Instagram, Muller was discovered and signed by her manager. She stated that her lack of writing experience prior to the release of the song "worried her" when she began writing her debut extended play. The EP, After Hours, was released in February 2018, and was described as a "bold, confident first step" by DIY. After Hours was followed by the release of her second EP, Frankly, in September 2018, which A1234 described as a "stunning piece of work", and noted that Muller is "one to watch".On 5 April 2019, Muller released her debut studio album, titled Chapter 1. She then went on to become a supporting act for Little Mix, along with boy band New Rules, on the British leg of their LM5: The Tour. Following the tour, she released a single titled "Therapist", which she had performed on the tour prior to its release. Alongside the release of "Therapist", Muller also announced her first national tour, visiting five cities across the United Kingdom. In September 2020, Muller announced that her third EP would be released on 6 November 2020. The EP, titled No One Else, Not Even You, will be supported by a headline tour across the United Kingdom and Europe. The video for one of its songs, "So Annoying", was directed by Sophie Muller, who is not related to Mae.In 2021, Mae Muller appeared as guest vocalist on "When You're Out", Billen Ted's follow-up to their number one hit "Wellerman.
