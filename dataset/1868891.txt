"After rehearsing for a few days we recorded our first demo in Atlanta and all agreed we had something special going on. The band was formed, almost... Once we had about 10 songs, the band decided that we could use another guitarist to augment the sound. I called up my friend Mark Chaussee who came in and played with us for about two months. Things didn't work out with Mark and we tried out a bunch of other guys." – Erik Rogers (Stereomud vocalist), PRP.

== Marilyn Manson ==
Chaussee joined Marilyn Manson in autumn 2004 replacing the recently departed John 5, as a temporary live guitarist (2004–2005) for the Against All Gods world tour in support of Marilyn Manson's greatest hits collection Lest We Forget (2004), where tours proceeded from October, 27th, 2004 till August, 31, 2005.
Chaussee's style of play featured an original and exotic heavy sound, similar to "old-school" heavy metal – crude and unpolished, contrasting the glam-rock influences of former guitarist John 5 and the former style of the band as a whole. Mark lent a more rigid, gloomy and aggressive sound to the band. "I thought Mark added something great and different to the tour. We haven’t had the opportunity to write songs together" – Marilyn Manson.
