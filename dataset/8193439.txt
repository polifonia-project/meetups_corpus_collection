== Career ==
During the late 1990s, Nick Speed formed a hip-hop crew called 9-2-5 Colony with classmates Magestik Legend and iLLite, both of whom would go on to become part of the Subterraneous Records stable of artists.While still in high school, Speed and Magestik spent a significant amount of time with DJ House Shoes, who assisted them with their first production experiments while also introducing them to other like-minded artists in the Detroit hip-hop community. Among these artists were Elzhi, who was then part of the Breakfast Club, and One Be Lo, who was part of Binary Star.Speed and Magestik Legend invited Elzhi to become a part of the 925 Colony in 1999, shortly after Elzhi had completed recording his unreleased EP, Out of Focus. The new trio recorded only a few songs, none of which were released. Among these are "Farewell," produced by Lacks, "Oh Shit," and "Gun Talk."With Magestik Legend's growing involvement with the Subterraneous crew, and Elzhi's affiliation with Waajeed and Slum Village, the 9-2-5 Crew found little time to write, record or perform music. Nick Speed became a freelance producer for many underground artists. Among the projects Speed worked on during this era was the unreleased record Inside Out by iLLite. This fruitful collaboration inspired the pair to work on a separate, full-length project, dubbing themselves the "People Movers".


=== G-Unit and Libido Sounds ===
Towards the end of 2004, friends and longtime collaborators Nick Speed and Elzhi teamed up to release Witness My Growth, a double-CD mixtape chronicling Elzhi's long, secretive history as a solo artist. To facilitate the release of this long-gestating project, the two created "Libido Sounds," an independent imprint dedicated to releasing quality hip-hop music.A collection of Speed's beats found its way to the hands of Sha Money XL, who offered Nick an in-house production contract and management deal. Through this deal, Nick has produced tracks for many of today's most popular and influential emcees. He worked with Lloyd Banks the most during his time at g-unit and recurrently produced on "Cold Corner 2" Lloyd Banks also contacted Nick for his third studio album "The Hunger For More 2" where he produced "Home Sweet Home. Nick has been quoted as saying he has produced at least 10 records for Lloyd Banks alone. Some are on albums some are on mixtapes".In August 2007, Nick Speed released the D-Tour Mixtape which showcases his versatility as a producer as well as an emcee. The double CD features many of Speed's collaborations with mainstream stars like 50 Cent and Lloyd Banks, but also displays the talents of other Detroit artists such as 87 and Fes Roc.During his time at G-Unit Nick developed a relationship with Dr. Dre protege at the time Bishop Lamont and despite both parties no longer being associated with G-Unit/Aftermath they recently collaborated on a record called "Don't Stop" featuring Mopreme Shakur
