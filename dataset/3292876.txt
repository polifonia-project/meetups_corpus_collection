Florence Warner (born March 22, 1947) is an American singer who has worked mainly in recordings of television commercials, including the "Hello News" image campaign from Gari Communications. She was born in Atlanta, Georgia.
Warner appeared on several recordings in the 1970s and early 1980s, including a duet with Demis Roussos on his cover of Air Supply's "Lost in Love" (from the 1980 album, Man of the World). Her recording of the song "Pirate" was selected by Philips for inclusion on the demonstration disc (810 027-2) that came with the first compact disc players, such as the Philips model CD200. In 1984, she sang on the ABC network campaign, "We're With You on ABC" (a campaign using character actors playing the roles of people watching ABC shows throughout the day).
