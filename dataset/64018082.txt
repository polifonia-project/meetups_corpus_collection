Lwazi Asanda Gwala, better known as DJ Lag  is a South African DJ and record producer. He is regarded as the pioneer of Gqom, a genre of electronic dance music that emerged in the early 2010s in Durban, South Africa. In 2019, DJ Lag notably collaborated with Tierra Whack, Beyoncé, Moonchild Sanelly, Nija, Yemi Alade, and Busiswa on a track called "My Power" on Beyoncé's album, The Lion King: The Gift.


== Early life ==
With aspirations of becoming a soccer player growing up in Durban, Lag suffered an ankle injury which derailed his pursuits. His cousin, a rapper within the Durban hip hop scene at the time, then introduced him to FL Studio, on which he taught himself to produce. Following this, he began to explore DJing. He went on to play his first gig at Durban's club Uhuru during a high school graduation event while he was in 10th grade. Lwazi Asanda Gwala finished his Matric at Wyebank Secondary School located in South Africa in the  Wyebank area. 


== Career ==
Releasing his first EP on Whatsapp, DJ Lag began is career using methods unorthodox to Western distribution methods common in Gqom's formative years. Fans signed up on the DJ's website with the promise that an exclusive EP would be delivered to them via the mobile messaging app free of charge, with the help of Black Major, an artist management agency based in Cape Town.  DJ Lag's specific style is known to be focused on what local producers dubbed "uthayela" (an isiZulu word for "corrugated iron" which describes the rough timbre and hard bass-lines specifically made for listening to in  club settings.
Music connoisseurs who were pivotal in influencing the genre's international acclaim included the likes of South African rapper Okmalumkoolkat, Italian record label Gqom Oh owner, Malumz Kole inclusive of music taste-maker and  public relations liaison, Cherish Lala Mankai, DJ Tira and Babes Wodumo.
In late 2016 at the age of 21, DJ Lag made his live global debut at the Unsound Festival in Poland and finishing up at Seoul’s Cake Shop nearly a month later. Since then, he’s performed at Afropunk New York City and secured a residency at RinseFM. He also embarked on a four-part worldwide tour called #GqomIsThePresent and was featured on BBC Radio 1, including shows by Diplo and Benji B, with a BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix set hosted by Pete Tong. DJ Lag was a featured speaker at the 2019 Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE).In 2019, he released a 6 track EP entitled UHURU under Diplo's American record label, Good Enuff Records, under the Mad Decent umbrella. This album paid homage to DJ Lag's hometown club of the same name, which acted as a monumental meeting place for Gqom producers such as Rudeboyz and Naked Boyz, to try out new techniques on larger audiences. In 2019, DJ Lag began to curate and host his own event, called Something For Clermont  where new acts are encouraged to experiment with sounds contributing to the evolution of the genre, the first of which was held in partnership with music broadcaster Boiler Room.
