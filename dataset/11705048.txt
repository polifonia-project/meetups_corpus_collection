=== Beginning and early career ===
Mango was born in Lagonegro, province of Potenza. He grew up listening mainly to soul and hard rock music, his favourite musicians included Aretha Franklin, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Peter Gabriel.

In 1976 Mango recorded his first album, La mia ragazza è un gran caldo. Two songs from the album, "Per te che mi apri l'universo" and "Tu pioggia io mattino", attracted the attention of Patty Pravo, who put them on her album Tanto (1976), though, the title of the second song was changed in "Per amarti d'amore". Mia Martini also liked Mango's music and covered the song "Se mi sfiori" on the album Che vuoi che sia... se t'ho aspettato tanto (1976).
He released other records like Arlecchino (1979) and È pericoloso sporgersi (1982). His first three works did not receive attention by the media, pushing Mango to abandon the music career but the meeting with lyricist Mogol changed his mind.
