Jarmil Michael Burghauser (born Jarmil Michael Mokrý, 21 October 1921, Písek – 19 February 1997, Prague) was a Czech composer, conductor, and musicologist.
After the short-lived Prague Spring, he incurred the disfavor of his country's Communist regime and had to adopt the pseudonym Michal Hájků in order to write a series of compositions in a style which evoked earlier periods of music, called Storia apocrifa della musica Boema.


== Cataloguing of  Dvořák's works ==

Burghauser created a reliable catalog of works by Antonín Dvořák. It is to replace the traditional  opus number, which is not only incomplete but also confusing for the case of Dvořák. Today academic references to Dvořák's works often use the Burghauser number from the catalogue.
