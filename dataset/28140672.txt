Straight No Chaser wrote "New Territories represents the arrival of a talented artist and perceptive one-man production house."After a two-year absence Lau returned in 2010 with a new EP titled "Kilawatt: V2", as the second instalment of the producer series released by Kilawatt. The release was received positively by both critics and fans.
On 27 September 2010, Lau released a 20-track instrumental LP entitled "Makin' Sound".
In February 2011, Lau followed up "Makin' Sound" with "Quadrivium", another 20-track instrumental project, featuring music inspired by the John Martineau book of the same name.
In November 2011, Lau released "The Mission - Single" with Detroit rapper Guilty Simpson and Georgia Anne Muldrow contributing a remix.
