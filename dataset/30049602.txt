The title of his first EP Panesian Nights was chosen in reference to the developer of Japanese erotic video games.In addition to his own recordings, Silver has also remixed songs for other artists, including Holy Ghost!, Crystal Castles, Sally Shapiro, The Presets, Health, Azari & III, Harald Grosskopf and Owen Pallett.
