The DJ has become notable for his hits, "Bad Girl (At Night)" with Lisa Maffia and "Baditude" with Sam Obernik. His first release as Shadow Child was on Dirtybird Records in March 2012, and he's since formed his own record label, Food Music, alongside Lewis of Kry Wolf.

== Biography ==
Simon Neale grew up listening to a mixture of synth-pop and early '90s house & rave, and attended a secondary school that had an undiscovered TB-303 and Juno 60 in the music room cupboard.
Using his Dave Spoon alias, he's established himself on the UK dance scene. He signed "21st Century" to Toolroom Records in 2004. The piano-led "Sunrise EP" followed and was signed to Seamus Haji's Big Love imprint.
In 2006, Spoon released "At Night". With an added vocal in 2007 from Lisa Maffia, the track crossed over as "Bad Girl (At Night)" on Universal, earning Spoon his first top 40 hit, with the second coming in 2008 in the form of "Baditude" with collaborators Sam Obernik & Paul Harris from Dirty Vegas.
He followed this with DJ compilations for Ministry of Sound & Toolroom, remixes of songs by artists like Dizzee Rascal and The Pet Shop Boys, plus updates of classics such as Gat Décor's "Passion", having landed a residency on Radio 1's 'In New DJs We Trust' in 2008 and a residency for Cream in Ibiza.
His 2008 single "Baditude" entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 34 on downloads alone on 10 August. The following week, the song climbed to No. 29. He has launched his own label "Televizion", where he released the Pete Tong collaboration "Gas Face", which was used as title music for the Hammer Horror film Beyond the Rave.
"Friday" featuring Takura managed to enter the UK Singles Chart at number 193 after support from the likes of MistaJam on BBC Radio 1Xtra.
