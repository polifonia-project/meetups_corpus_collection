== Biography ==


=== Early life and career ===
Sugiyama was born in Isogo-ku, Yokohama on July 17, 1959 to his father, a police officer, and his mother, a shamisen teacher. While in elementary school, he wanted to be a manga artist and was invited to his friend Miura's house to make a manga. While in his friend's home, Miura's brother listened to The Beatles, and borrowed the record to listen to while drawing. He stopped drawing after and bought Let It Be in 5th grade with his own pocket money. He attended Yokohama Municipal Okamura Junior High School and Yokosuka Gakuin High School. In 1980, he became the lead vocalist of the band "Kyutipanchosu," which won the 19th Popcon with their song, "Gospel No Yoru." After the debut of Kyutipanchosu and receiving the Popcon prize, Sugiyama was unsatisfied with the song, feeling that it was incomplete. He refused the invitation from Popcon and sought to make his own debut. Koichi Fujita, a producer who was president of Triangle Productions, paid attention to Sugiyama after the win, presenting Sugiyama with an idea to change the band's name. In 1983, the band changed their name from "Kyutipanchosu" to "Kiyotaka Sugiyama & Omega Tribe," debuting with the single, "Summer Suspicion."

"Summer Suspicion" peaked at No. 9 on the Oricon charts while their freshman album, Aqua City, reached No. 4. 
The band continued to make music until the end of 1985, when Sugiyama proposed that the group have a "developmental dissolution" and break up. Takashima and Nishihara initially opposed the dissolution, but the group decided that it would happen, and the greatest hits album, Single's History, would be the last album. At the suggestion of producer Tetsuji Hayashi, it was decided that they would make another album called First Finale. First Finale was released on December 11, 1985, with the band breaking up 13 days later.

The "Solo debut 20th Anniversary The Open Air Live High & High 2006" concert was scheduled on August 6, but cancelled due to Sugiyama's poor condition at the time. Sugiyama commented, "It's the first time I've been living for 47 years and being so conscious of a cold. I'd like to continue my musical activities for the next 30 or 40 years."

Sugiyama was known to wear a pair of sunglasses during concerts and in pictures. He did not wear sunglasses at the beginning of his career, but shortly thereafter, appeared in the media in black sunglasses. This was to hide the swelling of his face after a live performance by covering it just before his debut, but since it was well received by fans, he continues to do so. He was known during this time as "a top class man who looked good with sunglasses." However, during the performance of "Futari no Natsu Monogatari" in The Best Ten, he took off his sunglasses while singing. His face without the sunglasses can now often be seen during concerts and in photos.

The two had previously met during the after party of the 19th Popcon. They had one daughter, Maho, a year after they married. The three had moved to Hawaii and lived in Hawaii Kai, going back and forth between Los Angeles, Japan, and Hawaii for recording activities.
