Martin James "Boz" Boorer (born 19 May 1962 in Edgware, Middlesex, England) is an English guitarist and producer most known for his work founding the new wave rockabilly group The Polecats; and later for his work as a co-writer, guitarist and musical director with Morrissey, for which he is principally known today.


== The Polecats ==
The band Cult Heroes was formed in 1977 by Tim Worman (known as Tim Polecat, vocalist), Boz Boorer (guitarist and vocalist), Phil Bloomberg (bassist), and Chris Hawkes (drummer). After finding much difficulty persuading promoters to book them on the rockabilly circuit with a name sounding "too punk", they adopted Hawkes' suggested band name The Polecats. Hawkes was later replaced by Neil Rooney. Three years after forming, the band signed to the fledgling British rockabilly record label Nervous Records, and released the single "Rockabilly Guy" in 1979.By 1980 the Polecats had signed to Mercury Records. That same year they released their most successful LP, Polecats Are Go!.  The band had UK chart success with a David Bowie cover "John, I'm Only Dancing", a reworking of "Rockabilly Guy", and another cover version of the T.Rex song "Jeepster". In 1983, they entered the charts in the United States with their song "Make a Circuit With Me". Shortly after, John Buck replaced Neil Rooney on drums. Boorer left the group in the same year but in 1989 he led a 1989 Polecats reunion which produced a live album and a new studio set. Raucous Records released a compilation album of Boz Boorer's work entitled Between The Polecats in early 2001. The band continue to tour when time permits, with the most recent gig being at The Hot Rod Hayride in Bisley, Surrey, UK, on 30 July 2016.


== Morrissey ==
Boorer, along with guitarist Alain Whyte, joined Morrissey in 1991 when the singer assembled a new band tour in promotion of his album Kill Uncle. With Whyte, he is credited with successfully synthesizing jangle pop and American rockabilly to create a new sound for Morrissey that helped to revitalize his career. Since 1991, Boorer has worked not only as one of Morrissey's co-writers and guitarists but also as the band's musical director.In 1994, Boorer produced for the first time a record for Morrissey: it was for the single "Interlude", a duet between Morrissey and Siouxsie, a one-off released under the banners of both artists. Boorer notably directed the strings section.


== Solo career and other work ==
Boorer has released solo material between his recording and touring. In 2008, he released the album Miss Pearl. Besides having a solo career, writing and playing for Morrissey and touring occasionally with the Polecats, Boorer has worked with other artists, including Adam Ant, Kirsty MacColl, Joan Armatrading, Jools Holland, and Edwyn Collins. He also worked with his wife's band, the Shillelagh Sisters, between 1983 and 1998.
In 2009, Boorer produced the debut EP by Tiguana Bibles, "Child of the Moon".
He and his wife own a studio in Portugal, Serra Vista Studio. In summer 2010, Boorer recorded, produced and mixed Portuguese garage/blues/rock band Murdering Tripping Blues' second album, "Share the Fire".
In 2011, Happy Martyr was formed with rapper Alex Lusty. The plan was to record some acoustic, stripped-down hip-hop, which Boorer described as "an MC fronting early Tyrannosaurus Rex". The albums One Square Mile and Nothing Like Love were released in 2012 and 2014 respectively.
In August 2012, Boorer released his fourth solo album, "Some of the Parts", and the single "Slippery Forces" on Fabrique Records. The song "Saunders Ferry Lane" features the vocals of James Maker. "Sunday Morning Coming Down" is a cover of the Kris Kristofferson song. John Moore of Black Box Recorder and The Jesus and Mary Chain appears as a special guest on diverse instruments.
In June 2014, Boorer teamed up with Art Brut (band) singer Eddie Argos for a new solo single, "Girl From Atlanta", which was included on his solo album "Age Of Boom" in 2016 for Fabrique Records.


== Personal life ==
Boorer has been married to Lyn since 1981, and they have two daughters: Pearl-May and Billie-Rose.
