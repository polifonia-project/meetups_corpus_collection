Étienne "Sarane" Ferret (1912–1970) (surname also later spelled Ferré on occasion) was a French musette and gypsy jazz guitarist and composer, a contemporary and musical associate of Django Reinhardt, and the brother of noted Gitan (gypsy) guitar players Baro and Matelo Ferret. He recorded with his own quintet in Paris in the 1940s and continued performing there, with occasional recording sessions, until his death in 1970.


== Biography ==
Sarane Ferret was the middle-born of the three Ferret brothers, Gitan gypsies from Rouen, France who made their way to Paris and there made the acquaintance of Django Reinhardt in 1931. He was known by his Gypsy nickname "Sarane". From 1931, the Ferret brothers Baro, Matelo and Sarane, and cousin René "Challain" Ferret, were favorite sidemen of Reinhardt. He initially made his name as a banjo player in Bals Musette, including with the Italian accordionist Vétese Guérino. He also accompanied Eastern European Gypsies in the Russian cabarets.
He formed his own quintet in the 1940s, incorporating clarinets on occasion as well as the violin of Georges Effrosse into the "classic" gypsy jazz lineup (Effrosse's tenure with the quintet was short-lived, however, dying in a Nazi concentration camp in 1944); Sarane's original compositions included "Cocktail Swing", "Royal Blue" and "Surprise-Party" as well as recording versions of compositions by Django Reinhardt. Sarane continued to perform through the 1950s and 1960s, though without the recognition of his wartime quintet recordings; at times his bands a variety of accompanists including Jaques "Montagne" Mala, Laro Sollero, René Mailhes and others. Married to Gusti Malha's daughter Poupée, he resided in Paris up to his death in 1970, which was marked by a tribute concert by the gypsies at the Olympia Hall in Paris, issued on record as "La Nuit des Gitans". His musical legacy was continued by Francis-Alfred Moerman (1936-2010) who accompanied Sarane many times from 1960 onwards.,


== Musical style ==
While Sarane's Swing Quintette was modelled on that of his great contemporary Django Reinhardt, his sound was somewhat different; commentator Michael Dregni states: "I hear in Sarane's fretwork a more deliberate, perhaps cautious guitarist... [his songs] imbued with a remote, even mysterious atmosphere... melodies floating on entrancing airs of minor-key wistfulness." For most of his career he is pictured with, and recorded with a Selmer guitar as indeed, were most French guitarists of the day; towards the end of his life he also recorded in a more mainstream, electric style as evidenced on his tracks on the album Tribute To Django recorded in 1967 for French radio (album released later, in 1989).
