Bertha Frensel Wegener-Koopman (27 September 1874, in Bloemendaal – 17 July 1953, in Amsterdam) was a Dutch composer and music educator.


== Biography ==
Bertha Koopman studied composition and piano at the Amsterdam Conservatory and continued studying with composer Bernard Zweers and vocal pedagogue Hugo Bellwidt in Frankfurt. After completing her studies, she performed concerts in Germany and the Netherlands.
Koopman married Jolen Frensel Wegener and retired from the concert stage to a career as accompanist, teacher and composer in Haarlem. Koopman's early songs included German lyrics, but after World War I, she wrote her songs in French and English, which allowed her access to markets in New York City, Chicago and St. Louis. Her daughter Emmy Frensel Wegener (1901–1973) was a violinist and composer of chamber music.
