Steven Howse (born September 23, 1974), known professionally as Layzie Bone, is a rapper known primarily for being a member of the group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. He has also gone by the names L-Burna and The #1 Assassin. He is the younger brother of fellow group member Flesh-N-Bone and cousin of group member Wish Bone. Layzie is also a member of the rap group Bone Brothers and CEO of the record label Harmony Howse Entertainment.


== Music career ==
The group formed the band B.O.N.E. Enterpri$e (all except for Flesh-N-Bone) and recorded an album entitled Faces Of Death in the studio of their then mentor, Kermit Henderson on his indie label Stoney Burke in 1993. After this Layzie and the rest of the Bone Family boarded a Greyhound Bus to Los Angeles where they worked with notable producer and rapper Eazy-E and his Ruthless/Relativity Records label. Diego Blak (born Diego Hodge), a marketer and promoter and co-executive producer of Faces Of Death introduced them to Eazy-E at a concert he promoted in Cleveland, Ohio where they auditioned for him in his dressing room and then traveled back to Los Angeles, California after the show to seal the deal. At this point Eazy named them Thugs-n-Harmony but they wanted to keep the Bone name so they were called Bone Thugs-N-Harmony.


=== Solo career, Mo Thugs & Bone Brothers ===
Layzie has also promoted the indie label Mo Thugs Records which he and the rest of Bone originated. He released his first solo album Thug By Nature on March 20, 2001, exactly the same day Bizzy Bone released his second solo album The Gift.

As of 2011, he and Fredro Starr of the Onyx group are planning to release a collaborative EP entitled FireSquad, which is set to be released late 2011. By the middle of 2013, Layzie has announced on Twitter that he is taking a step aside from performing and appearing with Bone Thugs-n-Harmony to focus on his solo-career.
