Soon after, she had her first starring role in TV Asahi drama serial Asuko March! in April.
She won the "Best Smile of the Year" award in November, and in December became the first Japanese person to be contracted with Italian luxury goods brand Gucci.On 12 December 2011, she made her debut as a singer under Universal Japan, releasing the single "Koisuru Kimochi".
