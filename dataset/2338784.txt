== Early life ==
Tremaine Aldon Neverson was born on November 28, 1984, in Petersburg, Virginia. He is the son of April (Gholson) Tucker, who was seventeen when he was born, and Claude Neverson Jr. Raised as a military brat by his mother and stepfather, Songz did not have aspirations for a musical career as a child due to his shyness, saying "Singing wasn't a reality for me, until other people started noticing I sounded good." He recognized his vocal abilities at the age of 14. Reluctant to sing, he began performing with encouragement by friends and family in high school. Record producer Troy Taylor was introduced to Songz through Songz's step-father with whom Taylor attended High School, ultimately leading to Songz signing a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 2003. After graduating from Petersburg High School in 2002, Songz moved to New Jersey to begin recording his debut album, though recording did not actually begin until 2003.


== Career ==


=== 2004–2008: I Gotta Make It and Trey Day ===

While recording his debut album in 2004, Songz released multiple mixtapes under the alias Prince of Virginia. One of the mixtapes featured an "answer track" to R. Kelly's "Trapped in the Closet", entitled "Open the Closet". The song gave Songz some notoriety.
His debut album, I Gotta Make It was released on July 26, 2005. It debuted at #20 on the Billboard 200, selling 40,000 copies in its first week of sales. It has sold 300,000 records in the US.

It garnered success in the R&B/urban community but failed to make a mark in mainstream music. The album's second and final single, "Gotta Go", was released in July 2005 and reached #67 on the Hot 100 and #11 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming even more successful than his debut single in the R&B/urban community and in the mainstream community. After promotion for his debut concluded, he was featured on the lead single from Twista's fifth album, The Day After. The single, "Girl Tonite", reached #14 on the Hot 100 and #3 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming a huge hit.
In mid-2006, Songz began work on a follow-up album to his debut with longtime collaborator Troy Taylor and also employed successful Bryan-Michael Cox, Danja, Stargate and R.

His second album was preceded by the lead single, "Wonder Woman", which was released in February 2007. It reached #54 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, but failed to impact the Hot 100. Because of the single's failure, his second album was delayed from May 2007 to October 2007. The album's second single, "Can't Help but Wait", was released in August 2007 and was released to promote his second album and the film Step Up 2 the Streets soundtrack as a single for it. The single reached #14 on the Hot 100, and #2 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It became Songz's first Top 20 hit on the Hot 100, and helped to boost his second album's sales. The single was also nominated for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance at the 2008 50th Grammy Awards. The third single from the album, "Last Time", was released in January 2008 and reached #69 on the Hot 100, and #9 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

In December 2016, following a performance at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Songz was arrested and charged with felony assault of a police officer and misdemeanor aggravated assault for injuring a photographer. It was alleged that the singer "began throwing objects after the venue cut his concert short due to an 11:30 pm curfew" and to have "struck an officer with his fist". Trey Songz pleaded guilty in August 2017 to two reduced counts of disturbing the peace, and was sentenced to 18 months of probation, substance screening and anger-management classes.On January 22, 2017, actress/singer Keke Palmer accused Songz of secretly filming her and using the footage without her permission in the music video for his remix with Fabolous of the Travis Scott and Young Thug song “Pick Up the Phone”. She also accused him of using "sexual intimidation" while recording her, and that at one point during the alleged incident she hid from him in a closet.In June 2018, Songz was sued in federal court for the incident that took place following the 2016 Detroit concert. A Detroit police officer alleges in the lawsuit that he suffered a "career-ending brain injury", and had to undergo a hip replacement when Songz allegedly punched him in the face. The officer alleged that after being hit, he and Songz fell to the floor, with the singer landing on top of the officer, causing him to hit his head on the concrete and also hurt his hip. A photographer working the show, also a party to the lawsuit, alleged that he sustained a head injury after Songz allegedly threw a microphone stand at him.A woman claimed that Songz sexually assaulted her at E11Even Miami nightclub on January 1, 2018. She later filed a lawsuit seeking damages of $10 million.
On January 24, 2021, Songz was arrested in Kansas City, Missouri, while attending the conference championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills. Songz was being heckled by fans, and he asked them to "chill out". An officer came over, and from sources and a video released by TMZ, an altercation ensued. This altercation led to Songz being arrested, and charges of trespassing, resisting arrest, both misdemeanors, and for assaulting a police officer, a felony. He was released from custody the next day. Sources connected to Songz with direct knowledge told TMZ he believes the officer in question had been biased against him long before the altercation, and when the officer approached him he was immediately aggressive. Another source says the officer's issue before the incident was that Songz and his crew were not wearing masks and refused to put them on. The Kansas City Police Department released the security video from their section, which showed that the police warned Songz and his entourage several times during multiple encounters with security and police, eventually resulting in Songz being escorted out of the seating area, at which point he threw the first punch at the police officer.On December 30, 2021, Dylan Gonzalez, a former member of University of Las Vegas' women's basketball team, tweeted, "Trey Songz Is A Rapist".
