=== Early life and education ===
Dawn Richardson was born in Pasadena, California. At the age of 13, after a friend's idea to learn a new instrument intrigued her, she broke away from playing the trombone and picked up a set of drumsticks instead. Richardson began taking lessons from Jim Volpe, a drum teacher and "local rock guy" in Southern California.Richardson earned her undergraduate degree in music, concentrating in percussion, at California State University, Los Angeles. She has studied with the principal percussionist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and with studio musicians such as Steve Houghton and Greg Goodall.

Richardson joined the band 4 Non Blondes in 1991, after the band had achieved local popularity in the San Francisco area. At the time, 4 Non Blondes had just been signed to Interscope Records. Richardson met the band through mutual friends and was asked to audition for them after the departure of their original drummer, Wanda Day.

In 1993, the band's single "What's Up?", a rock song written by lead singer Linda Perry, topped the charts, reaching No. 1 in twelve countries. However, after touring North America and Europe, the group disbanded in 1994 while in the middle of recording their second album.On May 11, 2014, Richardson and 4 Non Blondes reunited to perform at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, in a fundraiser to benefit the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Center.
