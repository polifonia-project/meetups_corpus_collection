=== Early career: 1986–1996 ===
Kodish grew up in Willesden, London. He learned to play the drums at an early age and was heavily influenced by drummers including Billy Cobham, Steve Gadd and Stewart Copeland.

In 1996, Kodish formed the jungle-surf fusion band Maximum Roach with Noko of Apollo 440 and Ian "Mary Byker" Hoxley, former lead singer of Gaye Bykers on Acid. He then joined Apollo 440 with Mary and Harry K in 1997, as their second drummer. Kodish toured extensively with Apollo 440 that year, and they were invited to support U2 in Israel.During his time with them, he appeared on two albums, Gettin' High on Your Own Supply and Dude Descending a Staircase. Two years later, after many lineup changes, Noko left Maximum Roach and was replaced by Peredur ap Gwynedd, who eventually joined Pendulum with Kodish. Noko then reunited with Maximum Roach in 2005 to record new material, which was never released. In one interview, Kodish called Maximum Roach and Apollo 440 the best bands he'd ever played in and said would die happy with those memories. Kodish is currently playing with DJ Fresh, who was introduced to Kodish by Howard Grey from Apollo 440. Kodish is currently back playing with the original Apollo 440 line up.
