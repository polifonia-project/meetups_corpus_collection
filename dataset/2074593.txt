Roger Rasmussen, better known by the stage name Nattefrost, is a Norwegian musician, best known for being the vocalist and a founding member of black metal band Carpathian Forest. He also fronts the side projects World Destroyer and Kreft, and since 2003 also has a solo project of his own.


== Biography ==
Rasmussen was born in Sandnes, Rogaland County, Norway. His first musical ventures were with the black metal band The Childmolesters, which he founded in 1990 alongside his future Carpathian Forest bandmate Johnny "Nordavind" Kr√∏vel. The band was very short-lived, ending in the same year; from its demise arose Enthrone, which changed its name to Carpathian Forest in 1992. During Carpathian Forest's first years of existence, Nattefrost used the pseudonym Lord Nosferatu; he would not be known as "Nattefrost" (Norwegian for "Night frost") until 1995, when the band released its first EP, Through Chasm, Caves and Titan Woods.
In 2000 Nattefrost formed his first side project, World Destroyer, alongside Eivind Kulde and his Carpathian Forest bandmate Daniel Vrangsinn. The band released a demo album, Diabolical Quest, in 2004; it is their only release so far. He would form the duo Kreft in 2011 alongside Patolog Falk, releasing in the same year the EP Lommemannen.
In 2003 Nattefrost announced that he would begin a solo project, and in the following year he released his first album, Blood & Vomit. His second album, Terrorist (Nekronaut, Part I), came out in the following year and counted with guest appearances by numerous musicians, such as Carl-Michael Eide, Sanrabb of Gehenna and Hoest of Taake. He also released a live EP in 2006, entitled Drunk and Pisseskev at Ringnes 2004, which was recorded during his first show, in Ringnes, and a compilation of rarities, Hell Noise and Live Terrorism, came out in 2008.
Nattefrost's latest release was the 2009 split album Engangsgrill, with Darkthrone's Fenriz's doom metal side project Fenriz's Red Planet.
In 2016 he collaborated with Urgehal, providing vocals and lyrics for the song "Endetid", off their seventh album Aeons in Sodom. He previously collaborated with Green Carnation (on Light of Day, Day of Darkness), Taake (on Hordalands doedskvad) and Aura Noir (on The Merciless).
