Christopher James Adler (born November 23, 1972) is an American musician, best known as the founder and longtime drummer of heavy metal band Lamb of God from 1994–2019, and Grammy Award winning member of Megadeth. 
Adler was a member of Megadeth from 2015–2016, playing percussion on their fifteenth album, Dystopia, and performed some touring dates in support of that album, as well as the touring and creative obligations with Lamb of God. Adler played in several local bands including Calibra, Jettison Charlie, Grouser and Darker Days before founding Lamb of God in 1994.
Adler is well recognized for his open-handed technique, his use of the heel-toe technique, and his unusual approach to the drum kit as a left handed player on a right handed kit.


== Biography ==
Adler attended Bishop Ireton High School in Alexandria, Virginia; He attended college at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia where he met former bandmates John Campbell and Mark Morton. His inspirations include former Wrathchild America and current Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin, and Stewart Copeland of The Police. Other influences are John Bonham, Dave Lombardo, Gar Samuelson, Lars Ulrich, Billy Cobham, and Gene Hoglan.According to DRUM! Magazine, Adler describes his first drum kit as a disaster:

"The bass drum legs were different lengths so they wouldn't touch the ground at the same time. Every time I would hit it, it would wobble from left to right. The cymbal stands were duct taped together, and I think after two or three times playing the kit, the pedalboard actually broke in half because it was made of that crappy old fake metal."
In 2006, Adler collaborated with revered progressive guitarist Ron Jarzombek and began the project Blotted Science. In 2013, Adler moved to Toronto, Canada to contribute to and record the album Volition with the progressive metal band Protest the Hero. The album went on to deliver Adler his first Juno Award (Canadian equivalent to the US Grammy).
In 2014, he contributed several drum tracks to the Testament album Dark Roots of Earth. On August 9, 2014 ABC News radio asked Adler in an interview if he did the drums for the new Slipknot single "The Negative One". Adler responded with "I can't confirm nor deny it". Adler later dismissed this in a later interview.

In 2016, Adler recorded three songs with Jim Gillette, Michael Angelo Batio, and Victor Wooten in a California studio for a Nitro reunion album. As of October 2017, he left the Nitro reunion project to focus on a mid-2018 release and tour with Lamb of God. 
Adler played on Megadeth's 2016 studio release Dystopia and on all live shows during the following world tour, juggling his time between Lamb of God and Megadeth. On July 1, 2016, Adler left Megadeth due to continued pressure to join full-time and leave Lamb of God. In lieu of leaving the band he started, Adler recommended his friend Dirk Verbeuren to Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine who accepted his recommendation. Verbeuren took over the throne for Megadeth at that time after agreeing to quit Soilwork as well as his other projects. 
On 12 February 2017, Adler won his first Grammy award for Dystopia which won the Best Metal Performance category at the 59th Grammy Awards. As he was no longer a band member he did not attend the ceremony with current Megadeth drummer Verbeuren attending with the band instead.
In late 2017, Adler was involved in a motorcycle accident. He revealed the details of the accident a year later in September 2018, when questions were raised about his absence from the Lamb of God tour.On July 19, 2019, following a time period of a year where Adler was not touring with the band, Adler parted ways with Lamb of God. The band eventually announced Art Cruz as his permanent replacement. Adler scheduled multiple international clinic dates in the back half of 2019 and joined a Richmond Virginia local project with the members of Kepone. In April of 2018, Adler founded Kintsugi Management, an artist management firm. Kintsugi focuses on Adler's passion for music, the artists that inspire him and employs multiple international partners.
On June 18th, 2020, Adler officially revealed his new project, Firstborne, with James LoMenzo (Megadeth, Black Label Society). Their debut track, "Anthem", along with the entire EP, released the same day on all streaming platforms, with Adler pledging to donate 100% of sales to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund during the holiday of Juneteenth.
