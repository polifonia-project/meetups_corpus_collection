"The co-owner come back and he said, My partner Trick Trick said ain’t no love for you on those bottles. I was like, your partner? Hold on. So now we’re in Trick Trick's club, I come to find out, the same club that I didn’t wanna go to and perform. Now, I’m in the club. I’m like 5’6, 150 pounds. I come out there and the whole club security surrounds me. They whooped my ass through the club, the security. My entourage was all around us and they were getting their asses whooped too!"

On some real shit back in the day when I was buying those big ass chains and shit, I felt like that was a part of me being Yung Berg. But me growing up and being Christian, being Mr. Ward, and who I really I am, I toned down. I'm not going to be with the big gaudy chains because people would look and they would say 'Well, this nigga still ain't learn his lesson.' I learned my lesson. I'm going to have jewelry but it's going to be more upscale and common. It's not going to be catching just the nigga eye.

=== Teairra Marí ===

"After I did the interview, I called Ray J and I said, 'Yo, this is what I talked about in my interview,' because I spoke candidly about our relationship and I felt my loyalty is to Ray, it's not nowhere near to Teairra. I don't even know her like that, and at the end of the day, why are we gonna go back and forth about how you tried to holla at me...you know what you did...I've got bigger things to worry about than being trivial over some pussy, especially when there's so much pussy out there. I've been called worse by better people than her". In 2014, during the first season of the VH1 show Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood, it was revealed that Ward and Marí had resolved their former issues towards each other. Later in the season, he produced her song "Deserve".
