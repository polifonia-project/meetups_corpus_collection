=== Early life and career ===
At the age of 15, Petrovic was fascinated by the worldwide dance music movement. He started DJing in the 1980s in youth clubs, schools and at parties, which he was already organising himself. By the beginning of the 1990s he had established himself in the dance scene under his nickname 'Tibby' and soon he became a popular DJ in the top club locations in Germany.
His desire to leave his definition of dance music on vinyl for posterity grew through the experience he was gaining in the clubs. The development from DJ to producer began and the income made from small gigs and part-time jobs enabled him to buy the equipment for his first own studio. In 1994, he released his first own single, under the alias Aqualoop: "Twilight Zone". The single quickly became popular in clubs. Further singles were released under this name, and other projects followed and were able to add to the success of his first release.
In 1997, the project "Pulsedriver" was born. Slobodan's object was to make music that was driving, kicking, uplifting and melodic. The first single "Rhythmic Trip" grabbed the attention of the international club and rave scene and with the follow-up releases "Time Machine" and "I'm Rushin'" the project Pulsedriver became one of the top established club acts. Bookings followed for live performances and DJing throughout Europe.
The first commercial success came with the single "Kiss That Sound" which was doing well in the dance charts and was his first entry into the German sales chart. The path of success continued to rise with the follow-up releases "I Dominate U", "Take U High" and "Your Spirit is Shining". The single "Cambodia", a cover of a Kim Wilde song, gave him his first Top 10 single in Germany, a Top 5 single in Austria and achieved chart positions in other countries in Europe. Further singles, such as "Din Daa Daa", "Time", "Move for Freedom", "Galaxy", "Vagabonds", "Slammin'", "Insane" and "Beat Bangs" as well as the albums Selected, Sequence and Night Moves all made it into the sales chart.


=== 2000-present ===
In the 2000s, Pulsedriver founded the record label Aqualoop Records in order to give his ideas and experience as a producer its own platform. The label quickly became one of the most successful dance labels in Germany. Pulsedriver was named "Best National Remixer" in the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 in succession and his remixes helped numerous acts have club successes. Currently Pulsedriver has made over 200 remixes for acts worldwide.Petriovic has had over 25 releases featured in international sales charts.
