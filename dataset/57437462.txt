They released another EP, Folly: On The Rocks on November 17, 2017. The release was composed of reimagined versions of every song on Folly, incorporating string arrangements, acoustic guitars, various percussion, and modified time signatures and tempos. A both EPs were combined together for a deluxe CD, tape and vinyl that was pressed for the release.
In March 2018, the band announced spring touring plans including two shows with The Menzingers and a short run with Boston Manor and Free Throw. On April 4, 2018, they announced that they had signed to Epitaph Records with a music video for a new song "Bad", and on May 15, 2018 they announced that their label debut full-length album, Merci, would be released on July 13 of that year.
