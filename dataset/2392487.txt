=== As performer ===

Hits from the band written and sung by Pack include certified Gold singles "Biggest Part of Me" (1980), "You're the Only Woman (You & I)" (1980) and "How Much I Feel" (1978). He co-wrote and sang lead on the band's first Top 20 hit, "Holdin' on to Yesterday" (1975). His 2005 solo album, The Secret of Movin' On, included remakes of "Biggest Part of Me" and "You're the Only Woman".
Pack guested on lead vocals on the song "Ground Zero" for Kerry Livgren's 1980 solo album, Seeds of Change. He then performed on Kansas's Vinyl Confessions album in 1982. He would later contribute guest lead vocals on the track "Shine On" off of the album It's a Jungle Out There! by Mastedon, one of two Mastedon albums written and produced by former Kansas lead singer John Elefante and his brother Dino Elefante.
During the 1980s, Pack enjoyed moderate success as a solo artist with the release of his Anywhere You Go LP in 1985.  The album generated three charting singles, the greatest of which was "I Just Can't Let Go" (US AC #13), a collaboration with Michael McDonald and James Ingram. In 1988 he recorded a duet with Bette Midler titled "I Know You by Heart", which was for the soundtrack to the film Beaches and was also featured in the movie.
He co-wrote two songs ("The Three of Me" and "I'm Talkin' to You"), sang and played guitar on Alan Parsons's 1993 album Try Anything Once, and sang and played guitar on the song "You Can Run" on Parsons' 2004 album, A Valid Path. (Ambrosia's first album was engineered by Alan Parsons, who served as producer and engineer for their second; all four members of Ambrosia played on the first Alan Parsons Project album, Tales of Mystery and Imagination.) Pack joined producer Alan Parsons on his 2001 live tribute tour to the music of the Beatles called A Walk Down Abbey Road.
