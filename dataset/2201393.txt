Bill Doss (September 12, 1968 â€“ July 30, 2012) was an American rock musician. He co-founded The Elephant 6 Recording Company in Athens, Georgia and was a key member of The Olivia Tremor Control. Following the band's break-up, he led The Sunshine Fix and later became a member of The Apples in Stereo. Doss was married to freelance photographer Amy Hairston Doss, whom he met while both were attending Louisiana Tech University.


== Early career ==
Doss was a native of Dubach, Louisiana, where he met Will Cullen Hart, Robert Schneider and Jeff Mangum, his friends at nearby Ruston High School. Before the Olivia Tremor Control Doss had recorded under the name The Sunshine Fix, and self-released A Spiraling World of Pop, which later helped comprise The Olivia Tremor Control songs. Before the Olivia Tremor Control, Doss had spent some time in the army, after which he joined New York based band Chocolate USA before returning to Athens, Georgia, where he was a resident at the time of his death.

Doss, Hart and Mangum soon formed what was later to become the Olivia Tremor Control.   After Mangum left the band to pursue his own Neutral Milk Hotel, Hart and Doss began to pool their musical influences, Hart being a proponent of experimentalism, Doss of 60's pop such as The Beatles, the Beach Boys and The Zombies. After the release of the second The Olivia Tremor Control album, Black Foliage, the band broke up in 2000.

Doss went on to restart The Sunshine Fix. That band's first full-length album, Age of the Sun, was released in 2002. In 2004, TSF released the less well received Green Imagination (which featured artwork and videos by Kevin Evans). Doss began touring with The Apples in Stereo in early 2006, playing keyboards. He appeared on the Apples' 2007 album New Magnetic Wonder, was listed as a full-fledged band member on the band's 2010 album Travellers in Space and Time, and contributed to the songwriting on both albums. At the time of his death, Doss was producing albums in his own studio in Athens.
