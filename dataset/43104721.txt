=== Early life ===
Baird was born in Seattle, Washington. He was introduced to music at an early age by his father, a trumpet player who played in rock bands and doubled on an eclectic collection of instruments, including saxophone, flute, Rhodes, synthesizer and percussion. His family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1996. He began to play the saxophone around age ten, eventually studied jazz and improvisation for several years with saxophonist Alan Braufman.During his teenage years, Baird became highly influenced by the music of saxophonist Michael Brecker. A chance encounter with drummer Jeff Hamilton inspired Baird to try to connect with Brecker directly for music lessons. After making contact via Brecker's manager, Brecker agreed to meet in person next time he traveled through Salt Lake City in early 2003.  Although brief, Baird cites Brecker's mentorship around this time as influential on the trajectory of his career.In 2004, Baird's family relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area.
