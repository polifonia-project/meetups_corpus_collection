== Early life ==

== Career ==
His debut album Young & Thuggin' became a Top 10 hit on the Billboard 200. After the split of the Hot Boys in 2001 and his departure from Cash Money in 2003, he signed a deal with producer Ke'Noe at Laboratory Recordz and released two albums Raw & Uncut and Penitentiary Chances. In 2005, Turk was convicted on federal charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm, a fugitive from justice in possession of a firearm, and an unlawful user addicted to a controlled substance in possession of a firearm. The charges arose from the shooting of a Memphis, Tennessee police officer in early 2004. He was sentenced to 10 years of incarceration. In 2006, he entered an Alford plea in Tennessee state court to second-degree attempted murder, based on the same incident, and was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment.While incarcerated Ke'Noe released two albums of unreleased Turk verses called Still A Hot Boy and Convicted Felons. The albums profits of the last two releases were put on Turk's prison books. Turk was released from prison in October 2012 after almost nine years of incarceration. In December 2012, Turk made a hit single titled "Zip It" featuring Lil Wayne. Weeks later, a remix with Juvenile was made and released. In February 2013, a version with Turk, Lil Wayne, Juvenile and B.G. was made, making an  official Hot Boys reunion song. Turk released a mixtape under SoundCloud called "Blame It On The System".


== Legal issues ==
On January 26, 2004 at around 2:00pm local time, dozens of Shelby County Narcotics Officers and SWAT officers served a search warrant for drugs believed to be inside Turk's apartment in the Hickory Pointe Community in Southeast Memphis. After knocking on the door and identifying themselves led to no response, the officers entered and began searching the apartment. Turk then allegedly shot at them with a 9mm handgun. The officers and SWAT returned fire, engaging in a 15-minute shootout with Turk. Turk finally surrendered to Shelby County officers and the SWAT Team. Turk was charged Wednesday, January 28, 2004 with first-degree attempted murder for allegedly shooting two Memphis, Tennessee Police Officers.In February 2015, Turk filed lawsuit against Cash Money Records for $1.3 million, over unpaid royalties for recordings dating back to 1999, including solo work from his debut Young & Thuggin' and group, the Hot Boys. The rapper eventually won the suit by default, when Cash Money failed to respond. However, in June 2015, Turk requested that the lawsuit be dismissed after both parties reached an amicable settlement.
