== Early years ==
Prior to forming the successful Kingdom Come, Lenny had moved from Germany to Los Angeles in 1983 signing with MCA Records with a band called Stone Fury. Along with Bruce Gowdy Stone Fury released two critically acclaimed records in 1984 and 1986, but struggled to attract mainstream attention.

In 1988, Lenny signed a new deal with Polygram and per their request, was asked to put a new band together. It consisted of: lead guitarist Danny Stag, rhythm guitar Rick Steier, bassist Johnny B. Frank, and drummer James Kottak. The band saw immediate success with the release of their eponymous debut album Kingdom Come, shooting to number 12 on the Billboard 200 and reaching sales at approximately 2 million worldwide. The band was also chosen to participate in the Monsters of Rock Tour 1988.The band came under intense criticism for being a Led Zeppelin-soundalike. Years later, Wolf would say that the comparisons were "unjustified," yet "we took it as a compliment and were excited."In March 2018, it was reported that Wolf was in the process of reforming the original Kingdom Come lineup for both a new album and tour. However, when original lineup of Kingdom Come announced a 30th anniversary reunion tour in June 2018, Wolf declined to participate, due to personal reasons, and was replaced by Keith St John. In a July 2018 interview, drummer James Kottak revealed that Wolf is "just kind of done. He wants to retire. He's got his life."
