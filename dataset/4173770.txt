Googe was born in Yeovil, Somerset, England. Prior to joining My Bloody Valentine, she played for a band called Bikini Mutants in her hometown of Yeovil, who gigged with The Mob. Googe had moved from Yeovil to London, and in early 1985, an ex-girlfriend of hers recommended her as a bass player to Kevin Shields and Colm Ó Cíosóig of My Bloody Valentine. She joined the band after an audition in April 1985. She left the group in 1996, noting she "hadn't been happy for a long time".Googe is known for her raucous style of bass playing in MBV's live performances.
Googe joined My Bloody Valentine's 2007 reunion, and their subsequent tours.

After leaving MBV in 1995, Googe briefly became a taxi driver. She formed Snowpony in 1996 with her then-girlfriend, Katharine Gifford, formerly of Stereolab. They released three albums and four EPs between 1997 and 2003.
She occasionally plays keyboards with the massed fuzz organ experimentalists band Pimmel and also plays drums and sings backing vocals for Rockhard.
In 2012 it was announced that Googe would be the new bassist for Primal Scream, replacing Mani after his departure to rejoin The Stone Roses. She was subsequently succeeded by Simone Butler.
On 4 August 2014, Googe joined Thurston Moore for his solo project The Best Day, and continued this collaboration with his subsequent album Rock n Roll Consciousness in 2017, alongside Steve Shelley, and the UK musician James Sedwards.
