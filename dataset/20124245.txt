== Controversy ==
In February 2011 Austin had the logo of a local record label tattooed on his face after a conversation with the label's CEO Big Bank Black. Black's brother Alley Boy, the label's co-CEO, demanded that Austin remove the tattoo because he wasn't signed to the label and wasn't given permission to use the logo. Austin countered that Alley Boy lacked the authority to make such a demand because Big Bank Black, not Alley Boy, was "the real CEO" of the label. He did though have a Los Angeles Dodgers logo tattooed over it two weeks later. Austin was set up and viciously assaulted by Alley Boy and members of his label; whether he was beaten before covering the tattoo or after wasn't known.In April 2011, Austin was arrested for criminal damage to property and released on bail.
