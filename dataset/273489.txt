== Early life and education ==
Selway was born on 23 May 1967 in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. He started learning to play drums and guitar at the age of 15 for "the social cachet and love of music"; his earliest influences were Joy Division, the Clash and the Velvet Underground.The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon. Selway, along with guitarist Ed O'Brien, was in the year above singer Thom Yorke and bassist Colin Greenwood, and three years above multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, brother of Colin. In 1985, they formed On a Friday, the name referring to the band's usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. Selway attended Liverpool Polytechnic, where he studied literature. He also worked as an English teacher and copyeditor.


== Career ==


=== Radiohead ===

In 1991, On a Friday signed a six-album recording contract with EMI and changed their name to Radiohead. They found early success with their 1992 single "Creep". Their third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to international fame and is often acclaimed as one of the best albums of all time.From their fourth album, Kid A (2000), Radiohead began integrating drum machines and electronic percussion into their music. Selway said this "pushed me to create some new dynamics. It’s another way of solving the problem of arranging songs ... Electronics opened up my drumming rather than closing down the possibilities of what I can do. Now I can express myself in a more effective way."Since 2011, Radiohead have performed with a second drummer, Clive Deamer. Describing their 2012 tour for The King of Limbs, Selway said: "One [of us] played in the traditional way, the other almost mimicked a drum machine. It was push-and-pull, like kids at play, really interesting."In 2008, Gigwise named Selway the 26th greatest drummer of all time, praising his "mathematical precision". By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2019.

Selway began writing songs as a teenager, but concentrated on drumming after forming Radiohead. Later in life, he began developing songs again. Feeling they had a "distinct character" and "very much my personality" that did not fit with Radiohead, Selway began recording solo material. His debut solo album, Familial, was released on 30 August 2010. It features Selway on guitar and vocals, with Wilco members Glenn Kotche and Pat Sansone as well as fellow 7 Worlds Collide artists Lisa Germano and Sebastian Steinberg.
