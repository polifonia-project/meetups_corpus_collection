== Early years ==
Richard Lofthouse Butler was born on 5 June 1956 in Kingston upon Thames, southwest London, England. His father, George Butler, was a research chemist, a communist and an atheist. In the 1970s, George Butler was slated to become a scientific ambassador to the Soviet Union but a friend convinced him this would not be a good place for his family. Butler's mother was an artist. Butler started art school in London with the idea of becoming a painter. After graduation, he worked in a silk-screen print shop but got the idea to form a band.


== Musical career ==
Butler formed the Psychedelic Furs in 1977 with his bassist brother Tim Butler. According to Butler, the Psychedelic Furs began rehearsing in the Butlers' front room, but were soon banished because of the noise. Joined by guitarist John Ashton, guitarist Roger Morris, drummer Vince Ely and saxophonist Duncan Kilburn, the band quickly gained commercial success.
The Psychedelic Furs went on hiatus in the early 1990s and Butler became the founder and lead singer of Love Spit Love. By 2000 he stated that Love Spit Love had "gone into remission." His work with Love Spit Love can be heard on the hit syndicated television show Charmed. A truncated version of LSL's cover version of the Smiths' hit song "How Soon Is Now?" – recorded for The Craft soundtrack – plays during the Charmed opening credits. He also sang backing vocals, on "I Am Anastasia" by the American band Sponge. Love Spit Love's "Am I Wrong" was the theme over the opening credits of the 1995 film Angus.
In 2001, the Psychedelic Furs reformed after a nine-year hiatus and have toured worldwide since then.
In early 2006, Butler released the eponymous solo album titled Richard Butler, a collection of songs dedicated to his late father, George Butler, and also Jon Carin's father, Arthur A. Carin (Carin was Richard Butler's collaborator on the release, co-authoring and arranging much of the music). In 2014, Butler covered Charles Aznavour's "She" for the Gone Girl teaser trailer.


== Art career ==
In the early 2000s, Butler became interested in the art scene and began painting again. He has had gallery exhibitions in New York City, Miami (Waltman Ortega Fine Art), and Florence, Italy. One of his works, Girl With a Map, has been used as a CD's cover art.


== Personal life ==
Richard Butler has one daughter, Maggie Mozart Butler (b. September 1997). In September 2020 Butler married model and actress Erika Anderson known from A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child and Zandalee.
