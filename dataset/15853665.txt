Pablo Flores is a Puerto Rican DJ, record producer, remixer and arranger; known for being the world's premier Latin remixer and DJ.


== Biography ==
At the age of 16, Pablo Flores was already putting his love of pop music to work managing San Juan, Puerto Rico's top record store and eventually, at 19, opening his own music store "El Discobolo". Even though it carried a wide variety of music genres, “El Discobolo” specialized in dance music, catering to club DJs.
Flores' expertise in dance music then led to a 17-year career as Latin America's top club DJ, spinning records at San Juan's legendary Bachelor discothèque. There, he created exclusive versions of current songs, transforming romantic Latin ballads into high energy dance floor hits by blending Latin, European and American rhythms,
into his own unique sound.
In 1984, Flores' distinctive mixing style caught the attention of Miami Sound Machine's Emilio and Gloria Estefan, at the time preparing their first English-language record. After visiting Bachelor and hearing Flores' up-tempo version of one of their ballads, they asked him to remix the first single, “Dr. Beat”, from their forthcoming album, their first in English. Topping the dance charts in the U.S. and Europe, that remix of “Dr. Beat” paved the way for Gloria Estefan's signature hit “Conga”. Flores' remix of “Conga” was the version released as the single and album track, catapulting her  career as the top Latin crossover artist in the last 30 years, and establishing Flores' reputation as a hit making remixer. Since then, Pablo has produced over 30 remixes for Estefan.
In 1996 Ricky Martin was well known in Latin America but it was Flores' and longtime friend and collaborator Javier Garza's remixed version of “Maria”, that exploded worldwide, selling millions of copies and establishing Ricky's crossover success. Because of the impact of that remix, with its fusion of Brazilian and Afro-Latin percussion, Ricky was asked to create a theme for the 1998 World Cup, and so the mega-hit “The Cup of Life” was created, with many of the melodic and percussive elements of the “Maria” remix. Flores' remix of “The Cup of Life” was one of 1998's biggest selling records. Pablo has made a total of 14 remixes for Ricky Martin.
Madonna also sought out Flores' unique sound for her singles “Don’t Cry for Me Argentina” and “Buenos Aires” from her film Evita. The only commissioned remix of that song, Flores' version of “Don’t Cry...” sold millions and generated pop radio's interest in playing the song.
Another notable example of Flores' versatility and knack for creating pop hits is Colombian superstar Shakira. In addition to producing five important remixes for Shakira, Flores delved into the world of songwriting and co-wrote and co-produced her smash hit “Ojos Asi”, the Arab influenced rock / dance tune that not only jump- started her international success, but earned her a 2000 Grammy. More than any other song from her extensive catalog, “Ojos Asi” is featured on five different Shakira albums, including an English language version, “Eyes Like Yours”, on the multi-platinum Laundry Service.
Flores' remix of Jennifer Lopez's first single “If You Had My Love” was featured in the video of that song, earning her a Best Dance Video Grammy nomination. He has remixed five tracks for Lopez, and received a Grammy nomination for mixing her signature song "Let's Get Loud".
Another part of Flores' multi-faceted career was his three years (1987-1990) as an exclusive remixer for popular Puerto Rican radio station, KQ-105, and in 1989 as resident DJ on the hit Puerto Rican TV show, Party Time.
In 2011, Flores collaborated again with Estefan. “Miss Little Havana”, Estefan's first release in English in eight years, produced “Wepa”, and the second single “Hotel Nacional” both of which reached the #1 spot on Billboard's Dance Charts. 
His most recent remix work is "This is Our Love" for new Miami based singer Sophi, and the anthem "I'm Free" for Angelique Van Hamersveld.
From 2011 to 2015, Pablo returned to his DJ and Radio roots, with a popular mix show on Puerto Rico radio station Magic 97.3.
On August 17, 2013 Pablo presented a tribute event, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, for the Bachelor disco called "Bachelor Forever 2013" where he performed as a DJ for the first time in over 20 years. That event was the most successful 2013 Dance event in Puerto Rico, with over 3,500 people attending.
On January 28, 2017, Pablo, together with his partner Norberto "Junior" Molina, opened their own internet radio station named BPM Dance Radio, specializing in 70's, 80's and 90's Dance Music. This successful station features mixshows by Puerto Rico's top DJs, in addition to Pablo's own weekly mixshow "The Art of the Mix"
