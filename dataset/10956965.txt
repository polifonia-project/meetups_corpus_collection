Johan Lorbeer is a German artist concerned with phenomena of perception. He best known for levitating in the air, with an arm touching the surface of a building.


== Life and career ==
Lorbeer started developing this act in the 1970s. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Nuremberg.
His installations include "Working Class Hero" and "Tarzan Standing Leg". Several of these performances feature Lorbeer in an apparently impossible position such as a street cleaner standing horizontally out from a wall high above the street, or standing in mid-air 'leaning' against a wall with one hand in Cairo, Egypt in November 2008.
