Gregory Keltgen (born 1979), better known by his stage name DJ Abilities, is a Minnesota-based underground hip hop producer and DJ signed to Rhymesayers Entertainment. He is a founding member of Eyedea & Abilities alongside the late rapper Eyedea and also Semi.Official alongside rapper I Self Devine. Abilities is a member of 1200 Hobos and was also a member of Atmosphere at one point.
DJ Abilities is well known in the Midwest for being one of the best battle DJs in the local scene, having won both the 1999 and 2001 DMC Regional championships. However, he and Eyedea were noted, above all, for their ability to interact in live on stage performances, as well as on record.


== Career ==
DJ Abilities released First Born, a debut album with the rapper Eyedea as Eyedea & Abilities, in 2001. He handled the turntable work on El-P's 2002 solo debut album Fantastic Damage. Two more collaborative albums with Eyedea, E&A (2004) and By the Throat (2009), were both released on Rhymesayers Entertainment.
Eyedea & Abilities has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star "might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis," according to journalist Steve Marsh.
