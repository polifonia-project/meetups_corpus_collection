== Musical career ==
Her first 45 single was written and produced by Sylvester Stewart, better known as Sly Stone : "Gospel Singer Gloria Scott and the Tonettes cut I Taught Him with Sly in 1964. Reminiscent of girl groups like Martha and the Vandellas, The Shirelles and The Ronettes, Warner Brothers picked up this single for distribution." In an interview with Christian John Wikane of Popmatters, Scott says : "He [Sly] just kind of took me under his wing. I sang at the Cow Palace. Sly and his sister and his cousin LaTanya backed me up and they were called the Tonettes: Gloria Scott and the Tonettes."She then became a member of The Ikettes. Tina Turner says in her autobiography: "After [previous Ikettes] Robbie, Jessie and Venetta walked out, Ike had quickly scooped up two inexperienced L.A. girls, Maxine Smith and Pat 'P.P.' Arnold, and a young club singer from Palo Alto named Gloria Scott.".She later met and signed a 7-year contract with Barry White. White produced and arranged her only album, What Am I Gonna Do, which was released in 1974. Two tracks were released as singles. The album is notable for being the second released by Casablanca Records—label number NB0002 (NB0001 was by KISS). At that time Warner Brothers distributed the album, in multiple countries.
Roshad Ollison, writing in the Virginia Pilot, says "What Am I Gonna Do is among Barry's most pop-minded productions. Gloria's lone release, it is also a gem. … What Am I Gonna Do, a classy effort on par with Barry's best albums, soon faded away; Gloria did, too."Her single "Just as Long as We're Together (In My Life There Will Never Be Another)" was also produced by Barry White. This song peaked at #14 on the Hot Dance charts, #16 on Billboard (Feb 22, 1975) Hot Soul Singles  and on the U.S. R&B. It was played on the famous TV show Soul Train.Despite her 7-year contract with Barry White, and (indirectly) with Casablanca, her career failed to take off. PopMatters comments : "However, a combination of factors, including the growing pains of a new record company and White's focus on his own burgeoning career, ultimately limited the reach of What Am I Gonna Do. Though a follow-up single, 'Just As Long as We're Together', hit the R&B Top 20 and held the top spot on the Disco Singles chart in early-1975, the second album she recorded with arranger H. B. Barnum was not released. For all his solo success, Barry White was not delivering on his contract with Gloria Scott. He became one of the most seminal figures of the 1970s while Scott faded into obscurity."She is credited as a backup singer on the 1979 self-titled album by Mary Wilson (of the Supremes), and in the late 1970s and early 1980s, also toured with Mary and fellow background singer, Karen Jackson.
Scott has performed every year since 2008 at The Baltic Soul Weekender in Germany. Her performance of Help Me Get Off This Merry-Go-Round, with the Baltic Soul Orchestra, was released as a single.

John Connolly in Nocturnes writes: "Jerry passed through the main gates to the Benson farm, instinctively turning down the truck radio, since Bruce didn't appreciate music much, and certainly not the stuff that was pouring out of Jerry's speakers just now: Gloria Scott's sultry vocals, backed up by the late, great Barry White's production skills."
