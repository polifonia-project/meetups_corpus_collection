Wolfgang Flür (born 17 July 1947) is a German musician, best known for playing percussion in the electronic group Kraftwerk from 1973 to 1987. Flür claims that he invented the electric drums the group used throughout the 1970s.  However, patent records dispute this, citing Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter as the creators.


== Background ==
In the 1960s, Flür played an acoustic drum kit in the Düsseldorf band The Spirits of Sound, along with guitarist Michael Rother, who would also go on to play in Kraftwerk, and who would later form Neu! with Kraftwerk drummer Klaus Dinger.


== Post-Kraftwerk ==
In 1997, Flür founded the band Yamo and released the album Time Pie, a collaboration with Mouse on Mars. Yamo's next release, the 12" I Was a Robot, reached number 6 in the German club charts. Collaborations with Pizzicato Five and Der Plan founding member Pyrolator were announced, and the lyrics to a song called "Greed" appeared in Flür's autobiography, but this material remains unreleased.
In 2000, Flür published his autobiography, Ich war ein Roboter (English version: I Was a Robot). The book covers his youth, early career as a musician, sexual escapades, and some of his activity within Kraftwerk.  Hütter and Schneider filed a lawsuit against Flür, causing a temporary halt of the publication and revision of parts that included disputed accounts of his time with the band.
Recently, Flür has been seen DJing in clubs, playing tech house and electro. He has also played electronic percussion with the German synthpop band Dyko in live shows and on their 2009 cover of Kraftwerk's "Autobahn".  He has also performed under the moniker "Musik Soldat".
Japanese singer Maki Nomiya's 2005 album Party People included the song "Yamate Line," with songwriting and co-production credited to Flür/Yamo.
On 16 October 2015, Flür released his first solo album under his own name, entitled Eloquence.Flür announced three new collaboration albums, the first of which, "Magazine 1", to be released in February 2022. 
On 4 September 2020, Flür collaborated with German dance act U96 to release Transhuman, it featured 3 new songs from Flür, the only songs he's released in 5 years.
On 12 May 2021, Kraftwerk was announced as one of the inductees of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Flür being one of the inductees along with Schneider, Hütter and Karl Bartos.
