d'Ecco played in bands for a number of years without seeing much progress. Eventually his father offered to put him up at the family home in the Gulf Islands where he would care for his grandmother, then ailing with Alzheimer's disease. It was during this time of retreat that he wrote the songs that would make up his solo debut as Art d'Ecco, Day Fevers. d'Ecco recorded this album solo with a piano and an iPhone.After releasing and touring with Day Fevers, d'Ecco began to experiment with his image, inspired by his fascination with artists that "look weird", citing Iggy Pop and Deerhunter. By the time he released his second album, 2018's Trespasser, his first release with Paper Bag Records, he had arrived at his signature look of bob wig and androgynous makeup. His promotion for the album included a set at the 2019 Bumbershoot festival.In 2021 d'Ecco released his third album, In Standard Definition, which was recorded in analog on a 50-year-old console. It has been described as "a concept album about entertainment." As a follow-up d'Ecco released a cover single of The Jam's "That's Entertainment".
