== Career ==


=== Soil (1997–2004) ===
McCombs was discovered by Soil through a compilation CD of unsigned bands. He joined the band as lead vocalist in mid-1997. Soil released three albums (Throttle Junkies, Scars and Redefine) and two EPs (Soil and El Chupacabra) during his time in the group. With heavy anthems like "Halo" and "Unreal", the band gained commercial recognition and international status with their second album, Scars, in 2001. Their 2004 follow-up would continue Soil's significant exposure. While touring for their latest album, McCombs suddenly decided to leave the band, which caused the cancelation of many scheduled performances alongside acts like Sevendust and Damageplan.


=== Drowning Pool (2005–2011) ===
After his departure, McCombs took a one-year hiatus from the music business. By the time he returned to music, Soil had already found a new lead singer, A.J. Cavalier.  Around this time, Drowning Pool's second singer, Jason Jones, left to join A.M. Conspiracy. Amidst rumors spreading about who would be Drowning Pool's next singer, the band confirmed the new vocalist's identity at Ozzfest in Dallas, Texas on August 25, 2005 to be McCombs.The first Drowning Pool song released with McCombs as the singer was a remake of their song "Rise Up", originally performed with Jason Jones as lead singer. The song was titled "Rise Up 2006" and featured as a bonus downloadable track on WWE Wreckless Intent, and was the theme for WWE SmackDown until 2008. The soundtrack to the film Saw III contains a demo version of "No More", the second track released with McCombs on vocals. Drowning Pool recorded their third studio album, Full Circle, released on August 7, 2007. It featured the hit single "37 Stitches". "Shame", which was released as the album's last single, was featured in the Saw IV soundtrack.

In 2010, the band released their fourth album, Drowning Pool. It once again features McCombs as vocalist, thus being the first Drowning Pool album not to feature a new lead singer.
In November 2011, it was announced that McCombs and Drowning Pool would be parting ways, and that he would once again be the permanent vocalist for Soil.


=== Return to Soil (2011–present) ===
In 2011, McCombs rejoined Soil. The band played various venues throughout the UK including Download Festival at which it played a live acoustic set for the first time. The band released their new album Whole on August 16, 2013 (worldwide) and August 20, 2013 (North America).


== Personal life ==
McCombs is divorced and has three children. He married his second wife in 2017. He suffered a stroke in 2014 a couple of days after playing at The Bierkeller in Bristol.
