== Early life ==
Maeson was raised in Norfolk, Virginia. His parents were juvenile delinquents who later became "musicianaries", eventually playing in Christian metal bands. He was banned from listening to secular rock music on the radio until he was a teen. Matt has never served time in prison. He did community service by working construction for 12 hours a day and performed at biker rallies and prisons with his parents' ministry.
