== Biography ==
After putting years of energy into the Birmingham hip hop scene, Juice's "Ghetto Grammer" freestyle rap sessions started featuring such other future stars as Ty, Skinnyman and MPHO. In 1996 Will Ashon started up his new Ninja Tune-backed label Big Dada and planned a roster of performers. Bandit of Birmingham's MSI/Asylum crew told Ashon about Aleem. Ashon was impressed with the music and agrees to have Aleem on board. This resulted in the first release of the now iconic record label.In 1997 Juice featured on Big Dada's first ever release, Misanthropic, under the pseudonym "Alpha Prhyme", a collaboration between himself and Luke Vibert.
As a regular compere and host for Ninja Tune and their events, Aleem ended up working with the veterans of the label, Coldcut, and touring with them around Russia, China, New Zealand, Luxembourg, Korea, Japan,
Thailand and Ukraine.
