== Style ==
Draksler's music has been described as being "in the border area and in the intersection of jazz, free improvised music, classical modernism and new music". It contains some elements of folk music of the Balkans and Slovenia, functioning "in the sense of an imaginary folklore". Draksler has been heavily influenced by Cecil Taylor; whom she wrote a dissertation on.
