== Early life ==
Started playing the violin under the Suzuki method when she was 3 years old. During her teenage years, she 'quit' violin and started playing the guitar to "learn all the Hendrix solos". After realizing her facility with the instrument, she picked up the violin once again during her university years. She says that her time away from the classical rigmarole, helped her take a more relaxed approach when collaborating with others. During her time in her university she formed Bell Orchestre, a group influenced by the likes of Steve Reich, Penguin Cafe Orchestra and Tortoise. Eventually, her playing with Bell Orchestre led to an invitation for her to play with the band Arcade Fire.

Neufeld was a core member of the band on its second and third studio albums, Neon Bible (2007) and The Suburbs (2010), and contributed as an additional musician on the albums Funeral (2004), Reflektor (2013) and Everything Now (2017) and their subsequent tours.
