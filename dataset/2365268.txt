== Career ==


=== Actress and model ===
Lie started out as a pornographic actress. She starred in 10 porn films between 2002 and 2003, but then decided to end her porn-industry career and switch to mainstream modeling. She competed in the Miss Norway pageant in 2004, but was disqualified from the contest when it was found she had starred in adult films; candidates to the pageant must not have been pictured naked in any commercial production or publication. Her adult film career has made her the target of much criticism and prevented her from visiting her father in Iran.
In a July 2010 interview, Lie stated that she "sorely regrets" having engaged in pornographic acting. She explained that the choice was made while she was going through a difficult time of her life, and she wished she could "erase that from [her] past". She also denied that she was banned from entering her native Iran because of her pornographic background.Her plans for 2006 included the promotion of her hand-picked team of models, called Team Aylar. The members of Team Aylar originally included Elita Löfblad, Charlotte Fredriksen, Linn Irene (Linni) Meister, Cathrine Aschim, and Lisa Marie Winther.


=== Appearances ===
In 2010, Lie participated in the 6th season of Skal vi danse?, the Norwegian version of the British series Strictly Come Dancing. When Danish media ran a headline focusing on her past as a porn actress she expressed sadness and strong distress and that she was tired of being linked to events ten years in her past, although she acknowledged she may have to live with this part of her life being repeatedly brought to the surface. She pointed out that what took place in Los Angeles happened during a period of crisis in her personal life and that she has repeatedly attempted to clean the slate with regard to this.She was signed to Hard2Beat, after which she released the single "Some People", which features Ocean Drive and DJ Oriska.
