== Biography ==
The son of Guyanese American jazz saxophonist Jimmy Cozier, and Dawn Cozier, a Jamaican born hair stylist. Cozier and his younger brother Malik were raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Cozier was encouraged to sing as a child by his family, who would demand that he perform in group settings. He started out as a singer/songwriter for artists such as Mýa, Sinéad O'Connor, and Janet Jackson (whose hit "Girlfriend/Boyfriend" he co-wrote). He was a background vocalist for the Junior Mafia/Lil' Kim track "Backstabbers" and toured with Joe behind the latter's album All That I Am.
Wyclef Jean caught word of Cozier's talent thru Cozier manager Jacques “Haitian Jack” Agnant and had him meet with Clive Davis, who signed Cozier to J Records in 2000. His debut single "She's All I Got" was released in 2001, and rose to #26 on the Billboard Hot 100 and to #4 on the R&B chart.Following the success of the single, his self-titled debut album was released on July 9, 2001 and hit the Billboard Top 200 at #65 and #15 on the R&B Albums chart.

In 2007, he announced work on a new album, releasing two singles, "U Got Them Goods" and "You", that year. Continued work on his sophomore album stretched through 2010.
