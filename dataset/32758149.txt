== Controversies ==
Seven was under investigation for allegedly visiting a massage parlor, famous for prostitution, whilst on military duty on June 22, 2013, alongside Sangchu of Mighty Mouth. It was decided that they broke curfew trying to get massages. They allegedly visited several parlors that were closed before they found one that was open late. They left as soon as they realised that it was a parlor for prostitution. Both received ten days in military jail for their actions. At the same time, five other celebrity recruits were sentenced to four days in military jail for possessing cellphones, and one was sentenced to 10 days' probation for leaving to watch a movie after hours. The incident caused a severe backlash, and led the Ministry of Defense to abolish the Celebrity Soldier unit.
