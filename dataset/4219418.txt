Cyndi Grecco (born May 19, 1952) is an American singer best-known for performing the theme tune to the popular 1970s American television show Laverne & Shirley.
The theme to Laverne & Shirley was titled "Making Our Dreams Come True," in which Grecco was accompanied by The Ron Hicklin Singers. It was also put out as a single and charted, peaking at no. 25 in the Billboard Hot 100 of July 4, 1976. The song came out on the small Private Stock Records label (#45086). Grecco was managed by Janna Feliciano, then-wife of Jos√© Feliciano, and was a featured performer at the 1977 Sun Bowl.An album followed, though a second disco-themed single, "Dancing, Dancing", failed to chart. Grecco also provided the theme to another 1970s ABC television sitcom, Blansky's Beauties. Nevertheless, Grecco remains a one-hit wonder.
