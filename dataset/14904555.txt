== Career ==
At the age of 16, while spending a weekend in New York City with her mother, Wynn's singing came to the attention of a retired producer who was  a guest at the same place. He booked Wynn at a Peekskill vaudeville house, the owner of which engaged her to sing at his two other New York State properties, in Kingston and Newburgh. After working the vaudeville circuit, the late 1930s saw Wynn landing at radio station WNEW in New York for a 13-show-per-week stint and honing her talent under the mentorship of Jimmy Rich, the singing coach to Dinah Shore, Bea Wain, and Barry Wood, among others.Radio show stints followed with Rudy Vallee's orchestra, and with Hal Kemp's orchestra on his "Time to Shine" radio show. Having earned the moniker "molten mama with the lava larynx", she caught the eye of a Warner Bros. movie scout while singing at The Pump Room in Chicago, leading to a role in Million Dollar Baby (1941).Wynn is perhaps best known for dubbing Rita Hayworth's singing voice in several films, including The Strawberry Blonde (1941), My Gal Sal (1942), and You Were Never Lovelier (1942),In the late 1940s, she appeared on the Morey Amsterdam and Ed Sullivan shows. Wynn's career was cut short abruptly in 1949 by the loss of her voice following the surgical removal of a cancerous tumor, which resulted in a severed facial nerve. Refusing to accept the medical prognosis that a recovery was not possible, Wynn regained her speech and facial control by 1955, at which point she was briefly signed to RCA Victor.
