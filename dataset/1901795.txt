László "Leslie" Mándoki (born 7 January 1953) is a German-Hungarian musician who became known as a member of the music group Dschinghis Khan. He continued his career as a solo artist and became a music producer who worked with many internationally famous artists.


== Early life ==
Mándoki studied drums and percussion at the musical conservatory of Budapest in the early 1970s. At the same time he was a band leader for the local jazz-rock group JAM, citing groups like Cream and Jethro Tull as his influence.
In July 1975, Mándoki, along with Gábor Csupó (the creator of Rugrats) and others, fled from Hungary to Munich, West Germany to avoid prosecution by the communist regime for being a member of the student opposition. He had been imprisoned 17 times for his political opposition before he fled into the West.

Dschinghis Khan, where Mandoki was one of the six members, was the German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 1979, finishing on 4th place. Mandoki performed on 15 episodes of the music show "ZDF Hitparade" with Dschinghis Khan between 1979 and 1982. Mandoki stated in later interviews that he was glad about his time with Dschingis Khan, although he felt unsure at the time about being in the group as he felt more at home with rock music. He has not taken part in the reunion of Dschingis Khan since 2015.
