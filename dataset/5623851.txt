Denys B. Cowan (born January 30, 1961) is an American comics artist, television producer, media executive and one of the co-founders of Milestone Media.


== Early life ==
Denys Cowan was first inspired by superheroes as a child from reruns of the 1950s TV show Adventures of Superman with George Reeves. He did not yet know what a comic book was, and would not learn about them until the third grade. After Cowan's mother died, he moved in with his grandparents, and attended school in that district, where he met a future fellow comics creator, Derek Dingle, who drew comics with his brother. Dingle showed Cowan his first comic book, an issue of Jack Kirby's New Gods. Cowan attended the High School of Art and Design in New York City. One day in the school lunchroom, the 14-year-old Cowan met someone who worked for artist and Deathlok creator Rich Buckler. This led Cowan to pay a visit one day after school to Buckler's studio, where Buckler hired Cowan as his assistant. For a year, Cowan performed a number of tasks, including running errands, cleaning the studio, looking up references, for which Buckler paid him in the music albums that he had played in his studio, which increased Cowan's appreciation for music.


== Career ==
Cowan's first published comics work was a three-page story in Weird War Tales #93 (Nov. 1980) for DC Comics. He was one of the contributors to the DC Challenge limited series in 1986.

Cowan was the penciller on the latter half of the 1990 Deathlok miniseries, published by Marvel Comics, which was written by Dwayne McDuffie and Gregory Wright as well as on the subsequent regular title of the same name.
Cowan and writer Dwayne McDuffie collaborated on a Prince comic book in 1991. Cowan co-founded  Milestone Media in 1993 with McDuffie, Michael Davis, and Derek Dingle, and later worked as a producer on the animated series Static Shock, based on the Milestone character.As Senior Vice President of Animation at BET, Cowan was responsible for the creation, development and production of animated programming for the entire network.
