Ostrander later became the front man of Eastern Conference Champions (ECC), which he started with his friend and collaborator Greg Lyons from Laguardia and Vern Zaborowski from CKY. The band also included Melissa Dougherty. The band came about when Ostrander and Lyons signed with Geffen Records and released the EP called The Southampton Collection under the ECC moniker.

Ostrander began recording under the name Mondo Cozmo in 2016, and his single "Shine" hit No. 1 on Billboard's Adult Alternative Songs chart in January 2017. His name comes from a combination of his dog's name, Cozmo, and the 1969 John Waters comedy "Mondo Trasho."
