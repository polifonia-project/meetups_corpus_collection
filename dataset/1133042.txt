== Career ==


=== Stand-up comedy ===
Dwyer began performing stand-up while in college in Chicago, and later moved to Los Angeles. His comedy tends to focus on domestic topics like marriage, family and children. Tahoe Daily Tribune writer Howie Nave described his style as "somewhat sarcastic," but added that "you can see his Midwestern sweetness emerge."In 2001, he recorded a half-hour special for Comedy Central Presents. In 2006, he was a contestant on the fourth season of Last Comic Standing, but was eliminated in the second regular episode, finishing 10th in the competition. He has also performed on Comedy Bang Bang, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn.


=== Game shows ===
Dwyer hosted five seasons of the Comedy Central show BattleBots from 2000 to 2002. He was the play-by-play announcer for the Game Show Network's Extreme Dodgeball in 2004, and in 2006, he hosted a remake of the panel show I've Got a Secret whose twist was that all the featured panelists were gay. The series ran for 40 episodes and was canceled after one season, but the Hollywood Reporter praised Dwyer's  performance as host, calling him "affable and fast with a quip." Other shows Dwyer has hosted include Dirty Rotten Cheater for PAX/Ion Television in 2003, the FSN sports-trivia show Ultimate Fan League, as well as a YouTube series about golf, The Range with Bil Dwyer.
