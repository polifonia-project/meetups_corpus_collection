== Career ==
Warhurst began his career with the alternative rock band OCEAN3, who released several marginal releases and remained active for over a decade.  In 2000, they began touring and sharing a practice space with fellow Vancouver, British Columbia band SNFU. In June 2001, Warhurst joined SNFU for a single gig, replacing long-time bassist Rob Johnson, but the band entered a hiatus shortly thereafter following the departure of drummer Chris Thompson.  OCEAN3 also broke up around this time.
Along with OCEAN3 members Shane Smith and Jay Black, Warhurst joined SNFU guitarist Marc Belke in forming the new group Based on a True Story.  The group was short-lived, however, as Belke relocated to Toronto in 2002.  Smith, Black, and Warhurst then co-founded Slaveco. with SNFU singer Ken Chinn.  Warhurst also began playing with Jakalope in 2002, later appearing on their It Dreams album.In 2003, Belke and Chinn recruited Warhurst and drummer Trevor MacGregor to complete work on a new SNFU record, In the Meantime and In-Between Time.  SNFU properly reformed after the completion of the record, with Warhurst and Smith completing the lineup and performing on their 2004 and 2005 tours.  The group disbanded following this activity.
Warhurst has also produced records for the Canadian band the Invasives. He currently plays in the industrial band Artisan Kane.
