Pierre Dørge (born 28 February 1946) is a Danish avant-garde jazz guitarist. As leader of the New Jungle Orchestra, he combined traditional and modern jazz with West African Highlife guitar music. Among his collaborators have been his wife, pianist Irene Becker, saxophonist John Tchicai, bassist Johnny Dyani, and percussionist Marilyn Mazur.


== Career ==
A native of Copenhagen, Dorge belonged to a free-jazz big band from 1969 to 1971 that was led by John Tchicai. As leader of Thermaenius in 1978, he borrowed from Balkan folk music. Two years later, he led the New Jungle Orchestra, borrowing from African styles. He has worked with Johnny Dyani, Khan Jamal, David Murray, and Don Cherry.
