She is the older sister of André Valadão and Mariana Valadão. She started her music career by participating in a group called King's Kids and her first album was Expressão de Fé, recorded by the King's Kids. Some time later, she participated in the choir El-Shammah and recorded the album Ele Tem Sido Fiel.Valadão studied law at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), but locked up the course in 1996, and therefore decided to attend the Christ for the Nations Institute (CFNI) in Dallas, Texas, United States. When she returned to Brazil, she began writing songs, and she recorded her first album entitled Diante do Trono in 1998. Its creation marked the beginning of the group Diante do Trono. Valadão married the pastor Gustavo Bessa on September 13, 2000, one year and eleven months after they met. Afterward she struggled to conceive and portrayed this difficulty in her CD Esperança, especially in the title track "Esperança". While recording her next CD, Ainda Existe Uma Cruz, she was pregnant with her first son Isaque Valadão Bessa, who was born on January 3, 2006, and on May 23, 2009 her second son, Benjamim Valadão Bessa was born. In the same year, she also released her first solo album As Fontes do Amor.

In August 2009, she and her family moved to Dallas, where her husband continued his ministerial studies. However, she explained on Diante do Trono's official website that she decided that she would not leave the band and would continue to appear in all the group's main events.

She has occupied the 97th position and participated in the program, O Maior Brasileiro de Todos os Tempos (English: The Greatest Brazilian of All Times) by singing Me Ama on Brazilian national television. In December of that year, she was cited by the American publication Forbes as the 89th most influential celebrity in Brazil.

Earlier in the same year, the singer had been invited to attend the global conference Empowered21 held in Israel. At the end of 2015, she and her family moved back to Dallas, where she taught at CFNI and served as a worship pastor at Gateway Church. In this new period, she has ministered in diverse chapels and conferences by the United States, such as IHOPKC, Oral Roberts University, among others. She has also participated in television materials of CBN and Daystar Television Network.In late 2017, she and her family moved to the state of Florida, where her husband continued his studies.
