David Vandervelde is an American indie pop songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist. He is known for his solo work and his studio collaborations with Wilco's Jay Bennett. 


== Career ==
In 2003, Vandervelde moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan where he began recording local bands and friends in his basement studio. When Fonic Records heard the demo Vandervelde recorded for Brie Stoner, the label signed Brie, pairing Vandervelde with ex-Wilco guitarist Jay Bennett to produce a debut at Bennett's Pieholden Studio in Chicago. After the album's release in 2004, Vandervelde began living at Piehoden, working with Bennett on solo work and other recording projects.
Living and working at Pieholden, Vandervelde began a writing and recording streak that would provide the bulk of the material on his debut solo record.  During this fruitful period, Vandervelde played on the Jay Bennett albums Bigger than Blue and The Magnificent Defeat.
In 2007, Secretly Canadian Records released the first David Vandervelde solo album, The Moonstation House Band. Culled from the one-man band sessions at Bennett's studio, the album won praise for its winning melodies and dense arrangements. Vandervelde's sound drew comparisons to T. Rex.
Following its release, Vandervelde relocated to Brooklyn, New York. In 2008, he released his sophomore effort, Waiting for the Sunrise. In April 2008, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee.  
Since 2015, he has been touring with Josh Tillman ("Father John Misty") on the I Love You, Honeybear the Pure Comedy, and the God's Favorite Customer tours as a guitarist, but also playing additional instruments on stage. In 2016, as part of the duo Tess and Dave, he opened for Father John Misty across many of the North American tour dates.
Over the course of 2015-2016, he also engineered and produced Book of Changes by Entrance (2017).Vandervelde now resides in the Long Beach, California area when not on tour.
