Vicente Amigo Girol (born 25 March 1967) is a Spanish flamenco composer and guitarist, born in Guadalcanal near Seville. He has played as an accompanying guitarist on recordings by flamenco singers Camarón de la Isla, and Luis de Córdoba, and he has acted as a producer for Remedios Amaya and José Mercé. His album Ciudad de las Ideas won the 2001 Latin Grammy for the Best Flamenco Album and the 2002 Ondas award for the best Flamenco work.


== Biography ==
Amigo was raised in Córdoba, where he took guitar lessons and later improved his playing with Manolo Sanlúcar, with whom he worked for ten years. After a period of accompaniment which began with El Pele, he devoted himself almost exclusively to playing concerts in 1988. De Mi Corazón al Aire (From Out of My Heart, 1991) was his first solo record. An admirer of Paco de Lucía since childhood, Amigo took part with him in the show Leyendas de la guitarra (Legends of the Guitar) in Seville.
Amigo has worked with Amaia Montero, Khaled, Miguel Bosé, Carmen Linares, Manolo Sanlúcar, Wagner Tiso, Rosario, Nacho Cano, Alejandro Sanz, Sting, Paco de Lucía, Stanley Jordan, John McLaughlin, Al Di Meola, and Milton Nascimento.
