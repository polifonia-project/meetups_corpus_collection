Fess Williams and his Royal Flush Orchestra was the main band of clarinetist Fess Williams from 1926â€“1930


== Brief history ==
In 1926 Williams formed the Royal Flush Orchestra.  The popular hot jazz outfit held residency at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom for most of its life and recorded on the Victor, Vocalion, Gennett, Okeh, Brunswick, Champion, and Harmony labels. Williams, Frank Marvin, and Perry Smith supplied vocals.  The flamboyant Williams typically performed wearing a white suit and top hat.
In 1928 Williams traveled to Chicago where he temporarily fronted Dave Peyton's band at the Regal Theatre.  Calling the group Fess Williams and His Joy Boys, he recorded two sides with them for Vocalion.  The Royal Flush Orchestra continued to operate in his absence, and in 1929 he returned to New York to resume his duties.
The Royal Flush Orchestra recorded its last side in 1930.
