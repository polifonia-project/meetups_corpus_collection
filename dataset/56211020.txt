Lola Langusta is a fashion DJ, music producer, stylist and creative director.


== Early life ==
She was born a fashion baby, and not because she was surrounded by it, but because she was drawn to it. She grew up with very little so she needed to be creative, and did her best to mock the trends with thrift-store finds. She decided if she couldn’t walk the runway, she would do the hair, makeup, styling, and designing instead.
