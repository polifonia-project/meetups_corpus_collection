In addition to pursuing a solo career, Martinez is a founding member of both the Chicharones and the Pissed Off Wild. The Chicharones is an underground pop and hip hop project in collaboration with rapper Sleep of Oldominion, following a chance meeting between the two at South By Southwest that led to the eventual formation of the group. The Pissed Off Wild, (or the P.O.W.), is a live rock band which Martinez fronts. Musically the band draws from artists such as 333 Foreign and Beck.

After the success of his many solo albums and Chicharones material, he proceeded to work on material for his follow-up solo album, World Famous Sex Buffet. Working with some of his regular production partners, he also enlisted the help of some notable guests artists whom he had met over the years. These include Devin The Dude, Classified, Pigeon John, indie rock band Mother Mother, Sleep and Awol One.
