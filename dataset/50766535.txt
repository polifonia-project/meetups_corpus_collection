Eric13 is an American rock musician from Philadelphia, PA. He was the founder, singer and guitarist for Sex Slaves, a loud, daring and unadulterated rock band from New York City. He has since recorded and toured with the industrial band Combichrist, and released two solo acoustic rock 'n' roll albums. Ever evolving as a solo artist, the new single Devil's Highway marks the beginning of a new era with darker and more introspective songs, juxtaposing his current involvement with Combichrist.
