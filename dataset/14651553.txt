She defines herself as "bastardista": violating race, gender and class structures; a hybrid; mostly women made, mestizo mixed, out of rules, illegitimate, from an impure race...; or "nu Brazilian flavor", presenting a Latinized worldbeat – multicultural world music with strong Brazilian roots, singing in Portuguese, English, German, French and Spanish.
Célia Mara is part of the famous movement – famous: platform for famous female culture.
Célia Mara was born in Pedra Azul, Minas Gerais, a small town in the Vale do Jequitinhonha, one of today's poorest regions of the world. Politically, she grew up under a military regime. She began her musical career as a 14-year-old girl, as an autodidact on the guitar. Highly influenced by the revolutionary Tropicalismo, she started early to play songs from Caetano veloso, Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque but also from Mercedes Sosa and her own compositions on local events. In 1979, she was the first girl (and Female composer) of the Vale de Jequintinhonha participating to a regional event, "Los procurados" festival, organized by Tadeu Martins. Later she lived in Belo Horizonte, (had shows at cabare mineiro, "Palacio das Artes") performing as well in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo sesc Pompeia, presenting a fusion between rural and urban songs. TV appearances such as in Som Brasil de Rolando Boldrin, in Rede Globo gave a push to her career.
