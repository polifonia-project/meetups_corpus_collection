Pablo Nassarre (or Nasarre; 1650–1730) was a Spanish priest, organist, and Baroque composer. His work, Escuela Música según la práctica moderna, made him an important theorist of the Baroque era.


== Life ==
Nassarre was born blind in Alagón, Zaragoza, in 1650. He moved to Daroca to be taught by Pablo Bruna, also a blind composer. At age 22, Nassarre became a Franciscan and joined the Royal Convent of San Francisco in Zaragoza, where he was the organist until his death.
He also opened a school of harmony and counterpoint, where José de Torres and Joaquín Martínez de la Roca were his students.
