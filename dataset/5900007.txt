=== Zines ===
Dyer's first work was a small publication called The Silhouette. While in school in Gainesville, Florida in 1988, she worked on the No Idea fanzine with Var Thelin. Unsatisfied with not getting credit for her work to date, Dyer created Mad Planet as her first solo work, and started collecting female zine work.  This collection grew into a project in 1992, when Dyer created and began distributing the Action Girl Newsletter.  This was a review zine, listing zines and mini-comics created by female writers and artists.In an interview, Dyer described the ideal audience of works such as Xena as "post-feminist women and girls."  Dyer donated these zines, accumulated from reviewing for the Action Girl Newsletter, to Duke University, where it formed the core of their Zine Collections at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture.
