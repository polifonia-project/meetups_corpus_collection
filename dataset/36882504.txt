== Personal life ==


=== Military duty exemption ===
In February 2017, it was announced that Seo received his official military enlistment date, set to take place on March 28. He had previously pushed back his enlistment twice, starting in March 2015 and he gave his condition as a reason. Neither the media nor his management company states he did or didn't receive treatment though. But he'd passed a physical to enlist. It was reported he would enter his two-year military service quietly, without media coverage. Seo opted, instead, to release a music video for his self-composed song, "Better Together", written to his fans. The video was released on YouTube on March 26, 2017. However, due to a fractured ankle, Seo was excused from mandatory military service just four days after entering the military and was scheduled for a medical re-examination to determine if he was fit to return to the military. His agency released the results of his medical re-examination, revealing Seo was diagnosed with Osteochondritis dissecans, a bone and cartilage condition. He was subsequently declared at a Grade 5 health rating and became exempt from military duty as a result.
