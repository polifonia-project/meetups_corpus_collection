Kathleen Schlesinger (1862, in Holywood, Ireland – 1953, in London) was a British music archaeologist and curator of musical instruments at the British Museum. She specialized in the history of musical instruments and was called in 1911 "the greatest authority on the subject". In 1939, her Greek Aulos presented her analysis of the modes used on aulos instruments in ancient Greek music.
She was editor of The Portfolio of Musical Archaeology. She was responsible for "practically all of the articles" about musical instruments in the Encyclopædia Britannica of 1911.
