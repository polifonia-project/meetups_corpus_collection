=== 2006: Idol and beginnings ===
AuditionsDanny embarked on his journey in Idol 2006 by auditioning with the song "I Swear" by the vocal quartet All-4-One. He was praised by the jury for his touching and convincing voice. Day joined fellow contestant Felicia Brandström in a duet, singing Bryan Adams' "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You", which according to the jury was the best performance so far in the Idol contest. The jury was unanimous in its opinion that if both were to continue at that level of that performance, they would easily end up in the Idol final.
