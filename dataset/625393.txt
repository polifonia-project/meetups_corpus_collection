His grandmother began teaching him to play the organ when he was a young child, and before he was out of elementary school, he formed small local bands.

As an adult, Reed pursued a music career in Los Angeles. He was a founding member of the club band The Wild in the late 1980s, with whom he spent five years.Reed met the classic lineup of Guns N' Roses in 1985 while his band, The Wild, rehearsed in a neighboring studio. He kept in touch, and in 1990 was invited by friend Axl Rose to join the group for the recording of the two Use Your Illusion albums.
Reed soon became an accepted member of the group and appeared on every album from Use Your Illusion I onward.

In addition to playing keyboards or piano, Reed frequently provides backup on percussion and vocals during live Guns N' Roses performances of older songs, such as "Mr Brownstone", "Nightrain", "Welcome to the Jungle" and "Rocket Queen".
Reed continues to record and play live with the current Guns N' Roses line-up, and has now been a member of Guns N' Roses longer than any other member besides Axl Rose. Although Reed did not co-write any songs during the Illusion sessions, for Chinese Democracy he co-wrote "Chinese Democracy", "Catcher in the Rye", "Street of Dreams", "There Was a Time", "I.R.S", and "Oh My God". It has also been confirmed that the unfinished demo that did not make the cut on Chinese Democracy called "Silkworms" was written by Reed himself and the band's other keyboardist Chris Pitman. The song was re-worked and released as a single under the title "ABSUЯD" in 2021.
