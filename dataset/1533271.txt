In addition to touring, Westlife also released new music. "Hello My Love", the first single from the group's upcoming album, debuted on The Graham Norton Show on 10 and 11 January 2019.


== Television career ==
Egan was one of four coaches on The Voice of Ireland. However, his dreams of winning the show went to tatters as he threw his lot in with Jim Devine, from Northern Ireland. This immediately put him at a disadvantage to the other contestants as, ahead of the final, viewers in Northern Ireland could not download his single, the tally of which contributed to his vote. Egan was left fuming and in need of support from Sharon Corr as he expressed his opinion on the unfairness of it all and had "huge rows" about it but to no avail.In June 2012, Egan announced in an interview with the Sunday Life that he was "looking at doing a TV show with Sky on surfing". Later reports suggested that the show would be eight episodes long and would broadcast on Sky1 later in the year.In July 2012, Egan presented the British programme This Morning's Hub on a regular basis, standing in for the regular hosts. Later that year, every Friday morning in October, he began giving reports on another British programme This Morning about the remaining contestants in the ninth series of  The X Factor, before the competition's live shows that weekend.
On 21 October 2012, Egan co-presented the revamped version of Surprise Surprise, but did not return the following year.
In 2013, Egan appeared on the thirteenth series of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!. He was ultimately crowned King Of The Jungle, which contributed to an invitation to being signed by Rhino Records to create his Home album. From 5 to 9 January 2015, Egan and Angela Griffin co-hosted Fat Pets: Slimmer of the Year on ITV.
