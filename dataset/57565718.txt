Palmenia del Carmen Pizarro González (born 19 July 1941), better known as Palmenia Pizarro, is a Chilean singer.


== Biography ==
Palmenia Pizarro was born in San Felipe, Valparaíso Region, in the neighborhood of El Almendral. She discovered her taste for music in childhood. Her parents and her teacher motivated her to start a long career, full of difficulties, at age seven.
When she was eleven, she moved to Santiago to try her luck as a singer. At sixteen, her talent was recognized by some radio stations, and she was awarded as "Best Folkloric Performer". Her participation in the Así Canta Perú radio contest in 1962 led the EMI label to hire her.
In 1963, songs like "Mi Pobreza" and "Amarga Experiencia" achieved spectacular sales. Her shows were blockbusters, achieving the recognition of both critics and the Chilean public.
It was with the song "Cariño Malo" by Peruvian composer Augusto Polo Campos that Pizarro achieved her breakthrough. However, a series of events, exacerbated by some journalists and Chilean television presenters (including Don Francisco), forced her to settle in Mexico. From a performance on the Televisa program Siempre en Domingo, and at the hand of the great Chavela Vargas, she achieved a successful career in that country. From there she obtained the necessary recognition to start a successful international career, which led her to appear in countries such as Australia, the United States, Argentina, and Japan (where she met Atahualpa Yupanqui and recorded two songs in Japanese).
In 1997, Pizarro returned to Chile, where she achieved important recognitions and tributes from both the world of culture and her fans.
In 2007 she joined the Canal 13 television program Cantando por un sueño as mentor of the pair of participants Carolina Vargas and Lizardo Garrido.Palmenia Pizarro has influenced different musicians in Chile, including Mon Laferte and Los Vásquez.
