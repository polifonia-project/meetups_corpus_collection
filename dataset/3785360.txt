In 1985, she recorded her first record on the Radio-Canada International label. She is the first artist to be published on the Analekta label, in 1988. Since then, she has recorded an average of two albums a year, and is regularly awarded in the category of classical albums in the Félix Awards.From 1994 to 1997, she hosted a series of concert broadcasts and weekly music programs for Radio-Canada, featuring young Quebec musicians.

Dubeau plays the "Des Rosiers" Stradivarius violin from 1733.  She received this violin in 1976 when the violinist and previous owner Arthur Leblanc met Dubeau and heard her play. The violin was classified as a national heritage by former Quebec premier René Lévesque.
