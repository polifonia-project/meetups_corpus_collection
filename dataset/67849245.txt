Ricky Montgomery (born April 3, 1993) is an American singer, musician and songwriter. In 2020, his songs went viral on TikTok, leading to being signed with Warner Records later that year.


== Early life ==
He was born in Los Angeles. His mother was a teacher, and his father was a gaffer. Early on, his parents got a divorce, and, in 2005, he and his mother moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he began to play in various bands at the age of 14. In 2014, he gained a following on Vine, a short-form video service, posting comical original songs. He found the site the day after the app had launched, from a CNN news article. He saw the site as a potential "springboard for a possible music career." After finding success with that, Montgomery released his first EP, Caught On The Moon. Soon after, he dropped out of college and returned to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career.He has a sister.


== Career ==
In LA, he released his first studio album "Montgomery Ricky" on April 1, 2016. Montgomery founded indie band The Honeysticks with a childhood friend of his to experiment musically. The band name was derived from a snack Montgomery ate every Saturday morning when he was a kid, made of sticks of honey. In 2018 he took the year off of making music and started social media marketing companies to earn more money, and by 2020 was considering quitting making music entirely. However, in mid-2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, his two singles—Mr Loverman and Line Without A Hook—went viral on TikTok. With his explosion in popularity, he had been contacted by "virtually every single major label A&R in a matter of months." And in December 2020, after a large bidding war, he signed with Warner Records.
I think because we had a really traumatizing year, these songs kind of found a moment, because they're all, in their own way, about traumas in my life.
Since then, he has remixed two songs in 2021 from his debut album with fellow artists Chloe Moriondo and mxmtoon respectively. Montgomery came in contact with mxmtoon after finding her perform one of his songs on the streaming platform Twitch, learning that she had been a fan of his Vine content before it shut down. He found Moriondo from a song cover of Out Like A Light.Montgomery is planning on working on his second album.
