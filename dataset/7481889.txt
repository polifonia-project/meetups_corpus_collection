Britt Woodman (June 4, 1920 – October 13, 2000) was an American jazz trombonist.


== Career ==
Woodman was a childhood friend of Charles Mingus, but first worked with Phil Moore and Les Hite. After service in World War II he played with Boyd Raeburn before joining with Lionel Hampton in 1946. During the 1950s he worked with Ellington. As a member of Ellington's band he can be heard on Such Sweet Thunder (1957), Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Song Book (also 1957), Black, Brown, and Beige (1958) and Ellington Indigos (1958).
In 1960 he left Ellington to work in a pit orchestra. Later he worked with Mingus and can be heard on the album Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus (1963). In the 1970s, he led his own octet and worked with pianist Toshiko Akiyoshi. In 1989, he was in the personnel for the album Epitaph dedicated to the previously unrecorded music of Charles Mingus.
He died in Hawthorne, California at the age of 80, having suffered severe respiratory problems.
