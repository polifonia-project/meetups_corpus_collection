On 31 May 2013, whilst performing at the Greek Theatre Berkeley, Dwane had an acute subdural haematoma which went undiagnosed for over a week. Dwane went on to perform six gigs before finally being correctly diagnosed and treated in Austin on 11 June. He was discharged on 13 June after a successful operation. Mumford & Sons had to cancel three performances in America including the 2013 Bonnaroo Music Festival so Dwane could fully recover. Touring for the band resumed three weeks later for their headline slot at Glastonbury Festival.
