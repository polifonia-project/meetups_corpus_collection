Ulf-Diether Soyka (born 5 June 1954) is an Austrian composer, conductor and lecturer.


== Musical creation and compositional style ==
Soyka was born in Vienna, Austria.  He prefers to write music for the concert hall, for orchestra, chamber music, choral works and operas.  His compositional style was described by Dr. Werner Pelinka in 1987 in the cultural magazine morgen:

“„Soyka´s music is influenced by  the twelve-tone system, but not by the dogmatic, serial kind. Rather it is an extended twelve-tone style, determined by melodic and rhythmic ideas, by emotions. It is just this emotional aspect which triggers an immediate response and understanding in the listener, even though one might not be able to follow every rational structure and detail. His tone language is varied, beautifully melodious as well as spirited and powerful in rhythm.”
Soyka also investigated connections between chromatic and micro-interval music. Since 2007 he brought out his publication about micro interval composition theory. In 2012 he also brought out his (very melodic) opera Ninja, in which micro-tonality is assigned mainly to one of the principal characters, the Robot Androido, in order to underline the “emotions” of this character adequately.
