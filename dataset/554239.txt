== Career ==
Curtis was raised in Saco, Maine. By the age of fifteen she was playing drums for a local theater company and in her late teens she sat in with Foreigner on a performance of "I Want to Know What Love Is". She graduated from Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island with a degree in history and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where she began working the folk rock circuit.
Curtis self-released the cassette-only Dandelion in 1989; her first CD, From Years to Hours, in 1991; and her second CD, Truth from Lies, in 1995. She did not gain wide recognition, however, until a successful appearance at The Bottom Line in New York City led to a contract with EMI/Guardian Records and the re-release of Truth from Lies in 1996. Her 1997 follow-up, Catie Curtis, was named Album of the Year at that year's Gay and Lesbian American Music Awards. Her discography now runs to thirteen albums, including the highly regarded A Crash Course in Roses (1999).Her songs have featured in Alias, Dawson's Creek, Grey's Anatomy, Felicity and Chicago Hope, as well as in several independent films. In 2005, she and Mark Erelli won the Grand Prize in the International Songwriting Competition for "People Look Around", a song written in response to Hurricane Katrina.Curtis has toured internationally as both headliner and support act. In 2009, she performed at the HRC Equality Ball in celebration of President Barack Obamaâ€™s inauguration. She performed at the White House the following year and again in 2011. Her tenth studio album Hello Stranger (2009) was produced by Garry West, and supported by Alison Brown and Stuart Duncan, along with Gary Marinelli (acoustic guitars, mandolin and resophonic guitar), Kenny Malone (drums and percussion) and Todd Phillips (acoustic bass).
