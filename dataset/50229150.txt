Ferré Gola, also Ferre Gola, whose full name is Hervé Gola Bataringe, is a DR Congolese recording artist. He at one time was a member of legendary  Congolese bands, Wenge Musica Maison Mère and Quartier Latin International.


== Background ==
He was born on 3 March 1976, in Kinshasa, the largest city and capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. From an early age, he was passionate about becoming a professional musician. Ferré Gola began his career in a band in Bandalungwa commune called "Rumba des Jeunes" before making his historic entry in "Wenge Musica" in 1995.
At the split of this group, Ferré Gola joined Werrason in Wenge Musica Maison Mère for 7 years, before creating with Bill Clinton Kalonji and JDT Mulopwe "Les Marquis de Maison mère". But, "Les Marquis" burst out a few months later after the triumphant release of the opus "Miracles", best album at the KORA awards 2005 in South Africa.


== Career ==
In 1995 during at a talent fair in Bandalungwa, one the city of Kinshasa's communes, he was spotted and recruited by Werrason into the group Wenge Musica 4*4. When that band broke up, Gola, Werrason, Didier Masela, and Adolphe created the group Wenge Musica Maison Mère where he spent seven years from 1997 to 2004. He left the group Werrason in 2004 to found The Marquis de Maison Mère with JDT Mulopwe and Bill Clinton Kalonji who also left Werrason. In 2005, Gola joined the group Quartier Latin International, of Koffi Olomide, leaving for a solo career in 2006, the same year Fally Ipupa left. While at Quartier Latin, one of the memorable hits he produced was the song Sisi Silvie Remix where he collaborated with Olomide.
