He played with Muggsy Spanier intermittently from 1953 through the end of the decade and with Fletcher Henderson in 1957–58. In 1958, he performed as a solo act in Columbus, Ohio, then played with Wild Bill Davison in 1958–59 and again in 1962.In 1960 he formed Saints & Sinners with Vic Dickenson, playing with this band until 1970. He joined jazz drummer Chuck Slate and his band in 1971 and stayed with him most of the year. He recorded an album with Slate called Bix 'n' All That Jazz.  Following this he worked with Eddie Condon (1975–77), then led a trio in 1977–78. He played with Panama Francis and the Savoy Sultans worldwide from 1979 through the 1980s.
