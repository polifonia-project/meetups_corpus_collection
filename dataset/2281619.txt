Rhoderick Ramos Santos (born October 10, 1982), more commonly known as simply Erik Santos, is a Filipino singer, occasional actor, TV host, commercial model, and the first Grand Champion of the ABS-CBN singing competition Star in a Million Season 1 in 2003.Erik Santos was ABS-CBN's Star in a Million Grand Champion last January 2004. A young balladeer known for his soulful voice, Erik made his way to stardom through the music scene owing the title Prince of Pop. His much-awaited debut album aptly titled "This Is The Moment" shows that Erik's moment has indeed come.
His passion for music started during his childhood years. He participated in various singing competitions.
His Platinum debut album and succeeding albums, sold-out concerts and a demand for corporate shows, accolades from Awit Awards, Star Awards and Aliw Awards, endorsements for a bank (Bank of the Philippine Island's Express Remit), theme songs for radio stations, and even movies earned him an unusual popularity.
His first single, Pagbigyang Muli, remained number one of WRR's hit chart for more than 20 weeks together with his other songs filling up the chart simultaneously.
Amidst all these, Erik still remains charming and this "realness" becomes one of the biggest factors why Erik has won audiences nationwide.


== Early life ==
Santos was born on October 10, 1982 in Malabon, Metro Manila, Philippines. When he was four, his passion for singing started. He participated in numerous small-town singing competitions.
He graduated in high school at Immaculate Conception Parochial School – Malabon
He studied at the Centro Escolar University and took up dentistry, but later shifted to Psychology. As soon as he won the singing competition Star in a Million in 2003, he temporarily stopped studying, because of his busy schedule. Eventually, he came back to school and finished college. He graduated in March 2010.


=== Star in a Million ===
In 2003, Santos joined Star in a Million singing contest, and became part of the wildcard entry to the Final 10 of the show. He had a good start in the competition, but got eliminated during the third week of the show, when it was still a part of the Sunday noontime variety show ASAP. Nevertheless, his second chance came, and his rendition of R. Kelly's "I Believe I Can Fly", won him the tenth and final slot for the semi-finals round. Eventually he became one of the three grand finalists along with Sheryn Regis (first runner up) and Marinel Santos (2nd runner up) in the showdown for the title of Star in a Million. "This is the Moment", a song from the musical Jekyll and Hyde, popularized by Martin Nievera, won him the title.


== Career ==
In 2004, Santos released his debut album This is the Moment, and it went platinum after three months of its release. After his debut, he released an extended play, quickly followed by his second album, Loving You Now. The album was released with the hit single "Bakit Ba Iniibig Ka", composed by Ogie Alcasid, and sung as a duet with Asia's Songbird Regine Velasquez. In December 2005, he held his first major solo concert at the Marikina Riverbanks. On October 19, 2007, he staged another major concert at the Araneta Coliseum, entitled Erik Santos ...
