Her break came after being scouted by producer Akiyoshi Nishioka, who had been familiar with her since her participation at Senko Riot 2009. She was invited to send a demo to SME Records, not initially intending it to be used as a debut single. As the staff liked it, she was offered a major debut and for the song to be released.
