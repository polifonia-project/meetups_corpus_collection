Annie Herring (born Annie Ward September 22, 1945) is one of the pioneers of the Jesus music genre, later to be called Contemporary Christian music. She was a member of the trio 2nd Chapter of Acts, for which she wrote most of the songs and sang lead and harmony vocals with her brother Matthew Ward and sister Nelly (Ward) Greisen.  During her musical career with the 2nd Chapter of Acts from 1973 to 1988, she also recorded solo albums.


== Early history ==
Annie Herring's music and ministry was, in no small part, forged from personal family tragedy. In 1968, her mother, Elizabeth Ward, died of a brain tumor; two years later her father, Walter, died of leukemia leaving her youngest sister, Nelly, and brother, Matthew, orphaned.  The Ward siblings decided that Annie and her new husband, record producer Buck Herring, should take in the two younger Ward siblings.Annie was a self-taught singer and songwriter who wrote and played her songs around the family piano.  Her brother and sister would often join in as she played, and eventually they developed extremely tight and intricate harmonies.As they gradually started singing for local coffee houses and small gatherings, they eventually gained the notice of Pat Boone who arranged a contract to record and release two singles with MGM, "Jesus Is" (1972) and "I'm So Happy" (1973). The fledgling trio also came to the attention of 1960s folk singer Barry McGuire, who had recently become a Christian and was preparing to record his first Christian music album, to be produced by Buck Herring. The siblings provided background vocals for Seeds and McGuire's 1974 follow-up, Lighten Up. The group would take the name "The 2nd Chapter of Acts", and Annie continued to sing with her siblings as part of 2nd Chapter of Acts until 1988, when each member of the group felt called to different careers.Herring was a guest on 100 Huntley Street, and was included in the "Hall of Honor" in Homecoming Magazine in 2013.


== Solo career ==
During her time with 2nd Chapter, Annie had released two solo albums, "Through a Child's Eyes" and "Search Deep Inside", as well as an album for children, "Kids of the Kingdom".  After 2nd Chapter disbanded, Annie continued her solo career.  Annie continued to tour the US through the 1990s and early 2000s, giving 40 to 50 concerts a year.  During that time she continued to receive songs and record solo albums, to which her siblings from 2nd Chapter often added backup vocals.  She also occasionally adds her vocals to other artist’s albums. Though officially retired from touring, Annie continues to make music and minister privately, as well as take time for more relaxing pursuits such as learning to play golf.
