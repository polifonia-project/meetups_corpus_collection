Born Jesse Williams III, he was one of the first rappers signed to Motown Records and, in 1989, released the album "No Prisoners". He then went on to produce hit songs with many artists including GZA, Xzibit, Heavy D and KRS-One among others.  One of Bad Boy Records' original "Hitmen", West recorded Biggie Smalls first demo as well as produced remixes for songs on Mary J. Blige's album, What's the 411?
As rapper 3rd Eye, it has been argued that Jesse West was the first rapper to use the term "bling"  on Super Cat's 1993 hit "Dolly My Baby (Remix)" - a song that West produced and also featured Puff Daddy and a young Biggie Smalls in his recording debut.
