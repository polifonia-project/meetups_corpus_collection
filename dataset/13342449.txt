=== Blazin' Squad (2001–06) ===
Blazin' Squad were a ten-piece hip hop group. They enjoyed moderate success in the UK, achieving six consecutive Top 10 hits, including the number one single "Tha Crossroads", which is a cover version of the Bone Thugs-N-Harmony song. They released two albums which just made the UK Top 40 album chart. While in the Blazin' Squad, he went by the name MC Kenzie.
The group subsequently split in 2005. MC Kenzie, MC Flava and MC Strider went on to form the group Friday Hill (as Kenzie, James and Mus). They split up and on 2009 five of the original Blazin' Squad members released a single ("Let's Start Again") after reforming. It peaked at number 51 on the UK Singles Chart. One of their first performances after their reformation was at Walthamstow School for Girls, a school in the group's local area, where his father taught.

In December 2013, it was revealed that Kenzie would be joining forces with Adam Rickitt, Gareth Gates, Dane Bowers and Kavana to form the supergroup 5th Story for the second series of ITV2's The Big Reunion.
