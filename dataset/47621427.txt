Jagoda Szmytka (born 15 January 1982, Legnica) is a Polish composer. She has attracted attention for her style of music, which uses elements not only of sound, but also of the sense of space and visual arts, and also for her new opera,  Dla głosów i rąk (For Voices and Hands). She is a well-known composer in Europe and has been recognized abroad, winning numerous juried scholarships, including the Staubach Honoraria for Composition.


== Biography ==
Jagoda Szmytka studied history of art and philosophy at the University of Wrocław, Poland (2000-2005) as well as composition and music theory with Krystian Kiełb and Cezary Duchnowski at the Karol Lipiński Academy of Music in Wrocław. This was followed by postgraduate studies in composition with Pierluigi Billone and Beat Furrer at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz (2007-2008), with Beat Furrer at the Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts (2008-2010), and with Wolfgang Rihm at the Karlsruhe University of Music (2010-2012).Szmytka has received numerous scholarships and grants from various foundations including Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education and Research (ÖAD) (2008), an artist grant funded by the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (2008), German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) (2008/09), a scholarship of the Oscar und Vera Ritter Stiftung (2010), a scholarship from the Baden-Württemberg Art Foundation (2011), Alfred Toepfer Stiftung (2011), the Wolfgang Rihm Scholarship of the Hoepfner Foundation (2011), and the Staubach Honorarium for Composition by the Darmstadt Summer Courses (2012).In both 2011 and 2014 she was composer-in-residence at ZKM Karlsruhe, which in between those appointments she had served as composer-in-residence at La Muse en circuit Paris.

== Work ==
Szmytka's work uses sound and also includes visual elements such as text, theatre and painting.The work on her release, "Bloody Cherries," was performed mainly by Ensemble Garage, and was considered to be sensual and gestural by Polityka.Szmytka’s compositions are featured at international festivals and institutions including Warsaw Autumn, where she premiered "Lost." Her work has been performed at the Lucerne Festival, Festival Ultraschall Berlin, Wien Modern, Eclat-Festival Stuttgart, Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music, Musica Polonica Nova, Rheinsberger Musiktage, Deutschlandfunk Cologne, ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, Polish National Opera Warsaw. Ensembles performing her works include Ensemble Garage, Ensemble Interface, ensemble recherche, European Workshop for Contemporary Music, IEMA, E-MEX Ensemble, Duo leise dröhnung, Kwartludum, Ensemble l'arsenale, Ensemble Besides.Szmytka presents a strong personality, extraordinary intellect, and perfect artistic intuition, which has led her towards Internet culture, trans-media art, and, broadly understood, the boundaries between music and other arts. She draws inspiring themes from these areas in a creative and intellectual manner. I believe that she thoroughly reflects upon everything she does. She works strategically. Recently, she has been working as a performer and a curator as she constantly expands her field of activity and redefines the role of an artist.
