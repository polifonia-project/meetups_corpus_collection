She performed as a cellist with the Sydney Youth Opera and was later a bass guitarist in a few local indie rock bands.Wonderland later recalled how she developed an interest in electronic dance music, "I went out to a club called Candy's Apartment... Someone played 'Silent Shout' by the Knife... I remember just completely zoning out... and walking over to the DJ and asking, 'What is this track?! Please tell someone what this track is, because this is amazing'." Her performance name is a pun to the Lewis Carroll novel Alice in Wonderland.


=== Mental health ===
In 2018, Alison Wonderland revealed that she had been battling depression and suicidal thoughts, caused by an abusive relationship.
