Gille (ジル, Jiru, born January 4, 1987), stylized GILLE, is a Japanese singer originally from Saito, Miyazaki. She made her major debut in 2012, but had previously performed under the name TASHA gee. Gille made a name for herself by releasing videos of herself singing English language covers of Japanese pop songs on her YouTube channel appearing only in silhouette, including some English songs such as "Rolling in the Deep", featured on her debut EP Lead the Way. In June 2012, she released an English cover of AKB48's "Flying Get", and the group's creator Yasushi Akimoto remarked that Gille had a "diamond voice" and fully approved the cover. Gille made her debut with the album I AM GILLE. in July 2012, which eventually became certified as gold. Her debut single "Girls / Winter Dream" was released that October, and was noted to sample O-Zone's "Dragostea Din Tei". This was followed up by the single "Try Again" in January 2013 and the album GILLEsound Vol. 1.
