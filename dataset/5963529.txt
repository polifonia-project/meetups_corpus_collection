Mike Pelanconi, better known under his record name Prince Fatty, is a British sound engineer and record producer.


== Biography ==
As a record producer, Pelanconi has worked with a diverse repertoire of artists and labels, from the acid jazz of the 1990s to rock musicians like Graham Coxon (of Blur), reggae legends like Gregory Isaacs and Dub Syndicate, and pop singers such as Lily Allen.  Other musicians he has worked with include JD from A Tribe Called Quest, Pharcyde, N'Dea Davenport, Brand New Heavies, Mother Earth, Kula Shaker, The Sugarhill Gang, Little Roy, Adrian Sherwood/ON-U Sound, Lo Fidelity Allstars, Born Jamericans, Luciano, Capleton, Nostalgia 77 and The Skints.
In 2005, the clothing company Stüssy put together a line inspired by the vivid, rootsy styles of Jamaica to commemorate their 25th anniversary, and looked to create a limited-edition single to complement it.  Inspired by the optimistic, laid-back vibe of Jamaica in the early 1970s, Pelanconi was part of a group created by Nasser Bouzida and Trevor Harding of Big Boss Man called "Prince Fatty," meant as a tongue-in-cheek reference to King Tubby.  The instrumental track they wrote and played, "Nina's Dance," was unexpectedly successful, getting airplay on BBC Radio 1.  Following its success, Prince Fatty decided to create an album length homage to what they considered one of the most vibrant eras in Jamaican music.
Subsequently, Pelanconi co-opted the name of the band for a second Prince Fatty album called Survival of the Fattest, assembling a "supergroup" of reggae greats, including afrobeat saxophonist Bukky Leo, drummer Style Scott from the Roots Radics, Nostalgia 77's horn section, and Hammond organ by Bubblers from Ruff Cut Band. Guest vocals were provided by Hollie Cook, singer from The Slits and daughter of former Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook, as well as Winston Francis, and  Little Roy.The album was recorded on vintage analogue equipment to preserve the signature sound of reggae and dub records.  Pelanconi also strove to update the sound by speeding up tempos and attempting to push the boundaries of classic dub and reggae by referencing the modern influences of hip-hop (especially evident in the cover of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg's  "Gin and Juice", as well as Ol' Dirty Bastard's "Shimmy Shimmy Ya").This was followed in 2010 with Super Size, featuring vocals from Little Roy, Dennis Alcapone, Natty and Winston Francis.On 6 September 2011, in association with the Mutant HiFi, 'Prince Fatty and the Mutant HiFi's Online Dub Service' was launched on Facebook, offering people an easy way to get dubs from the studio by sending their tracks to receive the 'Heavyweight Dub Treatment'.
His 2012 album Prince Fatty Versus the Drunken Gambler included a guest appearance from Dennis Alcapone.In an interview with audio and music publication MusicnGear  Pelanconi said that the primary DAW he works in is ProTools; stating 'I love the vari-speed function as it works like a tape machine - speeding music up and down can yield interesting results'. He also said that his favorite plugins so far are SSL plugins.
