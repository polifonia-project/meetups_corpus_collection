Having worked as an ambiental music composer, in 1989, Aćin founded the gothic rock band BAAL, as its keyboardist and lead vocalist, with bass guitarist Srđa Popović, guitarist Vojkan Petković, and drummer Vlada Marinković. The band released their debut album Između božanstva i ništavila (Between Divinity and Nothingness) in 1992. The album, recorded at the Cacadu studio on April 1992, featured guest appearances by Mizar vocalist Goran Tanevski, on the track "Talas" ("The Wave"), Ekatarina Velika, frontman Milan Mladenović, guitar on the title track, Van Gogh frontman Zvonimir Đukić, guitar on the track "Pad" ("The Fall"), and Ekatarina Velika drummer Marko Milivojević, on the track "Iščezavam" ("I Am Fading Away"). Having released the album, the band performed regularly until 1995, when they decided to stop working together.

After the disbandment of BAAL, Aćin worked on the material intended to be released on the second BAAL album, released in 1996 by Image Records on the EP Artoodeeto, featuring seven tracks and released under the name Retro Deux. The release, produced by the dance music producer Srđan Babović, featured the lyrics in Serbian, French, and English language. Beside the vocal duties, Aćin played the keyboard and programing parts, while guest appearances featured guitarists Duda Petrović and Nebojša Marić and percussionist Aleksandar Milanović. Promotional video was recorded for the track "Run". The band appeared on the hip hop band WHO Is The BEST album Play, released by CentroScena in 1998, on the track "Još jedan dim" ("Yet Another Smoke"). The previous year, the track appeared on the various artists compilation Time Out, released by Komuna

In early 1998, Aćin collaborated with the French group Noir Désir, performing live as well as working on the remix CD One Trip, One Noise  with his mixes of the tracks "Fin de siecle (G.L.Y.O)" and "Septembre en attendent (un jour a Belgrade)".
For the Milan Konjević's movie Waiting (For Death), Aćin recorded two instrumental tracks, "Waiting 1" and "Waiting 2". In 1995, he recorded music for the omnibus movie Paket aranžman, directed by Srđan Golubović. During the same year he also worked on the soundtrack of the Slepi kolosek. He composed for three Dejan Zečević's movies, Kupi mi Eliota, released in 1997, T.T. Syndrome, released in 2000, and Mala noćna muzika, released in 2002.
