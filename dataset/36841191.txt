T.T. Ross was a British lovers rock singer best known for her 1970s singles "Last Date" and "Imagine".
After beginning to record in the mid-1970s, including singles recorded as duets with Gene Rondo, Ross first found success on the British reggae charts in 1975 with "Last Date", produced by Dennis Harris and released on the Lucky label, one of the early releases in the lovers rock genre. The single was later licensed to Polydor Records. She had further success with a cover version of John Lennon's "Imagine" in 1978. One of few white singers in the genre at the time, she was known as 'The White Lady of Reggae'. She continued to record into the early 1980s.
