Anna Tsuchiya (土屋 アンナ, Tsuchiya Anna, born March 11, 1984) is a Japanese singer, actress and semi-retired model. Since 2005, she is primarily known as a singer.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Tsuchiya was born in Tokyo to a Japanese mother and an American father of Irish and Polish descent (the surname of her father is Hider). In her earliest years, she spoke English and Japanese. Tsuchiya's parents divorced when she was seven. She has an older sister, Angela.


=== Modeling career ===
Tsuchiya's modeling career began at the age of fourteen after her older sister Angela, a former fashion model, suggested it. She entered her sister's former agency and was picked up by an agent who specialized in magazine-modeling and her first jobs consisted of modeling for an open collection in Kobe and for Japanese Seventeen in 1998. Demand for her grew and by 2002, she was doing television commercials for Uniqlo and Edwin.


=== Inspiration for "Ichigo" ===
Her best known role in acting was as "Ichigo Shirayuri" – a rural-delinquent biker-gang girl turned fashion model – in the 2004 movie Kamikaze Girls. Ichigo as a model was portrayed as one with tendencies for violent behavior and delinquency. This Blue Ribbon Award-winning role, quite different from one in the original work written by author and designer Nobara Takemoto, was loosely based on Tsuchiya's actual story which she later revealed after the movie's release.


=== Retirement ===
Tsuchiya retired from modeling at 18. She has said that she realized she could no longer compete with "gifted ones" like Emi Suzuki. She remains in demand for fashion and lifestyle magazines like Kera, Soup, and Zipper.On June 2, 2007, Tsuchiya attended the official retirement ceremony for the sumo wrestler Kyokushuzan held in Ryogoku Kokugikan and presenting him with a bouquet, and appeared in his memorial photobook released on June 4, 2007.


=== Use of dialects ===
Although born and raised in Tokyo, she sometimes uses Kyushu or Okinawa slang and speaks in southern dialects especially when she is drunk and on the radio. She has explained that the majority of models she encountered were from the southern islands or the north, so she learned slang from them. This helped the development of her character Ichigo, the Bōsōzoku delinquent, in Kamikaze Girls.


=== Music career ===
Tsuchiya sang in her school choir and has been involved in the music industry since age 16. At 18, she terminated her contract with Japanese Seventeen, and supposedly decided to leave show business altogether. However, after an offer by former Oblivion Dust member K.A.Z, she invested in her music career in mid-2002, she formed the rock duo Spin Aqua with K.A.Z. Tsuchiya has said her influences have changed over the years, from Whitney Houston, Diana Ross, Cyndi Lauper, Bette Midler and Mariah Carey, to Bon Jovi and Guns N' Roses.Soon after she debuted as a singer, she was sometimes dubbed "The Second Nanase" because of her resemblance to Nanase Aikawa. Spin Aqua released three singles, one album, and a video collection, without commercial success. In 2004, Tsuchiya became pregnant, and the group disbanded.In 2005, Tsuchiya announced plans to begin a solo career.
