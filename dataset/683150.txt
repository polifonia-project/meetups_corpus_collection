On June 4, 2021, Bell was arrested in Cleveland, Ohio, on charges relating to "attempted endangering [of] children and disseminating matter harmful to juveniles." A public information officer with the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office, said "the 15-year-old victim, who had established a relationship with Bell several years prior, attended his concert in December 2017 [...] While there, Bell violated his duty of care and, in doing so, created a risk of harm to the victim." The Cleveland Police also found that Bell had sent the minor "inappropriate social media messages" for "months leading up to the concert." Bell was 31 at the time of the alleged incident. Bell pleaded not guilty, and was freed on a $2,500 personal bond, and was ordered to provide a DNA sample.

Bell was sentenced to two years of probation and 200 hours of community service (which he may complete in California). He also is not allowed to have any contact with his accuser.
