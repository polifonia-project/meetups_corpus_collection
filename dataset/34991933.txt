Katari Terrance Cox (born December 30, 1976) better known by his stage name Kastro, is an American rapper. A cousin of Tupac Shakur, Kastro would perform alongside him in the former's rap group, the Outlawz, and is featured on many of the late rapper's songs such as "Made Niggaz", & "Hail Mary". When he was in elementary school, he introduced his friend, and future Outlawz rapper, Malcolm Greenridge, later named E.D.I. Mean, to his cousin.


== Career ==
Kastro started rapping with the name "K-Dog". He was in a rap group with Big Malcolm (E.D.I. Mean), and Young Hollywood (Yaki Kadafi) in the beginning and began rapping in some of 2Pac's songs during the Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. sessions. They then added Mutah (Napoleon) to the group and became known as Dramacydal.
On March 14, 1995, K-Dog was featured on 2Pac's 3x Platinum album Me Against The World, on the song "Outlaw".
The next year, on February 13, 1996, he was featured on Tupac's 10x Platinum Double LP All Eyez On Me on the songs "Tradin War Stories", "When We Ride", & "Thug Passion". It was around the time of this album's recording sessions when Tupac gave K-Dog his name "Kastro". He was named after Fidel Castro for the Outlawz anti-American leader theme
On June 4, 1996, Kastro was featured in 2Pac's "Hit 'Em Up" music video, along with the rest of the Outlawz. The song was the B-side to Shakur's "How Do U Want It" single and was a vicious diss song aimed at Bad Boy Entertainment, Mobb Deep, & Chino XL. The song is widely considered the most aggressive hip-hop diss tracks ever recorded.
The same year Kastro was featured on Shakur's 4x Platinum album The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, on the songs "Hail Mary" & "Life of An Outlaw"
On September 7, 1996, Tupac was fatally wounded by gunshots on the Las Vegas Strip and was rushed to a hospital at the University of Las Vegas. He died six days later on September 13, 1996, at the age of 25. Kastro was present when the shooting took place. He was in the car directly behind Tupac but could not identify the shooters.
