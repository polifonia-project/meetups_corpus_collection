The song was released on iTunes Japan as a digital single. miray was initially under the Avex sub-label Rhythm Zone. On August 4, 2010 (four years prior to the single), she and had featured KM-MARKIT on her album miray in the song "Box Seat" (stylized as BOX SEAT). However, upon the release of Magnetic, she was no longer under the Rhythm Zone sub-label and chose to focus on independent work.
