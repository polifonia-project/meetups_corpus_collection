== Personal life ==
Bourgeois is originally from Boonville, New York. A self-proclaimed "music geek," he played percussion in a variety of groups and ensembles throughout elementary and high school. He credits much of his current success to his parents' support for his early decision to pursue a career in the arts:

My parents always made my sister and I feel that we could accomplish anything as long as we understood the work involved to reach our goals. There's no question that this support has played a big part in my life today.
At age twenty, Bourgeois moved to Albany in pursuit of his musical interests, performing and recording in multiple area bands and studying percussion and electronic music at the University at Albany. He soon began to gain studio experience as well, starting with recording and composition for singer-songwriters and commercial advertising and progressing to projects that cemented his role as a music producer.
