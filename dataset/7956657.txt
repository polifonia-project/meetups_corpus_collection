Kamini Zantoko is a Black French musician and screenwriter.


== Personal life ==
Kamini's father—Seyolo Zantoko—and his family moved from Zaire to Marly-Gomont, France in 1975.  They had difficulty assimilating as the first Black people in town.  Kamini grew up there, and by summer 2006, was working part-time as a nurse.  Seyolo died sometime prior to 2012.


== Career ==
Aspiring to make hip hop music, in 2006 he wrote about Marly-Gomont ("Marly-Gomont").  In his music video, made on a budget of €100 (equivalent to €117 in 2020), he raps "about cows and tractors and soccer" with his friends and fellow villagers.  On 30 August, Kamini uploaded the video and cold-emailed promotions to record companies; instead, a t-shirt retailer shared the link online, and by the end of the day, "Marly-Gomont" was a hit.  Off the merits of his amateur viral video, Kamini signed with RCA Records in mid-October to publish "Marly-Gomont" and two more albums.In 2012, Kamini wrote and narrated the autobiographical film The African Doctor (French: Bienvenue à Marly-Gomont, lit. 'Welcome to Marly-Gomont') to pay tribute to his father.  It was released in 2016, directed by Julien Rambaldi.
