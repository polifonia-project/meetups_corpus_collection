=== Music and voice ===
Capristo has published songs in English; only for the Tabaluga project and the feature film Tangled (with Monrose) has she sung in German. She also sang the song Grace in Italian, although she does not speak that language. A complete production of their songs was used in acoustic versions. In 2016, she also released a track called "Ricorderai l'Amore (Ricorderai l'Amore)" with Italian singer Marco Mengoni, where she sung an Italian part. Capristo said, "I feel most comfortable with English, because I personally think that my voice sounds at its best. Although German is my native language, I feel more comfortable in English." In addition, she added: "It is very important that I decide my projects." In a review of the album Grace, the music magazine Laut.de wrote: "Grace is a nice debut-intentioned work, but which, unfortunately, proves that the chick from Monrose-targeted new style does not get paid on album length. [...] It Don't Matter and the acoustic session was the best, without all the trappings actually show her vocal talent." CD Bewertungen.de: "Her fans can look deep into her soul and makes clear that a lot is just smoke and mirrors as well as a "Star" has its problems, is lonely, has been violated." The British magazine Popjustice wrote: "We love it in a very deep and pure way, of course, but we were hoping Mandy's album Grace would contain so many extraordinary tunes that we could make one of them a Big Song instead. The Way I Like It gets its time in the sun after all, and that's not a completely bad thing because it is, of course, a cracker.
