== Controversy ==


=== Pfee song ===
In 2018, Ninja Lipsy made waves with "Pfee", a song she did on the Avion Riddim produced by Levels of Chillspot Records and DJ Tamuka from the Jah Prayzah lead Military Touch Productions. She dismissed rumours about the song being a political endorsement of Emerson Munangagwa[President of Zimbabwe] saying while the title was open to various interpretations, it was not political. Pfee, which is a Shona idiophone that describes sudden action, was popularised as a Zanu PF slogan. The song has attracted mixed reactions from listeners, with others saying it had political connotations, while others felt it carried sexual innuendo.
“I talk about a driver who has to be cautious on the road to avoid accidents. Others also describe the song in a sexual manner but, well, it is for the listeners to give meaning to the song.”
“We have worked together with Tamuka as a collective with other artistes, but this was the first time we worked together without anyone else. The song was his idea. He just shared the concept with me when we were in the studio. I sampled the beat, wrote the lyrics and recorded in one day,” she said.

“Other musicians shying to disclose their medical conditions need to understand that we are the people’s voice and our job is to entertain and learn at the same time. So they need to speak out and share what they go through from what they know,” said Lipsy Epilepsy is a chronic disorder of recurrent unprovoked seizures. A person is diagnosed with epilepsy if they have two unprovoked seizures (or one unprovoked seizure with the likelihood of more) that were not caused by some known and reversible medical condition like alcohol withdrawal or extremely low blood sugar.
