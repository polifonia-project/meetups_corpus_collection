== Early life ==
Mabel Alabama-Pearl McVey was born on 19 February 1996 in Alhaurín el Grande, Málaga, Spain. She is the youngest child of English music producer Cameron McVey and Swedish singer Neneh Cherry. Through her mother, Mabel is the step-granddaughter of the influential American jazz musician Don Cherry and the niece of singer Eagle-Eye Cherry. Her sister Tyson, half-sister Naima and half-brother Marlon Roudette are also singers. The family lived in Alhaurín el Grande for two years prior to Mabel's birth before relocating back to Notting Hill, West London, England, when she was age two.At age four, she taught herself to read through phonetics and audio books, but soon developed anxiety from being sensitive to her surroundings and being bullied due to racial backgrounds. Her parents—who were against the use of medication—encouraged Mabel to express herself through music and a journal. The following year, she learned piano and wrote her first song. To help manage her anxiety, the family moved to Sweden when she was eight and lived in her mother's native countryside home near the town of Hässleholm. At age 15, Mabel enrolled at the Stockholm music school Rytmus Musikergymnasiet where she took a three-year course in songwriting, production and music theory.
