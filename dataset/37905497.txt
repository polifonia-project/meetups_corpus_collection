Michael Francis Seander (born October 30, 1988), known professionally as Mike (stylized as mike.; formerly Mike Stud), is an American hip hop recording artist. His first musical recognition came with the release of his viral single "College Humor", which he recorded on GarageBand ironically while he was a relief pitcher at Duke University.


== Early life ==
In 2006, Seander graduated from St. Raphael Academy in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.  At 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m), he lettered in both baseball and basketball and was named Rhode Island's 2006 Gatorade Player of the Year, earning him an athletic scholarship to Duke University. Seander earned 2nd team all-state honors in basketball after averaging 21 points and 7 rebounds as a senior. He earned an 8-2 record with a 0.72 ERA and 88 strikeouts for the Saints as a junior. In his senior season, he posted a 9-2 record, an ERA of 0.91, and struck out 107 en route to being named both the Gatorade Player of the Year and Louisville Slugger Player of the Year in Rhode Island.


== Baseball career ==
After graduating, Seander attended Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, to play baseball. While at Duke University, he was teammates with current New York Mets pitcher Marcus Stroman, who is now generally noted as Seander's best friend. He was named the team's closer as a true freshman. Seander saved 9 games in 28 appearances and earned a 1.61 ERA (lowest in Duke baseball history). Those 9 saves were the fifth highest total in school history and was good for fourth best in the ACC that season. At season's end, Seander was named to the Louisville Slugger and Rivals.com Freshman All-American teams. The Rhode Island native also spent a summer in 2007 as the closer for the Newport Gulls in the NECBL.
Seander suffered from arm issues following his sophomore season that would eventually require Tommy John surgery. After missing the entire 2009 season recovering from the surgery, Seander graduated from Duke on the All-ACC Honor Roll with a 3.4 GPA. He decided to use his final year of college eligibility at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. He appeared in 9 games as a senior for the Hoyas, striking out 9 in 8.2 innings pitched, and earned a graduate degree in sports management.

While recovering from surgery, Stud turned to music to pass the time.In December 2010, Stud released a music video for "College Humor". Stud stated that he originally made the track as a joke for his baseball teammates. Since its release, the video has been viewed over 2.5 million times (as of April 2021). In March, Stud followed up his hit with "In This Life", which featured West Coast rapper Alex Lagemann.
