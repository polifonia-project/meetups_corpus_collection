== Career ==
Cherry Poppin' DaddiesA pianist since childhood, Lanker joined the Cherry Poppin' Daddies in early 1997 at age 20, first recording on the supplemental tracks for their compilation album Zoot Suit Riot, including the eponymous single which would later serve as the band's commercial breakthrough. Lanker briefly left the Daddies at the height of their fame in October 1998, being replaced by Johnny Goetchius of The Mighty Mighty Bosstones before returning to the band in February 2000. Lanker officially left the band in early 2012, though was able to contribute a majority of the keyboard and piano tracks for the Daddies' 2013 studio album White Teeth, Black Thoughts before his departure.

The Visible MenIn 1999, Lanker and Daddies bassist Dan Schmid formed the Eugene-based rock trio The Visible Men with a number of different drummers, where Lanker acted as pianist, lead vocalist and songwriter. During the Daddies' hiatus in the early 2000s, Lanker and Schmid focused heavily on The Visible Men, recording two albums on the Leisure King Productions label and extensively touring the western half of the United States before going on hiatus themselves in 2007. The Visible Men played a one-off reunion show in November 2009, though there has been no official announcement as to whether the group will continue recording or performing in the future.

Mad Caddies and EllwoodLanker served as a touring keyboardist for the Northern Californian ska punk band the Mad Caddies for numerous years, as well as an occasional musical collaborator, having lent organ and partial songwriting credit to the Caddies' 2007 album Keep It Going. In 2013, Lanker was added to the band's line-up as an official member.
In 2009, Lanker joined Caddies frontman Chuck Robertson's reggae side project Ellwood. In 2011, Ellwood released their debut album Lost in Transition on Fat Wreck Chords, which was followed by brief touring in the UK and US.
