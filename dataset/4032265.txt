Keeley Davis (born January 4, 1976) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter and graphic designer. He is best known as a member of the post-hardcore band At the Drive-In, with whom he has recorded one studio album, In•ter a•li•a (2017). Davis is also a former member of the rock bands Sparta and Engine Down.


== Career ==
He was the primary lead singer of the band Engine Down, in which he also played guitar. He was also in the band Denali with his sister, Maura Davis. He played bass and synthesizer.
Engine Down disbanded (under friendly circumstances) after a farewell tour in 2005, and Davis joined Sparta as lead guitarist. Davis has since recollaborated with Maura in the ambient indie rock side-project Glös, formed by him and former Engine Down drummer Cornbread Compton. Their debut album, Harmonium, was released in April 2007 on Lovitt Records. As of 2009, he is working with new band, Heks Orkest, which features longtime collaborators, Jonathon Fuller and Cam DiNinzio. As of March 2016, Davis is a touring member of At the Drive-In, following the sudden departure of guitarist and founding member Jim Ward. Since 2005, Davis has performed alongside Ward in Sparta.

== Equipment with Sparta ==

Unlike bandmate Jim Ward, Davis keeps relatively the same guitar and amp setup on each tour. All of Davis' pedals, two guitars and one amplifier were stolen when their storage facility in Los Angeles was broken into, so the equipment he performs with as of May 2007 is mostly new.
