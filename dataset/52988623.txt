In June 2016 Lahey won the Josh Pyke Partnership, for unsigned artists, which is co-sponsored by Pyke, Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) and Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society (AMCOS). She received a AUD$7500 grant, a song writing mentorship from Pyke and introduction to music industry officials. Lahey won the prize ahead of 200 entries and Pyke explained, "the song she submitted was immediately stuck in my head, and her lyrics were compelling and clever. Her turn of phrase was quirky and intelligent, and really relatable... I reckon most of us have been in the situation that's portrayed in the song 'You Don’t Think You Like People Like Me'.""You Don't Think You Like People Like Me" also received Pitchfork's Best New Track Award, and it was listed in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2016 at No. 97.

It reached No. 15 on the ARIA Albums Chart; Laura Stanley of Under the Radar observed, "[she] shares scenes from her own period of self-discovery, which makes for a fierce and incredibly fun debut full-length... the record standouts happen when Lahey and her bandmates zoom through spells of heartache with candidness and in a sharp pop-punk style."I Love You Like a Brother was placed on several albums-of-the-year lists, including Bandcamp Daily (at No. 40), Noisey, the Sydney Morning Herald, Under the Radar, BrooklynVegan, and redbull.com. Spin Magazine would also cite the album as one of the magazine's 13 "Favorite Overlooked Albums of 2017".
