Ronnie Foster (born May 12, 1950) is an American funk and soul jazz organist, and record producer.  His albums recorded for Blue Note Records in the 1970s have gained a cult following after the emergence of acid jazz.


== Early life ==
Foster was born in Buffalo, New York, on May 12, 1950. He attended Public 
School 8, Woodlawn Jr. High for a year, McKinley Vocational High School for two years, and then spent his final year at Lafayette High School. The only formal musical instruction he received was a month of accordion lessons. He was attracted to music at the age of four, took it more seriously from his early teens, and had his first professional gig aged fifteen, playing in a strip club.


== Later life and career ==
Foster initially performed with other local musicians. He moved to New York City with his own band, and acquired a publishing company. Foster has performed as a sideman with a wide range of musicians. He frequently worked with guitarist George Benson, including  playing on the guitarist's album Breezin'. Foster has also played organ with Grant Green, Grover Washington, Jr., Stanley Turrentine, Roberta Flack, Earl Klugh, Harvey Mason, Jimmy Smith, and Stevie Wonder. He is also a record producer. Ronnie Foster's song "Mystic Brew", was sampled in Electric Relaxation by A Tribe Called Quest as well as later in J. Cole's song Forbidden Fruit.
