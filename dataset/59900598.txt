Keith Rankin is an American electronic musician who records under the alias Giant Claw, a project in which the producer explores vaporwave and psychedelic music. AllMusic biographer Paul Simpson describes Rankin's music as Giant Claw as ranging "from dense sound collages and synth freak-outs to mutated prog rock and psychedelia to footwork and vaporwave". In 2010, the year Giant Claw debuted, Rankin launched the label Orange Milk with his friend Seth Graham, aiming to release records by underground American musicians. The artwork for all of the label's releases have been designed by Rankin himself. Fact Magazine have ranked the label as one of the 10 best of both 2013 and 2016.The 2014 album Dark Web was praised by Stereogum for its deconstructed sound collage style, combining dub music and beat-driven styles. He is also known to be part of vaporwave project's  Death's Dynamic Shroud.wmv founded in 2014 who had transgress established genre code's with complex edits and multiple samples. Synthesised strings formed the basis of 2016's Deep Thoughts album, which was hailed by Exclaim! for its adventurous sound. In 2017, Rankin released Soft Channel, the follow-up to Deep Thoughts. It expands upon the producer's themes of "authorship, authenticity, information overload, interruption, and cultural determinism," and was hailed by Tiny Mix Tapes as "profoundly different" to his previous works.
