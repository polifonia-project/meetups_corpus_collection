== Biography ==
Hunsberger was born August 2, 1932 in Souderton, Pennsylvania. In 1962, he was appointed conductor of the Eastman Symphony Band and coordinator of the Instrumental Ensemble Program. In 1965, following the departure of Clyde Roller, Hunsberger was appointed as conductor of the Eastman Wind Ensemble, which had been created by Frederick Fennell. During his tenure with the Eastman Wind Ensemble, Hunsberger conducted many recordings, including some with trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. Through his work as a conductor, author, and recording artist, Hunsberger helped further the principles of the wind ensemble concept, including "specified instrumentation, orchestral concept of performance, single performer approach [and] development of individual tone colors.". From 1985-87, Hunsberger served as the president of the College Band Directors National Association.
