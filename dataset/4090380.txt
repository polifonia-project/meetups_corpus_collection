=== 2006 confiscation of money by the DEA ===
On  March 3rd 2006, U.S. DEA officials confiscated more than $420,000 in American, Canadian, and Australian currencies from Keiko Fuji's carry-on luggage at JFK Airport, New York, as she waited to board a flight to Las Vegas. Keiko denied any wrongdoing, and was not charged with any crime. However, the government initiated forfeiture proceedings, seeking to seize the money, which it alleged represented proceeds of drug sales or was intended to be used to buy drugs.
Keiko disputed the government's claim. In August 2008, the matter remained pending in Federal District Court in New York. On January 27th 2009, the Federal District Court in New York ordered the confiscated money returned to her, citing lack of evidence.
