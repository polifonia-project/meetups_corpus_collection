Dúo Rey-Silva was a Chilean musical duo consisting of Alberto Rey (1915-1991) and Sergio Silva (1917-2017). Both sang while Rey played the harp and Silva the guitar. They performed principally in the cueca and tonada traditions. They also performed in Chilean motion pictures from the 1940 to the 1960s. Rey was also known for his work as a soloist on the harp. In 1996, they were honored with the designation as fundamental figures of Chilean music.
