Petty attended Tisch School of the Arts's graduate program prior to her film career. After college, Petty gathered work experience by working as an assistant to directors such as Penny Marshall, Oscar-winner Jonathan Demme, and Oscar-nominated documentary executive Jonathan Stack.
She collaborated with artist Anna Gabriel and musician Howie Statland on a site-specific installation at New York’s modern art gallery PS1, a division of the Museum of Modern Art in 1998; the group called themselves "Low Flame." The installation detailed the life of a lonely garbage man that built friends out of garbage.Petty has worked with various recording artists to develop visual campaigns in print, video and new media. Petty has directed videos for artists such as Regina Spektor, Beyoncé,  Coldplay & Rihanna, Kings of Leon, Macy Gray, Corinne Bailey Rae, Duffy, The Duke Spirit, The Veronicas, and Mat Kearney.

While working at Sire, she most notably created signature marketing campaigns and videos for Regina Spektor.
Her first documentary was a film about Paris Hilton, Paris, Not France, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2008. Her second documentary film, "Regina Spektor: Live in London", debuted in 2010 in the United States with a limited theatrical release.
In 2011, Petty released the short film NU-6 which was inspired by a hearing exam she had to take after suffering from two ruptured ear drums. The film was shot in a day.Petty was nominated for five MTV Video Music Awards for videos for  Beyoncé’s "Countdown," Coldplay and Rihanna’s "Princess of China" and Regina Spektor's "All the Rowboats" in 2012.
