Ron Haydock (April 17, 1940, Chicago, Illinois – August 14, 1977, Victorville, California) was an American actor, screenwriter, novelist and rock musician.


== Career ==
Haydock's band, Ron Haydock and the Boppers, were heavily influenced by Gene Vincent. In August 1959, Cha Cha Records released their debut single, "99 Chicks"/"Be-Bop-A Jean." These tunes and 26 other tracks were reissued by Norton Records on the 1996 CD 99 Chicks, which had a vinyl release in 2005.
In the Hollywood B-movie industry, Haydock was an actor and screenwriter, working with director Ray Dennis Steckler. He also worked as a magazine editor. Haydock used a variety of pseudonyms, including Arnold Hayes, Lonnie Lord, Vin Saxon, Don Sheppard and Jerry Lee Vincent. As Vin Saxon, he was the author of adult fiction paperbacks during the 1960s and 1970s. As Arnold Hayes, he wrote graphic stories for Warren Publishing. Haydock was allegedly responsible for discovering actor Edgar Aghassi and setting him on a career in cult horror films.
In 1966, Haydock, suffering from depression, moved back to Chicago. In 1967, he recorded nearly a dozen acoustic demos. Through the 1970s he wrote more novels and comics, and returned to acting.
On August 14, 1977, Haydock was struck and killed by a truck while hitchhiking after visiting Steckler in Las Vegas; he was 37. Coincidentally, his death happened two days before that of his idol, Elvis Presley.
Norton Records' Miriam Linna has written extensively about Haydock for liner notes, magazine articles and the book Sin-A-Rama (2004).
