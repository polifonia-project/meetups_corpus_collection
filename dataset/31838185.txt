I'm in the throes of writing a musical version of It's a Wonderful Life right now, working with Kathie Lee Gifford, who's doing the lyrics. I find we're mostly writing to character: Is it George, or the old guy who runs the bank? What do they want, what are they trying to do, what is the mood of thatâ€”is it staccato, are they agitated, is it a ballad?
