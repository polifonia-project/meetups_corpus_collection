== Music career ==


=== The Strangeloves ===
Goldstein was a member of the band The Strangeloves along with Bob Feldman and Richard Gottehrer, responsible for the hit song "I Want Candy."
The band formed in 1964 under a fictionalized origins story, pretending to be three musical brothers (named Giles, Miles and Niles) raised on an Australian sheep farm. "I Want Candy" reached as high as #11 on the US Hot 100 and #7 on the Canada RPM 100 lists.The Strangeloves' only LP, I Want Candy, was released in 1965 on Bert Berns' songwriter label Bang Records, with several of the album songs having been released as singles. Other singles by The Strangeloves appeared on Swan Records and Sire Records.In early 1966, the lineup was replaced by guitarist Jack Raczka (Giles Strange), drummer-vocalist Joe Piazza (Miles Strange), and keyboardist-vocalist Ken Jones (Niles Strange). In 1968, bass player Greg Roman became an integral part of the band.


=== The McCoys ===
While with The Strangeloves, Goldstein contributed to bringing The McCoys aboard Bang Records. The McCoys sang over the original recording for "I Want Candy" to record a brand new hit, "Hang On Sloopy", which was originally earmarked for a Strangeloves album. Both groups went on tour that summer, starting with The McCoys supporting The Strangeloves; by the end of the tour, "Sloopy" had reached #1 and The McCoys were the headliners.


=== Sly Stone ===
Goldstein signed Sly Stone to a management deal in 1989, hoping to revive the faded flame of his career.
The two, along with Goldstein's colleague Glenn Stone (no relation to Sly), formed Even Street Productions. In 2002, they renegotiated his Sly and the Family Stone record deal with Sony which gave birth to a reissue of the catalog, a box set (The Collection) and Different Strokes by Different Folks, a remix and the all-star remix and cover album paying tribute to the music of Sly and the Family Stone.
While the collaboration did help Stone resurface in the public eye for a time, the deal ended sourly, with both Stone and Goldstein taking legal action against the other over millions of dollars in royalties. In January 2015 Stone was awarded $5 million in damages, $2.45 million of that against Goldstein.  This award was entirely reversed by the court on October 4, 2016.


=== WAR (1969-current) ===
Goldstein has produced every album in WAR’s catalog dating back to Eric Burdon Declares ‘WAR’ in 1970, which included the chart-topping hit "Spill The Wine".In 1969, Goldstein saw musicians who would eventually become WAR playing at the Rag Doll in North Hollywood, backing Deacon Jones, and he was attracted to the band's sound. Band member Leroy "Lonnie" Jordan" claimed that the band's goal was to spread a message of brotherhood and harmony, using instruments and voices to speak out against racism, hunger, gangs, crime, and promote hope and the spirit of brotherhood.The group had an extensive run of hits from 1971 until 1977 with United Artists Records, including five million-sellers. "Low Rider" was a #1 R&B hit in 1975, while "The Cisco Kid" reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1973.
The band WAR disbanded and four of the original members left the band WAR and formed the Lowrider Band.  Jerry Goldstein took them to court and sued for rights to the name of the band and won so now there is the band WAR with only Lonnie as the original band member. All other original band members and songwriters are in the Lowrider Band.
