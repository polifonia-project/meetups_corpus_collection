== Biography ==
Joshua "Josh" Hedley was born and raised in Naples, Florida. He felt "inexplicably drawn" to the fiddle as a child, requesting one by name from his parents at 3. He got his first violin at 8. By 12, he was playing with "middle-aged pickers" at the local VFW. Hedley credits the "ear training" he received through learning the fiddle early in life has helped him become a better singer.When he turned 19, he moved to Nashville where he became an "in-demand sideman" at Robert's Western World and other venues. He became known around the Lower Broad district of Nashville – where he developed his sound. "I always thought Josh was the best thing going on down on Broadway," says Margo Price, who used Hedley's fiddle on All American Made. "No one carries on the tradition the way Ol’ Hed does. He grew up in it, worked on his chops and earned his place in that world. Now the world gets to hear it."He became known as "Mr. Jukebox" while playing down on Broad "thanks to Hedley's pristine vocals, unrivaled musicianship, and truly encyclopedic knowledge of country music." He's toured with artists such as Jonny Fritz, Justin Townes Earle, Willie Watson, and others. He was featured in the 2015 documentary Heartworn Highways Revisited. Hedley was listed as one of ten country music acts to watch by Rolling Stone magazine in November 2016.Hedley was featured on an online variety show hosted by Ketch Secor of Old Crow Medicine Show on YouTube Live. The series has also featured Charlie Worsham and Molly Tuttle.


=== Sobriety ===
Hedley started writing his own songs after getting sober. As he says of this change in his life:
Sobriety led to ideas. Before that, I really wasn't interested in anything other than getting drunk. And the idea of writing a song never even crossed my mind. I had written a couple of them on the spur of the moment. But once I got sober, it opened up a door in my brain to where all these ideas were. They just kept coming. I couldn't write them fast enough.


=== Livestreaming ===
On March 17, 2020, Hedley and his group the Hedliners, together with Dave Cox, played their first livestreamed show at Robert's Western World, where he'd performed "thousands of times" since 2005. Playing to an empty dance floor, after area bars and music venues were shut down in response to the COVID-19 virus threat, Hedley and his musicians made more in virtual Venmo and PayPal tips from fans worldwide than they would on a regular night at the venue.
The performance garnered 53,000 views online within a few days, far more exposure than the 200-fan maximum venue could generate on a given night.


=== Festivals ===
Hedley headlined the ISOL-AID festival with Leah Flanagan and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy in May 2020.


== Mr. Jukebox ==
Hedley released his debut album Mr. Jukebox in 2018. It was named for his "uncanny ability to perform nearly any classic-country song thrown his way."

When You Wish Upon a Star (2:59)Hedley selected the only cover on the album, his final track version of "When You Wish Upon a Star", to honor his father, who died before seeing his son succeed in music. As the grateful son says, "We spent a lot of Christmases at Disney World. When I was searching for a cover song, it dawned on me that my dad didn't get to see any of this happen, but he always wanted it."Hedley says of the type of music he wants to make, and where that fits him in the Nashville music scene:
I would love to be part of the Music City machine as long as I get to keep making the music that I want to make. Bring me in, Music Row. If the machine wants to hear sad fucking ballads about heartbreak with a lot of steel guitar and some strings, then I’ll be a cog in that machine.


=== Reception ===
Hedley is driven by a similar goal: to make music that honors tradition in a personal and heartfelt way.Hedley's got a voice that could sing the phonebook and make it sound like a Sixties gem straight from Billy Sherrill's lost 1960s archives . .Hedley, an old-school country singer, songwriter and fiddler whose sound recalls Johnny Paycheck and Merle Haggard, has spent years paying his dues in Nashville. Now it's time for the rest of the world to take notice.


== Tours ==
Hedley has toured with Jonny Fritz, Justin Townes Earle, Willie Watson, and others.


== Style ==
Hedley has said that country music was perfected in 1965, a statement he admits "was a bit hyperbolic." He continues:
Honestly, it's just my favorite era. Country music seems to change every 10 years or so and that Nashville Sound being pioneered by guys like Chet Atkins, Owen Bradley and Billy Sherrill just really speaks to me. But there are things I like about all eras of country music from Jimmie Rodgers to Ronnie Milsap. And my favorites change all the time, I just seem to be firmly planted in the Nashville Sound lately.
