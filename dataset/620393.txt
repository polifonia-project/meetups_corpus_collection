== Life and career ==


=== 1979–1994: Early career and TM Network ===

His career started as a keyboardist for Speedway in 1979. In 1984, he created the TM Network with Takashi Utsunomiya and Naoto Kine. A year later, in 1985, his first solo work was the soundtrack Vampire Hunter D for the anime movie Vampire Hunter D, and his band, TM Network, did the closing credits song "Your Song". He subsequently composed other soundtracks such as Heaven and Earth and Seven Days War.
As a solo singer, Komuro released singles "Running to Horizon" and "Gravity of Love" in 1989. "Running to Horizon" topped the Oricon charts. "Gravity of Love" also topped the Oricon charts, beating out Seiko Matsuda's "Precious Heart". In 1989 and 1990, Komuro collaborated with Warren Cuccurullo.
As a composer and producer, Komuro wrote a song "My Revolution" for Misato Watanabe. The song received the Golden Award at 28th Japan Record Awards in 1986.
TM Network released single "The Point of Lovers' Night" on July 7, 1990. The single also topped the Oricon weekly charts, beating out Wink's single "Yoru ni Hagurete (Where Were You Last Night)".TM Network changed its name to TMN in 1990. In 1991, he collaborated with X Japan drummer and pianist Yoshiki as V2. TMN disbanded in 1994.


=== 1994–1997: Success as a record producer ===
By the early 1990s, Komuro was spending much of his time writing songs for and producing many other musicians and bands. He was also an early pioneer of dance music in Japan, and came to stardom in the 1990s as producer with a long string of hits with artists such as TRF (TK Rave Factory), Tomomi Kahala, Namie Amuro, Ami Suzuki, hitomi, Ryoko Shinohara and H Jungle with t. In 1994, he composed the musical score to the Japanese anime film Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, based on the Capcom video game. Ryōko Shinohara recorded the theme song of the anime film, "Itoshisa to Setsunasa to Kokoro Zuyosa to", with Tetsuya Komuro. The single of the theme song was released on July 21, 1994, and sold over two million copies on Oricon charts. This score was removed from the US release of the film.
He was mainly helped in this task by the mix engineers Pete Hammond and Dave Ford. Both were working for PWL, which was the home of the British producing team Stock Aitken Waterman. Not only that, "TK" is also credited for the rise to fame of Daisuke Asakura, a popular Japanese composer, keyboardist and music producer who began his major musical career as a backup keyboardist for TM Network. Asakura is reported to view Komuro as his "Sensei" or "Teacher".
In 1997, he started his overseas career with the remix of the theme music for the soundtrack to the 1997 American film Speed 2: Cruise Control, which Japanese MMA fighter Kazushi Sakuraba and English pro wrestler Johnny Smith later adopted as their entrance music.


=== 1998–2007: Following career ===

Komuro also released albums as a solo singer or musician and was involved in the bands Globe, Kiss Destination and Gaball. On December 31, 1998, his band Globe's song "Wanna Be A Dreammaker" received the grand prix award at the 40th edition of Japan Record Award. In 1999, Komuro, Utsunomiya and Kine reunited under their old name of TM Network, and remain active to this day.
Komuro worked in collaboration with French keyboardist Jean Michel Jarre from 1998 to 2001. The duet wrote the theme song for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, "Together Now", as well as several other tracks and remixes. He and Jarre also performed a concert on beaches in Okinawa on January 1, 2001.


=== 2008: Fraud ===
On November 4, 2008, Komuro was arrested and charged with fraud, for taking ¥500,000,000 in exchange for a promise to sell to a Hyōgo-based investor the copyright to his songs, which he had already sold to somebody else (which was Avex Group Holdings according to reports). Reportedly, he planned to use the money to pay a portion of his ex-wife's alimony. He admitted the fraud at his trial in January 2009.In March 2009, Matsuura Masato, president of the Avex Group Holdings, recovered the losses for the plaintiff, paid him extra ¥100 million in compensation and a further ¥48 million in delay damages. Matsuura also stated that Komuro will work at Avex in a company position directly under his control.On May 11, 2009, Komuro received a suspended three-year prison sentence. According to the sentencing judge, Komuro's acceptance of responsibility and the fact that restitution had been made greatly influenced the final sentence, and further went on to state that no good to society would come from Komuro's imprisonment.


=== 2009–2020: Comeback ===
At the Avex Group Holdings' concert tour a-nation 2009, Komuro made a surprise appearance on August 22, 2009. He played a medley of his hit songs at the piano and later reunited on stage with his fellow members of the J-pop group globe, Marc Panther and his wife Keiko.
Komuro composed AAA's double A-side single "Aitai Riyū/Dream After Dream (Yume Kara Sameta Yume)". The single was released on May 5, 2010.
He composed almost all the songs on Love Songs, the 2010 album of Japanese pop-star Ayumi Hamasaki.  He also composed the 2013 single "Feel The Love" by Ayumi Hamasaki.In January 2018, Komuro announced his retirement from the music industry, following revelations of an affair he had with a nurse who had been taking care of his wife Keiko after her brain surgery.In July 2020, Komuro once again returned to the industry producing singles for Ayumi Hamasaki & Nogizaka46. It was speculated that Komuro's return was financially motivated; since the fraud controversy, Komuro has had financial difficulties. During much of 2019 and 2020, it was reported that negotiations between him and Keiko for a divorce settlement were underway, although nothing official was ever reported.
in February 2021, it was reported that Keiko's divorce had been finalized.
