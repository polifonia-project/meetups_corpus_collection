"Havalar Nasıl", "İşte Hayat", "Son Selam", "Ayrılık Akşamı", "Sen Bilirsin", and "Bal Ağızlım" all became number-one hits on music charts.


=== 1980s ===
In his own words, İrem decided to stay away from " the insincere people and meaningless crowds" and from "the popular culture that deals more with shapes rather than what people produce".His search for a music style initiated with the theme of sadness in his songs in the '70s to the theme of peace and metaphysics in '80s. During that period he also wrote a rock symphony. After the publication of "Bezgin" which consisted of his compositions in 1981, he released the symphonic rock trilogy, which was the product of a seven-year work in 1983, and was prepared in three separate albums Pencere (1983), Köprü(1985), and Ve Ötesi (1987).

In 1987, the final album from his trilogy Ve Ötesi and a second book titled Uzaklarda Biri Var were released. They were followed by the albums Dünden Yarına, and Uçun Kuşlar Uçun, which was released in 1989.
