== Childhood ==
"Jason Russo grew up in a religious household with two brothers, a sister and no TV. The son of a psychiatrist, he spent the better part of his youth in graveyards, woods and strip malls in upstate New York before music consumed much of his life. At the age of 19, Russo found himself touring alongside his brother Justin as bassist for critically acclaimed Mercury Rev during the band's peak, before moving on to focus entirely on his own eclectic psychedelic rock band Hopewell. - NY Post".
