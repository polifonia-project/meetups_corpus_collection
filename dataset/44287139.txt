After the war, "Scott accompanied the comedian Sid Field in Piccadilly Hayride (Prince of Wales Theatre 1946) and worked as a stooge with Terry-Thomas." Scott was then known "for his poise and deadpan humour", according to his obituary in The Stage.In July 1948, he formed a short-lived double act with Tony Hancock in a show billed as Hank and Scott which appeared at the Windmill Theatre. Harry Worth and Morecambe and Wise appeared on the same show but the latter were deemed "unfunny" at the time. Hank and Scott made their only TV appearance in New To You (1948). Scott would later compose the music for The Punch and Judy Man, and the music for Hancock, the comedian's series for ATV broadcast in 1963.Scott directed two Royal Variety Shows and was music director for West End shows such as Kiss Me, Kate, Kismet and Brigadoon.
