== Early life ==
Supa Bwe was raised by his English-born mother who is Black, Native American and Scottish. He attributes his music education to the music she exposed him to as a young child, including Punk and Metal bands such as Rage Against the Machine and Korn. His father is attributed with introducing him to Hip Hop.â€‰ In an August 2016 interview in XXL Magazine he described the effect of these early influences, "I grew up listening to a wide array of music. My mom is from the United Kingdom and my dad is from the projects. I got a lot of punk influences and alternative rock, a lot of things from the 1990s. My pop, all that hood [stuff]. He loves Master P, Busta Rhymes, [stuff] like that. I got an introduction to both worlds."
