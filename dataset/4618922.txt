=== Personal life ===
He was born in Delano, California and grew up in the area. His brothers worked at a fast food stand, and behind the stand was a jukebox. As a boy, he would sing along with it. He would memorize songs heard on the jukebox by artists such as Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Fats Domino. Later he moved to Los Angeles. He was schooled at Salesian and Garfield High Schools.


=== Music career ===
He started singing professionally in the late 1950s. His first single, "There Is Something On Your Mind," was released on Dore Records in or around 1960. In 1962, with backing band The Premiers, he recorded a live single, "Shake, Shout And Soul," which was recorded at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. The single was backed with "Soul & Stomp," and released on Tony Hilder's Impact Records label. 

Thee MidnightersAnother single he recorded for Hilder's Impact label was "Loretta," backed with "My Girl." This one was released under the name of Lil' Ray & Thee Midniters. For a brief period of time, he was the lead singer for Thee Midnighters. In 1964, Jimenez left the group, (and was replaced as lead singer by Willie Garcia, a.k.a. "Little Willie G.").
Post 1964In 1965, he recorded a single for the Donna label. The A side was "I Have Nothing," and the B side, "I Been Trying," was written by Arthur Lee, who went on to form the group Love. Lee was also the producer. "I Have Nothing" also appears on the 1997 compilation, Black Beauty & Rarities, which is a compilation of early recordings by Arthur Lee, Ronnie & The Pomona Casuals, and other related artists, (including Little Ray).
For a brief period, he and Thee Midnighters singer Willie Garcia formed a group called God's Children. They would record the theme song for the short lived TV series Matt Lincoln, "Hey, Who Really Cares" (aka "Hey, Does Somebody Care"), written by Oliver Nelson and Linda Perhacs.
