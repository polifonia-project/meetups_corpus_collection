George Ramirez was born on July 31, 1994, in Atlanta, Georgia, the youngest of seven children. His parents hail from San Marcos, Guerrero in Mexico and emigrated to Long Beach in the late 1980s. The Ramirez family lived there until George’s father had migrated to Atlanta for work. An older brother was also affiliated with a gang so George’s mother ultimately decided to follow, landing in College Park, Georgia, a suburb in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area where he would be born and raised. Kap G graduated from Tri-Cities High School.

He released his debut single, titled "Tatted Like Amigos"; a collaboration with Chicago rapper Chief Keef, which garnered him mainstream attention.
