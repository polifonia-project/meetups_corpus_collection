=== Musical style and songwriting ===
Banos' musical style blends elements of bossa nova and indie pop. Suzy Exposito from Rolling Stone described his music as "psychedelia-soaked love ballads". Brett Calwood told LA Weekly that Banos's music has "smooth Latin influences with a nostalgic lean". Banos blends English and Spanish lyrics over what he describes as "alternative dream pop" melodies that have "a lot of synthesizers" and "a lot of 808's".


=== Influences ===
Banos grew up listening to Chicano rap from names such as Lil Rob, Baby Bash and MC Magic, as well as Spanish rock, boleros and other old ballads that his parents would play around the house. He listens to jazz, classical music and trap music, and has cited Kevin Parker of Tame Impala and Ariel Pink as some of his major musical influences. In an interview with Jesse Thorn from Bullseye, Banos described how the song, "Feels Like We Only Go Backwards"  by Tame Impala helped him with visualizing his career in music and navigating his life in high school.
