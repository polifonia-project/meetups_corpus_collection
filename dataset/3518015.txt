Dan Brereton attended the California College of the Arts and the Academy of Art College. He stated in a 2014 interview that "One of earliest memories of drawing monsters is from kindergarten. Our teacher asked us one afternoon what we wanted to do with the hour we had left in class and I yelled out, 'Let’s draw monsters!'...So to my mind, anyway, monsters are the purest product of our imaginations, whether they be good or bad or just plain wild. That idea never ceases to inspire me and find its way into my work."
