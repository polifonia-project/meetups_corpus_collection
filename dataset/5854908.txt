"Take Good Care of Her" reached No. 38 in the UK Singles Chart in June 1961. Wade's vocal style was generally compared to that of his contemporary Johnny Mathis. But it was actually a singer from an earlier period, Nat King Cole, who was his principal influence.

He was my idol since high school."In 1975, Wade become the first African-American to host a television game show, with the premiere of Musical Chairs.
