The year after, in 1992, he released his only album, Summer Time Memories, before disappearing from the scene altogether. He later moved to Hawaii.In the 2017 science fiction novel Honor's Reserve by Michael La Ronn, the character Grayson McCoy is named after Joey McCoy after finding out about the band from his uncle, who was a band manager. He stated that "he brought up a crate from the basement, and on the very top I saw this CD–it was a Japanese band... and in the middle of four Japanese guys was a black guy. I was intrigued."
