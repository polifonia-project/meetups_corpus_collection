She attended Yale University but later transferred to The Juilliard School, where she earned BM ('77) and MM ('78) degrees in violin. While studying at Juilliard, Alsop played with orchestras such as the New York Philharmonic and the New York City Ballet. She founded the string ensemble String Fever in 1981.

== Early career ==
Alsop was music director of the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music from 1992 to 2016. From 1993 to 2005, she was first principal conductor and then music director of the Colorado Symphony. She is now the orchestra's conductor laureate.

== Baltimore Symphony Orchestra ==
In September 2007, Alsop was appointed the 12th music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO), having been named Music Director Designate for the 2006–2007 concert season. Selecting her was noteworthy because Alsop is the first woman to hold this position with a major American orchestra. The initial controversy surrounding the announcement that she would be the BSO's next Music Director stemmed from significant resistance from the orchestra's players, who insisted they had not had enough voice in the search process. The orchestra and Alsop met after the announcement and apparently smoothed over some of their differences. In June 2009, the orchestra announced the extension of her contract for another five years, through August 2015.  In July 2013, the BSO announced a further extension of her contract as music director through the 2020–2021 season.  In February 2020, the Baltimore Symphony announced that Alsop is to conclude her music directorship of the orchestra at the close of the 2020–2021 season, and to take the title of Music Director Laureate.Alsop's initiatives with the Baltimore SO have included the "Webumentary Film Series", a free iTunes podcast, "Clueless About Classical", and the "OrchKids" programme, the last directed at underprivileged Baltimore children and based on Venezuela's El Sistema program. Alsop was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2008.  In August 2015, Alsop was appointed Director of Graduate Conducting at the Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University, succeeding one of her mentors, Gustav Meier.

Since 1990, Alsop's partner has been Kristin Jurkscheit, a horn player. They have a son, and Alsop has spoken publicly about her family.
