In 1981, they moved to Sugar Hill Records along with another Enjoy Records act Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The Treacherous Three became well known for their singles "Feel the Heartbeat" and "Whip It". They released their debut full-length album and were featured in the 1984 film the breakdance cult-movie Beat Street performing the song "Xmas Rap" with Doug E.
