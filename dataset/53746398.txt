His 2004 release of "Süssholz" went to the top of the German DJ charts. It was followed by another hit in 2005 titled 'Ihre persönliche Glücksmelodie', and then 'Doppelwhipper' in 2006.
In 2008, Ananda founded his own record label, Basmati, as a place where he can release his own productions. And by the end of 2011, Basmati celebrated its 9th release, eight of those from Ananda.In 2015, he played at the Welcome to the Future festival in the Netherlands.
