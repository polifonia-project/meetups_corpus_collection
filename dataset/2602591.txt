== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Born in Beckenham, Heyward spent his early years in and around south London. He attended Kelsey Park School for Boys where he studied art and photography. He left school at 16 to work as a commercial artist.


=== Haircut One Hundred ===
Heyward and school friends Graham Jones and Les Nemes, the core of Haircut One Hundred, started bands together as far back as 1977. They were first known as Rugby, then the Boat Party, Captain Pennyworth and Moving England, before settling on Haircut One Hundred. The band signed with Arista Records in 1981 and had four UK top 10 singles between 1981 and 1982. Their debut album, Pelican West (1982), written by Heyward, reached No. 2. It was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry.
Work on the band's second album commenced in October 1982 but, in January 1983, a statement was issued confirming that Heyward had left the band, and percussionist Marc Fox had taken over on vocals. At the time of the announcement, Heyward told Smash Hits magazine that he had been contemplating going solo for a while and had already recorded some tracks with session musicians. However, many years later, Heyward stated that he had been struggling with stress and depression at the time after a year of constant work and pressure which led to him being, in effect, sacked by the other members of the band.Over the years, the band has reformed several times. Though not performing together as of 2017, Heyward described a "deep love" for the band and remarked that "the door is always open". In an interview with Lorraine, he said he was "ever hopeful" that the band would one day play a reunion show at the Roundhouse where Pelican West was recorded.

Heyward's solo career began in March 1983 with the single "Whistle Down the Wind", which reached No. 13 on the UK Singles Chart.

His debut solo album, North of a Miracle, was released in October 1983 and peaked at No. 10 in the UK.
