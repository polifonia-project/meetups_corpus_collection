His participation in the Pardon My French collective suggests he is French, as all other members are.


== Identity ==
Malaa's identity is unknown. It is strongly suggested that Malaa consists of a duo with DJs DJ Snake and Tchami, as they are credited often on each other's track productions and are connected to the project via remixes. It is also speculated that French DJ Mercer is involved in Malaa, since the same management team is shared between the three artists.  Through a Reddit post made on the topic, Redditors discovered a tweet on Twitter where a user wrote "cant believe im opening for dj snake + tchami's side project next thursday", while linking to a SoundCloud mix by Malaa. The tweet was then favourited by DJ Snake's Twitter account, which hints his participation on the topic. French DJ Sebastien Benett is also speculated to be Malaa, due to the quick removal of a Facebook comment from Mercer's profile which stated that Malaa was a nickname of Benett and that the last posts by Benett on SoundCloud coincide with the first appearances of Malaa. Both have also been seen individually smoking cigarettes frequently.
