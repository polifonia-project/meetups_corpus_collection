Joey Stann is an accomplished saxophonist who has worked as a sideman and has recorded with a long list of rock and roll luminaries. Stann performs primarily on the tenor, Alto saxophone and baritone saxophone and has contributed  vocals and has played and recorded the Hammond organ and piano on stage and in studios. A New York native, he is recognized for his lifelong association with Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes. Stann originally joined the band in 1980. He left to play with Gary U.S. Bonds from 1981 to 1985 before rejoining Southside Johnny. He currently freelances with other bands.
Also Joseph "Holistic Life Master" is an Integrative Energy Healer, Shaman, Reiki Master, Certified Clinical Hypnotherapist, Intuitive, Teacher, and Paranormal Investigator. Joseph’s interest in Holistic Healing began in the late 1960s, is organic, and was born out of personal experiences.  At age 12, he had suffered a heart attack as a result of a cardiac birth defect. Several years later, early in his career as a professional musician, he began to experience painful arthritis which threatened his ability to perform, as well as making the rigors of touring more difficult. After unsuccessful attempts with traditional medicine, Joseph turned to Holistic Healing and successfully healed both his arthritis as well as his heart condition.
