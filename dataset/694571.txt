Ceephax Acid Crew (real name Andy Jenkinson) is a British electronic musician and record producer who works primarily in the acid house and drum and bass subgenres. Jenkinson is also known simply by the pseudonym Ceephax, which is a reference to the BBC teletext service Ceefax. He is the brother of Squarepusher (Tom Jenkinson).


== Music and career ==
Ceephax's music from 1997 to 2002 and beyond used mainly vintage (especially Roland) drum machines and synthesizers such as the TB-303. This music was often recorded onto a cassette tape deck. The music was released on vinyl records and cassette tape on underground labels such as Breakin' Records, Lo Recordings and Firstcask. This primitive Acid House aesthetic and methodology countered the growing popularity of the computer music and compact disc releases of the time. 
Rephlex Records and Warp Records also released remixes of Squarepusher by Ceephax around this time.
From 2003 onwards as well as his more typical Acid style he has also released drum and bass songs made on old samplers, a Commodore Amiga and various early digital synthesizers, again displaying an interest in late 1980s and early 1990s dance music. His set on Mary Anne Hobb's show Breezeblock in 2003 and more recent tracks such as "Castilian" and "Arcadian" also indicate an interest in Chiptune music.
From 2007 he has had full releases on the Rephlex and Planet Mu record labels. He also continues to release on Firstcask and other small independent labels such as WéMè, Bugklinik and his own label Waltzer.
Ceephax's live shows are set apart from the popular laptop style of live electronic performance by exclusively using only analogue and early digital equipment and occasionally an Amiga computer. Hardware frequently used include a TB-303, TR-909, TR-707, SH-101, Kenton Pro-2000, and Yamaha RS7000. These sets range from old school house, acid house, techno, drum and bass and gabber all in Ceephax's distinctive style. He has also produced several music videos predominantly using old video equipment and early computer animation.
