Together with Efrim Menuck and Mauro Pezzente, Moya formed Godspeed You! Black Emperor in the early 1990s.  He contributed guitar to the band's 1997 debut album F♯A♯∞ and their follow-up EP Slow Riot for New Zerø Kanada, but left the group in 1998, before the EP was released.  Additionally, his vocals can be heard in the opening moments of the song "Antennas to Heaven," from the group's 2000 release Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven. Moya has been participating in the band's reunion.
