Giggs was convicted for possession of a firearm in 2003, and sentenced to two years eight months in prison. In February 2012, police searched a car Giggs was in and found an illegal firearm; Giggs spent six months remanded in custody, despite the driver admitting to owning the gun, as police accused Giggs of being aware of the firearm. Giggs was acquitted on all charges.Giggs often experienced venues cancelling events he was scheduled to appear at mere hours before the performance. Giggs was dropped as support act for Lil Wayne before a 2006 tour without explanation. These incidents have been linked to actions of the Metropolitan Police Service, who have been said to have specifically targeted Giggs. Giggs believes that they "must have called the venues and threatened them with taking away their licences". In 2010, he said that "every single thing I do that's supposed to be positive, they fuck up for me". In 2013, he stated: "I don't want to get caught up in whose fault it is, or whether the police are after me [...] I'm just happy to be making music again".In 2009, the Metropolitan Police wrote to XL strongly advising the label not to sign Giggs, though they did anyway. A 2010 tour planned by Giggs was cancelled due to police warnings. In 2013, Giggs' London performance of material from When Will It Stop was cancelled by police, after they had given him the go-ahead. Giggs responded in a video publicly apologising to fans, reimbursing them for tickets, and sarcastically praising the police's attempts to "slow [him] down".
