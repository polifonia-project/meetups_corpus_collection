Berger studied experimental psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. He took part in the recording of some documentaries for radio about the opposition to Vietnam. Through this work, he got a job in the South focused on the civil rights of workers. He spent nine months in New Orleans making the film.  When he returned to Berkeley, he started to realize that his filming experience was more interesting than his studies and he found a job recording sound for a documentary on the programs of the U.S. Agency for International Development [USAID]. He visited 11 countries in the course of 7 days.

When Berger returned and got in touch with Murch he was offered the job of working on The Godfather, Part II.  This was his first job in feature film.
