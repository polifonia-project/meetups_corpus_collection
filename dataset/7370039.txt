Peter "Peavy" Wagner (born 22 December 1964) is a German heavy metal musician best known as the lead singer and bassist of Rage.


== Biography ==
Wagner was born in Herne, North Rhine-Westphalia, the second of four children. His parents, both passionate amateur musicians, tried to inspire their kids for music since childhood. Eventually, Wagner learned his first instrument, the classical guitar. He started to play on the electrical guitar a few years later and, inspired by Lemmy from Motörhead, finally switched to the electric bass in the early 1980s.
In 1983, Wagner founded together with the two guitar players Jochen Schroeder and Alf Meyerratken the heavy metal band Avenger. In 1986, the band's name was changed to Rage. Wagner is the only member of the band to have stayed in it throughout its history. He currently performs as the band's bassist and singer.
Wagner also participated in Mekong Delta's two first albums, appeared on Axel Rudi Pell's Black Moon Pyramid as a guest bass player, and participated in Markus Grosskopf's project Bassinvaders.
