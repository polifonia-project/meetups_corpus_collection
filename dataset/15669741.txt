In early 2014, Gordon formed a quintet called The Righteous Young, of which she is the lead singer. However, she clarified in a Q&A on Facebook that The Righteous Young does not mean the end of Wynter Gordon as a solo act, but is rather an extension of her own music. "The Righteous Young is my band ... My music, WYNTER and THE RIGHTEOUS YOUNG". She released her first single with The Righteous Young, "Everything Burns", on June 3, 2014. The music video, directed by Harrison Boyce, was exclusively released on Idolator and Vevo on the same day.

=== 2016: Co-writing and producing with Beyoncé ===
On April 23, 2016, Beyoncé released her sixth album Lemonade featuring several tracks where Diana Gordon (credited with her real name, and not her stage name) received a writing and producing credit, including "Don't Hurt Yourself" (which also samples Led Zeppelin's "When the Levee Breaks"), "Sorry", and "Daddy Lessons". A few months after the release of Lemonade, on July 22, 2016, Gordon announced that she was no longer using her stage name Wynter Gordon. Instead, she decided to be going by her birth name, Diana Gordon. On July 25, 2016, Diana Gordon shared her first single under her own name, "The Legend Of". Her first EP released under her own name and titled, Pure, was released on August 3, 2018. In a capsule review for Vice, Robert Christgau gave the EP a three-star honorable mention () and summed it up as "five proofs of a Beyoncé cowriter's hard-won, unembittered self-reliance—too modest to be 'inspirational,' and stronger for it"; the tracks "Wolverine" and "Too Young" were cited as highlights. On April 3, 2020, Gordon released a new eight track EP called Wasted Youth featuring acoustic versions of "Rollin" and "Once A Friend."
