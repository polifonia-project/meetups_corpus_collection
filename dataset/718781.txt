== Career ==


=== The Modern Lovers ===
In 1972 Jerry met Jonathan Richman, and they formed The Modern Lovers. Harrison was introduced to Richman by mutual friend and journalist Danny Fields and the pair bonded over their shared love of the Velvet Underground. He joined The Modern Lovers in early 1971, playing on their debut album in 1972 in California (not released until 1976 and produced by John Cale), and left in February 1974, when Richman wished to perform his songs more quietly. After the breakup of the band, Harrison was devastated, he returned to Harvard to get his Masters degree in architecture.


=== Talking Heads ===
Harrison joined Talking Heads in 1977, after the release of their debut single "Love → Building on Fire". Jerry got the offer to join the band in 1976, while he was still studying at university. Tina Weymouth phoned Jerry directly asking him to come and see the Talking Heads play in Boston, not knowing he had already seen them before and had been merely impressed by their material. After the performance, Harrison did not give a precise answer about whether he would join the line-up. One thing was clear- if he did, the band would have to wait until he graduated. In September of 1976, Jerry told Tina he would come to New York City to jam with the band, he did not have enough money to take a bus, so he helped his friend Ernie Brooks move to NYC in a van, there was no place for a keyboard or an organ, so he ended up only bringing his guitar, which he learned to play three years earlier because he was fed up with Jonathan Richman’s guitar playing. After a lot of consideration, Jerry decided to join the band. Jerry was aware that a few longtime Talking Heads fans resented his presence at first, but with time after more and more gigs he made the band sound complete. During this time he lived with Chris Frantz, Tina Weymouth and her brother Yann in Long Island. Harrison was the one to come up with the idea of the cover of the 1979 album "Fear of Music", for which the band got a Grammy nomination. Right after the tour, Jerry went right back to work and started producing records. He worked with a group called the Escalators in New York and produced a record by a New Wave soul singer named Nona Hendryx, recording down in Philadelphia at the old Sigma Sound studio. The 1980 "Remain In Light" caused a big dispute in the band because of the credits. In the version released to the public, Jerry was given extra credit for “The Overload" and "Houses in Motion” alongside Brian Eno and David Byrne. In November of 1984, a record company called "Sleeping Bag Records" released a disk that began with the voice of Ronald Reagan saying, “My fellow Americans, I’m pleased to tell you today that I’ve signed leg­ islation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.” When Harrison heard this on the radio, he believed it summed up the entire presidency. Apparently, everyone had heard of the joke, but nobody actually heard it. He tracked down a copy of the tape through a college radio station. He then worked with coproducer Daniel Lazerus and funk bassist Bootsy Collins in the bomb shelter to create funk à la Reagan Apocalypse. “If the song is a hit,” Jerry quipped, “I’ll be willing to share royalties with ‘lyricist’ Ronald Reagan.”. The song was named Five Minutes (Bonzo Goes to Washington song).


=== Solo Career ===
Harrison has made three solo albums, his debut The Red and the Black in 1981, many have assumed that the album was named after Stendhal's novel of the same name, but in 2021, the singer admitted that the name was inspired by the group of Situationists. Some members had come to the USA to join the protests at Harvard against the Vietnam War, they had ended up living in Jerry's room and they would constantly talk about their philosophy and Wilhelm Reich, which fascinated Harrison. From this time, Jerry remembered a pamphlet that Guy Debord created named "The Red and The Black" and he just really liked the title. The main thoughts behind the album were the ideas of communism and anarchism.  In this album, the musician experimented with superimposing 7/4 against 3/4 against tired old 4/4. 
In 1988, he created Casual Gods, the album was recorded in Milwaukee in a bomb-shelter-turned studio by Harrison's elementary school's best friend's brother. During the day Jerry took care of his mother and during the night he worked at the studio. The track "Man with a Gun" was featured in the 1988 film "Two Moon Junction", and the instrumental version of the same song was used in the 1986 Jonathan Demme film "Something Wild". The single "Rev It Up" reached a high-point of number seven on the US Mainstream Charts in April 1988. and the music video starred babies.  
Harrison's last solo work was Walk on Water.
