Born in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, his first love was the piano but his mother wanted him to concentrate on schoolwork. He started his professional career as a musician at the age of 14, sneaking out of his second floor bedroom window at night to play gigs. When his mother discovered what he was doing, she shut down the piano and told him to concentrate on homework.
He ran away from home and went to Manila. In Manila he joined jazz groups, and from there he played in Taipei and Hong Kong where he met Mel Tormé, Lionel Hampton, Tito Puente, and Chico Hamilton. He got a job at the Golden Dragon Lounge in Honolulu. In Hawaii he became music director for Don Ho. From 1976 to 1977 he performed with Amapola Cabase in San Francisco, California. This was followed by appearances at the Wagon Wheel and Harrah's Hotel in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.
From 1980 to 1981, he was a sideman for Richie Cole on tour. During the next four years he made several albums for GNP Crescendo.Enriquez became a born-again Christian in 1993 and spoke of how God had changed his life. He played jazzy hymns at his church in Bayonne, New Jersey. He died of a pulmonary embolism on August 6, 1996 in Stayton, Oregon.
