By August 1953, the Hershiser family had relocated to Nashville, and by 1957 Charles had been promoted to District Sales Manager of the Mason & Dixon Lines, and the family had relocated to the Nashville suburb of Donelson.After attending high school in Donelson, Clark attended the Cookeville High School (as Ilo Hershiser) in Cookeville, Tennessee, graduating in 1967.

== Musical career ==
By the age of three, Clark (as Ilo Hershiser) had appeared as a dancer on television, and by August 1953 was scheduled to appear on television in Birmingham, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia. In a January 1961 interview, Clark indicated that she had had no formal voice lessons, but had been singing since the age of four, although she had studied dancing under Nashville choreographer Gene Nash, who also worked with singer Eddy Arnold. According to Barbara Hershiser, Nash recommended Ilo to Arnold, who in turn recommended her to his manager, Dick Linke, who signed her to a contract and changed her professional name to Robin Clark, with Clark being the family name of one of her maternal great great grandfathers, Ira Napoleon Clark.
By November 1960 Clark has been signed to Capitol Records and had recorded "The Butterfly Tree" written by Edmonton songwriter Harvey D. Judd in Nashville.
