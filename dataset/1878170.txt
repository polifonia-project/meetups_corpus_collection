Aslyn was born in west Florida and raised in Chiefland, Florida, outside of Gainesville.  At the age of seven, she began taking piano lesson Immediately submersing herself into the music scene, she did everything she could to gain exposure to live performing: entering talent contests, singing at weddings, and performing at church.Upon graduating from high school, Aslyn attended Carson-Newman College in Jefferson City, Tennessee and received her college degree. She then followed her dream of performing, which led her to Atlanta, Georgia, where she lived on various people's couches for a while as she performed throughout the town.
During this phase in her life, Aslyn purchased her first car with saved money. She referred to this car as a "lemon", and it eventually inspired the title track of her debut album, "Lemon Love". She briefly dated Butch Walker, mentioning him in her song "Golden" as "Number Five."

While performing on a nightly basis, Aslyn began to immerse herself in many different genres of music.  Many artists influenced her including Stevie Wonder, The Beatles, Earth Wind & Fire, and Queen.

Upon hearing the song, the record label signed her immediately.While preparing to record and write the songs for her debut CD, Aslyn requested to work with producer Guy Chambers.  She had become interested in Chambers' work after hearing the heavily European sound on many of Robbie Williams' albums. Chambers produced eight of the twelve tracks on Lemon Love.  For the remaining four, Aslyn worked with a California-based producer, Eric Valentine.
Two singles were released off the album: "Be the Girl" and "Gotta Get Over You". The first single that peaked at #35 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.
