Aaron Abeyta (born August 8, 1965), better known as El Hefe or simply Hefe, from el Jefe (Spanish for "the boss") is an American musician and actor, best known as the lead guitarist and trumpet player for the California punk band NOFX.
He started playing guitar at the age of 13, but he states that he started taking it seriously at the age of 15, joining his first band. 
Abeyta was given his nickname by NOFX founder Fat Mike because at the time he joined the band in 1991, Fat Mike was dating a girl named Erin and he didn't want there to be any confusion. Singer Fat Mike suggested the name El Hefe and his first recording with NOFX was his contribution to their EP The Longest Line. He once owned a nightclub called "Hefe's" in Eureka, California, and now lives in Stevenson Ranch, California. He has two children and is divorced from Jennifer Abeyta.
