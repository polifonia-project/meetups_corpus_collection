=== Music ===
Griffin started playing guitar at the age of 12 and states his childhood influences as KISS and Mötley Crüe. He didn't join his first band until 1999, which was Synical, with friend Ben Graves.
In 2002, Tripp Eisen showed a video of himself jamming with Griffin and Graves, to members of a project which he was involved with; the Murderdolls. Although not his preferred position of lead guitar, Griffin agreed to join the Murderdolls as the bassist. Murderdolls had already recorded their debut album by the time Griffin had joined, although he does feature in the album artwork for "Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls." He has since toured the world and made a name for himself in the music industry.
Griffin toured all over the world with the Murderdolls; Japan, United States, United Kingdom, etc. and found success with the band, featuring in promotional videos for "Dead in Hollywood," "White Wedding," and "Love at First Fright".
In 2004, as guitarist Joey Jordison returned to his primary band Slipknot, the Murderdolls went on hiatus. Since this time, Griffin has played with a number of other bands, such as New Rising Son, Genitorturers, Wednesday 13, The Dreaming, and Faster Pussycat, as well as a brief reunion of Synical for a tribute show.
Griffin has worked with Ajax Garcia and Jesse Mendez in the band The Napoleon Blownaparts, or The Blownaparts as they are also known. However, Griffin himself claims that his involvement with The Napoleon Blownaparts has been overblown by the media, as he has only played one show with them and recorded two cover songs.  He has also filled in as guitarist for Faster Pussycat after Brent Muscat was unable to tour.
In 2006, Griffin rejoined Murderdolls frontman Wednesday 13 in 13's solo band and toured with him for a year.
As of Friday, August 3, 2007, Wednesday 13's tour page, MySpace, and Eric's website stated that Griffin had reportedly left the Wednesday 13 tour band. No information was stated on the sites as to why he left. Griffin was replaced by J-Sin Trioxin.
In October 2007, Griffin entered The Chop Shop in Hollywood. and performed a guitar solo on Undercover Slut's "Kastration Kar Krashes" song, featured on "Amerikkka Macht Frei" (Undercover Slut's new album).
Griffin finished work on 'QUIT WHILE YOU'RE BEHIND' album/DVD to be released fall 2008. He and Ben Graves were joined by live bassist Dan Kincaid (Spit Out Star), and toured internationally, late 2008.
In 2009, Griffin joined Genitorturers as guitarist.
In a 2011 interview with Rock N Roll Experience Magazine, Griffin stated he was not invited to join the re-activated Murderdolls, stating "there's been debate over whether or not I was asked & whether or not I turned it down and I just want to be clear up one thing. Those 2 guys (Joey Jordison & Wednesday 13) did not invite or ask any of the members, they just did what they did and I'm not going to get into the why's or the how's or the who's, but yeah, it was their show, they didn't ask, they didn't tell...just like the military & that's the end of it."
