Johann Christoph Bach (22 February 1645 in Erfurt – 7 September [O.S. 28 August] 1693 in Arnstadt) was a German musician of the Baroque period.
A court and town musician in Arnstadt, he was the third son of Christoph Bach and the twin brother of Johann Ambrosius Bach. He was the uncle of Johann Sebastian Bach. He married Martha Elisabeth Eisentraut (1654–1719).
He is not to be confused with other Johann Christoph Bachs (see Bach family).
