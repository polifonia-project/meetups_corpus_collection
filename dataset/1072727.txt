John Voorhis "Tim" Bogert III (August 27, 1944 – January 13, 2021) was an American musician. He graduated from Ridgefield Memorial High School in his hometown of Ridgefield, New Jersey, in 1963. As a bass guitarist and vocalist he was best known for his powerful vocal ability and his fast runs, fluid agility and ground-breaking sound on his Fender Precision bass. He was one of the pioneers of using distortion with his bass to help it cut through the mix with the low-powered amps of his time which also imparted a very sharp-edged sound to it.  He was a frequent collaborator with drummer Carmine Appice; the duo performed in such bands as Vanilla Fudge, Cactus and the power trio Beck, Bogert & Appice.

Vanilla Fudge was formed by Tim Bogert along with Mark Stein, Vince Martell, and Carmine Appice.  They recorded five albums during the years 1967–69, before disbanding in 1970. The band has reunited in various configurations over the years.In 1970 Bogert formed the hard rock band Cactus with drummer Carmine Appice, guitarist Jim McCarty and lead vocalist Rusty Day. He then played with guitarist Jeff Beck, after the second Jeff Beck Group had disbanded in 1972 and eventually became a member of the power trio Beck, Bogert & Appice, late in 1972. As a member of the post-second Jeff Beck Group, also known as Jeff Beck Group, he toured Europe, Japan and the U.S. from January 1972 until January 1974. In late 1975, he played bass guitar on Bo Diddley's The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll all-star album.

Bogert then joined up with Bobby and the Midnites, a musical side project assembled by guitarist and vocalist Bob Weir of The Grateful Dead.

He then joined UK group Boxer and played on their final album "Absolutely" in 1977 – he had co-writing credits on three tracks on this album.
