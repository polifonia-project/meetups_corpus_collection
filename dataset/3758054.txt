He became executive chairman of OmniCorp, a New Zealand listed investment company based in London, in 1985; the company was sold in 1988.Morrison formed H.R.L. Morrison & Co in 1988 offering a broad range of investment advisory services across sectors. In the early 1990s Morrison & Co narrowed its focus to infrastructure as major privatisations took place in Australia and New Zealand.

In August 2011 the Morrison Index, the first investable index was launched by NZX. It is designed to
represent the strength and attractiveness of New Zealand's listed infrastructure sector. The NZX release of February 2011 stated "NZX plans to name the indices after individuals who have made outstanding efforts to develop and advance the related sector. The Investable Infrastructure Index will be named after Lloyd Morrison CNZM, in recognition of his instrumental contribution to the New Zealand infrastructure sector at many levels, including an enormous impact on quality and efficiency, and in taking New Zealand infrastructure exports globally to Australia, the US and the UK."In 2011 Lloyd was honoured by Wellington Businesses Gold Awards with a lifetime achievement award
and late November he was named Visionary Leader by Deloitte/Management magazine. "The Visionary Leader award honour roll contains the names of many of our legendary business figures, and Lloyd Morrison deserves his place alongside them.
