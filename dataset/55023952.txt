Émile Parisien (born 12 October 1982), is a French soprano and alto saxophonist, jazz musician, and composer.


== Career ==
Émile Parisien entered the fifth class at the age of 11 in the first class of Marciac's College de jazz, where he studied music with established musicians such as Pierre Boussaguet, Guy Lafitte and Christian "Tonton" Salut.
From 1996, he studied at the Conservatoire de Toulouse, where he also studied classical and contemporary music. During these years, he has had the opportunity to perform alongside major jazz figures such as Wynton Marsalis, Christian McBride, Johnny Griffin and Bobby Hutcherson, during the Jazz in Marciac festival.


== Influences ==

Parisien moved to Paris in 2000 and in 2004 founded his own quartet with Julien Touery (piano), Ivan Gélugne (double bass), and Sylvain Darrifourcq (drums). With compositions inspired by Hector Berlioz, Igor Stravinski, Arnold Schönberg, Richard Wagner, as well as John Coltrane and Wayne Shorter, this quartet gives an expressionist character to his music, where improvisation takes precedence.
Parisien performs in France and internationally with, among others, Michel Portal, Jacky Terrasson, Yaron Herman, Joachim Kühn, Stéphane Kerecki, John Taylor, Éric Serra, Paco Sery, Rémi Vignolo, Manu Codjia, Anne Paceo, Daniel Humair, Jean-Paul Céléa, Vincent Peirani.
