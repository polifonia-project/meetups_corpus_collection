Dukowski's first band was Würm which started in 1973. By 1977, the band had moved to Hermosa Beach and lived in a communal house called "the Würmhole". Keith Morris and Greg Ginn were regulars at Würmhole parties and eventually Dukowski joined with them to form the band Panic. Panic changed their name to Black Flag after discovering another band using the name "Panic".

Chuck Dukowski was responsible for booking Nationwide and worldwide tours, taking Black Flag across the globe to spread their anarchic musical message of Freedom of speech and expression to the world for all of their early tours until 1986.

He left the band before the release of My War, and afterward served as Black Flag's manager. Dukowski was also the co-owner of SST Records until 1989.

== Stage name ==
"Chuck Dukowski" is Dukowski's stage name; according to Dukowski, it originated from a Zippo lighter with "Chuck the Duke" inscribed on it that he found while searching for change. Feeling that the name "Chuck the Duke" sounded macho, he wanted to add a Polish sounding last name, as Poles were frequently picked on. He turned "Chuck the Duke" into "Chuck Dukowski". Dukowski was credited under his real name on original pressings of Black Flag's Nervous Breakdown EP as well as in film The Decline of Western Civilization and its companion soundtrack album. He is credited as "Charles Dukowski" on Black Flag's Damaged LP.
