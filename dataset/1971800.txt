Vito Lucente (Italian pronunciation: [ˈvito luˈt͡ʃɛnte]; born 31 August 1971), known by his stage name Junior Jack, is an Italian house music producer and DJ based in Belgium.


== Biography ==
In the early years Vito Lucente produced several acid house and Eurodance projects, mostly in collaboration with Eric Imhauser. However, his more famous project was as producer of the synthpop/rap group Benny B, with vocalist Amid Gharbaoui, DJ Daddy K and dancer Serge "Perfect" Nuet. Lucente left the band after the second album, and he did not produce their last single.


=== Career ===
Vito Lucente resided in Belgium in his teen years. In 1995, he abandoned Eurodance and adopted the name "Mr. Jack" (which would later morph into Junior Jack), dabbling in house music. He entered the UK Top 40 with the singles "My Feeling", "Thrill Me (Such A Thrill)", "E Samba", "Dare Me (Stupidisco)" and "Da Hype", the latter featuring vocals by Robert Smith from The Cure and uses samples from "I'm So Hot For You" by Bobby Orlando. His album Trust It was released to critical acclaim. "My Feeling" and "Stupidisco" were built around vocal samples from, respectively, "Saturday Love" by Alexander O'Neal and Cherrelle, and "Dare Me" by The Pointer Sisters. His latest single was a remake of "Dare Me (Stupidisco)", with vocals from Shena, which reached #20 in the UK Singles Chart on 25 February 2007
Lucente has also worked with disco artist Oliver Cheatham under the name Room 5, reaching number-one in the UK Singles Chart with the 2003 single "Make Luv" (which used samples from Cheatham's song "Get Down Saturday Night").
As a remixer, he has reworked tracks for artists such as Whitney Houston, Moby, Bob Sinclar and Utada. He has worked extensively in this area with partner Kid Creme.
