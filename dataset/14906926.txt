== History ==
Holden was discovered by Larry Nelson, who had just left work as a police officer to start his own record label. Holden spread the rumor that he had been heard singing by Nelson while being held in the King County jail after being arrested for marijuana and alcohol possession, but the story has not been confirmed. In 1959, Holden recorded the single "Love You So", which became a hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 11 on the US Billboard R&B chart and No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1960. Donna Records, owned by record company producer Bob Keane, bought the rights to Holden's recordings shortly after and issued a full LP entitled Love You So; this record was re-issued by Del-Fi Records in 1994. Holden returned to the charts in 1974 with "Can You Talk?" (U.S. R&B No. 49).He died of a heart attack in Rosarito Beach, Baja California, Mexico in 1997.
