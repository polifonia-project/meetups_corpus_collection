== DJ Mag controversy ==
Between 2006 and 2013 Gareth Emery ranked in DJ Mag's Top 50 DJs in the world, peaking at No. 7 in 2010. However, in 2013, he publicly denounced the poll due to the huge marketing budgets involved, asking fans no longer to vote for him, and donated his marketing budget to charity instead:"So here's an alternative Top 100 message: Don't vote for me. Seriously, when you buy a ticket to see me in a club, I consider that a vote. When you blast my music in your car, or share it on Facebook, or tell your friends about it, that's a vote too. Those votes, and the amazing support you've shown over the last year, is what matters to me."This move was covered by many dance music blogs.


== Labels ==
From 2003 to 2008, Gareth co-owned now defunct label Five AM under which some of his biggest hits from the time were released (Mistral / This Is That / More Than Anything). In late 2008 he left Five AM and started a new label called Garuda. The first Garuda release was his own record Exposure / Metropolis released in May 2009.Since then all Emery's records have been released through Garuda. It is named after the bird-like creature from Hindu and Buddhist mythology, which Emery became aware of whilst touring Indonesia. The label has released records by artists including Ben Gold, Tritonal, M.I.K.E. and Blake Jarrell. The label also runs occasional club nights.  Guests have included Ferry Corsten, Markus Schulz, Above & Beyond (band) and Sander Van Doorn.


== Podcast and SiriusXM show ==
Since March 2006, Emery has produced the 'Gareth Emery Podcast'. It has been nominated for "Best Podcast" at the Miami Winter Music Conference's International Dance Music Awards three times. In July 2012, Emery launched a syndicated radio show in North America called 'Gareth Emery Presents' on the SiriusXM channel Electric Area (Channel 52). The show is broadcast at 5pm ET Fridays with a repeat at 8pm ET Tuesdays.In November 2014, Emery announced that Episode 310 would be the final episode of the "Gareth Emery Podcast". He explained on social media:

"After doing the show more or less every week since 2006 I guess I'd become a bit too comfortable, and I sometimes felt like I was producing the show on auto pilot for the last year or so. Saying the same old **** and playing the same sounding music, and probably playing it a bit too safe, choosing the obvious bangers and hot promos rather than pushing myself to dig out those hidden gems like I always used to."
Emery then followed up with an announcement of a new podcast from his new SiriusXM show called "ELECTRIC FOR LIFE" In May 2015, Gareth Emery partnered with Electronic Music lifestyle brand Electric Family to produce a collaboration bracelet for which the proceeds are donated to his charitable foundation, Electric For Life.


== Satire ==
On 11 March 2016, Emery released single "CVNT5" together with Ashley Wallbridge. The "CVNT5" music video is a satirical view on careers of popular electronic dance music acts. The video featured two aspiring DJs played by Emery and Wallbridge who hoped to appear on the Forbes Highest-Paid DJs list. They climbed to international stardom by hiring a ghost-producer to create their songs and buying many Twitter followers, while dressing in ludicrous clothing and wigs. The song later appeared on Emery's third studio album 100 Reasons to Live. They released a second single on 19 March 2016 titled "They Don't Want Us To Win", which featured a sample from DJ Khaled saying "win" in the song's buildup. Wallbridge revealed that the project came to light during a drunken conversation in a pub, which purpose was to "have a laugh" and satirise the clichés in dance culture.The duo released a follow-up video through YouTube titled "DJ Mag Corruption Exposed: A CVNT5 Documentary" on 14 October 2016. The mockumentary showed CVNT5 continuing their attempt to reach number one on DJ Mag's annual Top 100 DJs list, notably by investing $50,000 into advertising, paying a black market Vietnamese click farm to generate votes, and bribing key figures in DJ Mag. CVNT5 ended up winning number two on the rankings albeit their efforts, likely due to another individual paying the magazine's Editor In Chief with a diamond-encrusted watch. Critics felt that the video served as criticism to DJ Mag's list; referring to the time in 2015 where DJs Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike won first place under suspicious circumstances, specifically by vote buying and having staff members walk around with iPads at their performing venues to secure extra votes.On 18 June 2018, American video streaming service go90 announced eight episodes of "We Are CVNT5", which will expand on the original CVNT5 mockumentary. The series was directed by Matt Enlow, written by Emery, Alex Madden and Geraint Jones, and featured Paul Holowaty, Taylor Misiak, Dillon Francis, and Pete Tong. The series was based heavily on Emery's musical experience during the United States' electronic dance music boom. A trailer for the series was released on 25 June 2018. Emery revealed through Facebook that the project encountered many issues during its production, including "tears", "screaming", and lawsuits, but managed to complete it in time. All eight episodes of "We Are CVNT5" were made available on 28 June 2018.
