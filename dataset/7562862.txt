Since the late 1960s, Keeling has been a keen advocate of the music of Robert Fripp and King Crimson. In 1999, Keeling was invited by Robert Fripp to arrange new versions of the King Crimson's music, as well as some of Fripp's solo guitar Soundscapes. Some of the resulting pieces have been performed, broadcast and recorded by The Metropole Orchestra of Amsterdam and there are plans for a CD release on Fripp's DGM label. Andrew Keeling is also co-author, together with Mark Graham, of A Musical Guide to King Crimson, a series of books, the first being "Musical Guide to In the Court of the Crimson King by King Crimson" (ISBN 978-0-9562977-0-9) published in August 2009. Musical Guides to Larks' Tongues in Aspic and In the Wake Poseidon follow with plans for further books in the series. He has also been a part-time lecturer at the University of Liverpool and the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester and performs in an improvisation duo with former King Crimson violinist David Cross. Their album English Sun was released in 2009.
