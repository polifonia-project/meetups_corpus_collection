== Musical career ==


=== Uncle Jamm's Army ===
Since the early 1980s Bobcat has been involved in hip hop, beginning in Los Angeles with West Coast icons and pioneers Uncle Jamm's Army, DJing and promoting large dances and concerts for Run–D.M.C., Whodini, Ice-T, and Kurtis Blow, establishing the beginning of the hip hop scene on the West Coast.At the time, Bobcat was only 15 years old and wasn't even tall enough to reach the turntables so they would have him stand on top of a milk crate to DJ. Back then Bobcat didn't own any professional equipment, so when he began working with Big Daddy Productions and Uncle Jamm's Army, Ice T's DJ Chris "The Glove" Taylor had to show him how to use the huge Cerwin Vega Mixer.
Roger Clayton, founder of Uncle Jamm's Army, would fly to the East Coast and pick up the hottest new underground records from various record stores in the city and bring them back to LA. Bobcat and The Egyptian Lover would take those records, play them first and break them at the big Uncle Jamm's Dances that drew over 15,000 people in the early 1980s.


=== California Catt Crew ===
As a member of the highly publicized Uncle Jamm's Army, Bobcat was in popular demand. He was booked months in advance and did two to six parties every weekend. After being overbooked week after week, he decided to form a crew of DJs similar to Uncle Jamm's Army, but with his signature sound and scratching techniques. He formed the California Catt Crew, which included Bobcat, Battlecat, Dr. Scratch Kat, Wild Cat, Cosmic Cat, Alley Cat, Courageous Cat and Kitty Kat. Bobcat helped book the DJs all around Southern California and gave them tips about the business.
At this time Bobcat recorded 12-inch single with Tracy Kendrick and Courtney Branch of Total Track Productions that included the Bobcat Song & California Catt Crew.


=== 1580 KDAY/Mix Masters ===
Bobcat, along with Uncle Jamm's Army, Greg Mack and Jack Patterson, helped pioneer the world's first 24-hour hip hop radio station, 1580 KDAY, changing the entire format of radio, introducing and pioneering the Saturday Night Mix Show and Traffic Jam. At the time, radio was traditional R&B and was playing very little rap. Bobcat thought of the idea, concept and name "Mix Masters" for Greg Mack at 1580 KDAY. The new format caused a national and international domino effect, changing various stations' view of hip hop and subsequently their format.
Uncle Jamm's Army and the Wrecking Crew are the forefathers of West Coast hip hop. The Mix Masters were the next generation.


=== Def Jam/Bigger & Deffer ===
After dominating the West Coast hip hop scene, Bobcat with his crew L.A. Posse flew to New York City and began working with rap mogul Russell Simmons, Lyor Cohen and Def Jam Records, writing and producing tracks for LL Cool J including "I Need Love", "I'm Bad", "Jack the Ripper", "Kanday", "Get Down", "Go Cut Creator Go" and "The Do Wop". The album Bigger and Deffer sold over 3 million copies, and is considered some of LL Cool J's best work.


=== "I Need Love" ===
Bobcat wrote the melody to "I Need Love" when he was 16 years old. It was originally a song titled "Friends By Day, Lovers By Night", Bobcat's version of "Secret Lovers" by Atlantic Starr.
"I Need Love" has been sampled and remade more than any other rap song in history. It has been sampled or replayed by Jermaine Dupri, Usher, Master P, Kris Kross and countless others.
Blender Magazine voted it the greatest rap song ever made.


=== Def Jam tour ===
LL Cool J asked Bobcat to go on the now world-famous Def Jam Tour. Bobcat signed on as DJ/music supervisor, and also designed and choreographed LL's stage shows. He toured all over the world, DJing and overseeing the sound and lighting.
The Def Jam Tour was one of the highest-grossing hip hop tours in history, grossing over $20 million in ticket sales worldwide. The tour toured all over the US and Europe, doing huge sold-out shows around the country including at the LA Sports Arena, the Omni in Atlanta and Madison Square Garden in New York. The Def Jam Tour featured Eric B & Rakim, Public Enemy, DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, Whodini, KRS-One, N.W.A, Salt N Pepa, Kool Moe Dee, Run–D.M.C., Stetsasonic, and LL Cool J, the headline act.


=== Cat Got Ya Tongue ===
