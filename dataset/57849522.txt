He was a photography major at Seoul Institute of Arts, but dropped out after his debut in 2018.Go decided to make his debut as a singer to speak out based on his experiences with violent assailants and victims inflicted on sexual minorities. While preparing the album, he tried to sign several agencies for his debut, but the deal was broken when he told the story of the sexual minority through music and expressed his wish to develop a discourse on discrimination against the sex minority on his own. In the end, he produced his first single with the money he saved from his part-time job for about two years without his agency.
