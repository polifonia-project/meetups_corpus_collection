Christian Jay "C. J." Bolland (born 18 June 1971, Stockton-on-Tees, England) is an English-Belgian electronic music producer and remixer with British roots.
Born in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, Bolland's family moved to Antwerp in Flanders, Belgium, when he was three years old. As a teenager, he was strongly influenced by the Belgian underground scene of new wave, electro and EBM embodied by artists such as Front 242, Neon Judgement and the Klinik.


== Producing and R&S Records ==
His first productions were aired on Belgium's 'Liaisons Dangereuses' radio show, and Bolland was one of the first record producers to be signed to the fledgling Belgian techno record label R&S. His first release, "Do That Dance" in 1989, was followed by several more under different aliases such as 'Space Opera', 'The Project', 'Cee-Jay' and 'Pulse'. Bolland's first major success with the track "Horsepower" on 1991s Ravesignal III EP earned him industry attention and respect with wide airplay amongst European techno DJs, and 1993s 4th Sign album, including the singles "Camargue" and "Nightbreed" saw him garner further acclaim and commercial success. Bolland's second album for R&S, Electronic Highway, was released in 1995.>


== Internal records ==
In late 1994, Bolland left R&S to sign a five album recording contract with Internal/Polygram Records. During this time he became notable as the first artist to release an album in the DJ-Kicks series for Studio !K7 independent record label, 1995's DJ-Kicks: C.J. Bolland. His first studio album for Polygram was 1996's The Analogue Theatre from which his greatest commercial success came with the single "Sugar Is Sweeter", hitting No. 1 on the United States Hot Dance Club Play chart, and reaching No. 11 on the UK Singles Chart.Further UK hits followed with "The Prophet" (#19) and "It Ain't Gonna Be Me" (#35). Bolland is also a prolific remixer with a long résumé, including work with Orbital, Depeche Mode, Moby, the Prodigy and Tori Amos. His song "The Prophet", sampling Willem Dafoe in Martin Scorsese's 1990 film The Last Temptation of Christ was an underground club hit.
The song "It Ain't Gonna Be Me" was featured in the soundtrack of film Human Traffic.
In 2000, Bolland released the song "Enter the Robot", a collaboration with the Australian producer Honeysmack, and in 2002 started his own record label, Mole Records. February 2004 saw the release of The Body Gave You Everything, the debut album by Magnus, a dance music/pop collaborative project with Tom Barman, founder and singer for the Belgian rock band, dEUS. In December 2006, Bolland released a solo album called The 5th Sign with the Belgian online record label, The Wack Attack Barrack, followed in October 2009 by 500€ Cocktail. This album is released on Wikkid Records, Beatport and on iTunes.
