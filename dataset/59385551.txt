As an eight grader, he participated in a three-night Simon & Garfunkel tribute show in New York City, as well as in the Hoboken Arts and Music Festival, where co-founder of Bar/None Records Glenn Morrow saw him performing and signed him. He released "Love Is a Drum" with Bar/None on 7-inch vinyl and digital download on April 20, 2010. It features Nada Surf drummer Ira Elliot and production by Daniel Rey. Skuller also made a cameo that year in a Supercute! music video.
