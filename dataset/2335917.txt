Shawn Drover (born May 5, 1966) is a Canadian musician, best known for his work with the American heavy metal band Megadeth.
He began playing the drums at the age of 13. In 1993 he founded the Canadian power metal band, Eidolon, with his brother Glen. He uses Sabian cymbals and Yamaha drums, Pro-mark drum sticks, Toca Percussion, Evans Drumheads and Extreme Isolation headphones.
After ten years in Megadeth, Drover announced his departure from the band on November 25, 2014, the same day that guitarist Chris Broderick also left the band. The pair formed the extreme metal supergroup Act of Defiance together in late 2014.


== Notes ==
While in rehearsal for "Blackmail The Universe Tour" in October 2004, six days before the first show, Shawn replaced newly returned drummer Nick Menza in thrash metal band Megadeth, who was unable to prepare for the physical demands of a full US tour.Shawn also has been playing guitar since 1980, which he learned from watching his brother, Glen Drover play. Shawn wrote most of the music for all 6 Eidolon records as well as all of the lyrics for all Eidolon records except "The Parallel Otherworld". He was playing guitar during Megadeth's "Blackmail The Universe Tour" in Kawasaki, Japan (April 3, 2005). Shawn and his brother Glen Drover switched instruments playing "Paranoid" and the second half of "Peace Sells". Glen sat at the drums, and Shawn played the guitar, during Gigantour show in Toronto on September 3, 2005. Shawn co-wrote the Grammy Nominated song "Head Crusher" from 2009's Endgame, as well as "Built for War" from 2013's Super Collider.
While on the Gigantour in 2005, Shawn became the third Megadeth guitarist on stage during "Peace Sells" while Mike Portnoy previously of Dream Theater played the drums. Shawn also did one solo of the song. The night after the statements were released that Shawn's brother Glen had quit Megadeth, Shawn and Glen recommended Chris Broderick as a possible replacement. Shawn then proceeded to show Dave a video of Chris playing both classical and electric guitar. Dave was immediately won over and soon managed to get in contact with Chris. Two weeks later, Broderick was officially declared the new guitarist for Megadeth.As opposed to many drummers, who cross over their sticks to play the hi-hat with their right hand and snare with their left hand, Shawn instead keeps time with his left hand, keeps a ride cymbal on the left side of his set, and relegates his right hand for snare drum hits (similar to Gene Hoglan and Simon Phillips). Although the role of each hand is reversed.  This is known as "Open handed drumming". Shawn Drover is himself left-handed.
As of 2015, Shawn Drover was Megadeth's longest-serving drummer, having been a member of the band for just over 10 years, and had the third-longest tenure in the band after only bass guitarist David Ellefson and guitarist and frontman Dave Mustaine. On November 25, 2014 Drover announced his departure from Megadeth, wanting to pursue his own musical interests. Following his departure from Megadeth, Drover teamed up with Chris Broderick, who left Megadeth the same day as him, to form Act of Defiance with vocalist Henry Derek and bassist Matt Bachand.
