Steve Swanson is the former lead guitarist for the death metal band Six Feet Under. He took over guitar duties from Allen West (of Obituary), who left the band in late 1997. Before Swanson joined in February 1998, he was in Massacre with Terry Butler on bass.
He has two children.
In early December 2008, Swanson's house was broken into, and a Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier, six guitars, a Line Six guitar amp, and a Hewlett Packard laptop were stolen.
