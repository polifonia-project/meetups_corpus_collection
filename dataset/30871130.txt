== Biography ==


=== Early years ===
John Schlitt was born in Lincoln, Illinois. Shortly after, his family moved to Mt. Pulaski where he grew up. Schlitt began singing and showing interest in music from a very young age. When he was 13 years old, he joined a band called Vinegar Hills Hometown Band Something Different. He went to Mt. Pulaski High School in his hometown graduating in 1968. It was during his high school years that he would meet future wife, Dorla Froelich.After graduating from high school, Schlitt enrolled in the University of Illinois for a degree in Civil Engineering. However, his main interest was still music. In 1972, he joined the rock band Head East as lead singer with some fellow students of the university. Juggling his musical career and college studies, Schlitt finally graduated from college in 1974 and dedicated full-time to his career in music.


=== Head-East era and aftermath ===

During the following years with Head East, Schlitt enjoyed the success of the band that produced several hits during the 70s. They released five studio and one live album. However, during the time, Schlitt also developed a dependency on cocaine and alcohol.  His dependency reached a peak when he was fired from the band in March 1980.
After leaving Head East, Schlitt formed a short-lived band, "Johnny", with brother Jeff Schlitt, Don Colluci, Jim McNeely, Troy Tipton and Burk Burkhardt, but the band quickly ended as his addiction intensified in a six-month depression during which he "came very close to suicide". During that same period, however, his wife became a born-again Christian and subsequently convinced Schlitt to see her pastor. Schlitt confesses that he had already decided to end his life and agreed to the meeting only "so my wife would be able to say ‘he tried’ after I was gone".Schlitt also became a born-again Christian. Following this, Schlitt decided to leave the music scene and rededicate his life to his family. After that, he started cleaning the floors at a factory, and slowly rose through the ranks until he became a mining engineer for a mining construction company and finally their cost and scheduling engineer. During this time, Schlitt attended Gethsemane Church in Evansville, Indiana, where he sang with the praise and worship team.31 years after being kicked out of Head East, Schlitt appeared with the band once again to mark the band's 2011 induction into the Iowa Rock N Roll Music Association Hall of Fame.
