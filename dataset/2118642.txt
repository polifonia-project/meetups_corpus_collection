Alfredo Hernández is an American drummer best known as a former member of desert rock bands Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age, Brant Bjork and the Bros and Yawning Man, and as a current member of his new band, Avon. He is jazz trained.


== Career ==
Hernández joined Kyuss in  1994, replacing previous drummer Brant Bjork who had left the band due to personal reasons. Kyuss' Josh Homme stated at the time that Hernández was the only drummer considered for the job. He appeared on the band's final studio album ...And the Circus Leaves Town. Kyuss soon went on indefinite hiatus in October 1995. Hernandez subsequently drummed on Queens of the Stone Age's self-titled debut record released in 1998. In 2004 he recorded an EP, and briefly toured, with former Queens of the Stone Age bassist Nick Oliveri's band, Mondo Generator.
Hernández was a founding member of the band Yawning Man, and later teamed up with fellow ex-Kyuss drummer Brant Bjork and Dave Dinsmore to form Ché. The 2000 album Sounds of Liberation was the only material which the band recorded and, after a small tour of live shows, the band disbanded, with Hernández joining Orquesta del Desierto. Later he joined Brant Bjork & The Bros on their album Somera Sól and toured with them in 2007.
Hernández played in Vic Du Monte's Persona Non Grata with Chris Cockrell and James Childs until 2011, recording three albums, two EPs and completing 10 tours since 2005.

He currently plays in the desert hardcore band "Family Butcher"
Hernández is also involved in a project with Mike Neider (Bl'ast/LAB) and Dave Dinsmore (Bl'ast/LAB/Unida/Che) called "Gusto".
Fellow Desert Rock drummer Brant Bjork described his relationship with Alfredo:

I’ve known Alfredo since I was 13. Alfredo called me, we were all living in the desert at the time. Alfredo had just gotten off of the road with Queens of the Stone Age and he gave me a call and said ‘look man, I just left the band’ and I said, ‘oh wow, OK’ and we chatted about that. - Brant Bjork
It’s hard to change drummers after four years but we knew Fredo was the man. He was the first person I thought of and the only person I called - Brant Bjork
