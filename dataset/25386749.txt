Derek Vincent Smith (born November 25, 1981), known by his stage name Pretty Lights, is an American electronic music producer. Pretty Lights was originally a music project consisting of Smith and Michal Menert, who left after the release of their first album. Rick Rubin once described Pretty Lights as "the face and voice of the new American electronic music scene".


== Early life ==
Smith started skateboarding with Michal Menert in the 8th grade. The pair, together with a drummer Menert knew, began making music after Smith brought a bass guitar to a skating session. Paul Brandt (Paul Basic) eventually replaced their original drummer. Calling themselves "The Freeze", the band consisted of Derek Vincent Smith on the bass guitar, Michal Menert on the guitar and keyboard, and Paul Brandt on the drums. The group was influenced by artists like the Beastie Boys, Tha Alkaholiks, A Tribe Called Quest, Wu-Tang Clan, The Roots, and The Casualties as well as by old school hip hop, funk, punk rock, and the skater culture. The band placed second in a community battle of bands in their sophomore year. After graduating from Rocky Mountain High School, Smith attended University of Colorado at Boulder, but dropped out during his freshman year to focus on his music instead.

=== 2012-2013: A Color Map of the Sun ===
In 2012, Pretty Lights was featured in the musical documentary "Re:GENERATION Music Project" producing the track "Wayfaring Stranger," featuring Country music stars LeAnn Rimes and Ralph Stanley for a collaborative effort mixing two genres, namely electronic and country.Pretty Lights released a new full-length album titled A Color Map of the Sun on July 2, 2013. It is the first Pretty Lights album that does not rely on borrowed samples; Smith instead composed and recorded tracks with session musicians in studios in Brooklyn, New Orleans and Denver and pressed the recordings to vinyl, samples of which were then combined with modular synths and digital production methods. For his fall 2013 tour, Smith toured with a full band including drummer Adam Deitch, keyboardist Brian Coogan, keyboardist Borahm Lee, trombonist Scott Flynn and trumpeter Eric Bloom.On December 6, 2013 A Color Map of the Sun received a nomination for Best Dance/Electronica Album in the 2014 Grammys. On December 10, 2013 Pretty Lights released A Color Map of the Sun Remixes.


=== 2014-2017: New Orleans Reinvention and Pretty Lights Live ===
Following the 2014 Grammy Awards, Smith relocated to Los Angeles to begin work on a new album at Rick Rubin's Shangri-La studio. After several months of writing and recording, Smith relocated to New Orleans in mid-2014. Over the following two years, Smith recorded music with local musicians and played sporadic shows with the Analog Future Band.In 2015 Pretty Lights headlined the Suwannee Hulaween music festival the last weekend of October.Following Analog Future's final show at New Orleans’ Buku Music + Art Project in March 2016, Smith soon formed the new band Pretty Lights Live. The new band features Smith, drummer Alvin Ford Jr., keyboardist Brian Coogan, keyboardist Borahm Lee, and turntablist Chris Karns. On May 31, 2016, Smith announced that the band would embark on a five-stop "Episodic Festival" U.S. tour with two-day stops in Gilford, NH, Morrison, CO, Telluride, CO, Chicago, IL, and Nashville, TN. Shortly after, Coogan left the band and was replaced by Brandon Butler.In late 2016, Smith revealed that he was working on his first new album in four years, with a tentative release date set for April 2017. Pretty Lights Live is slated to play at several major U.S. music festivals in 2017, including Summer Camp Music Festival in May and Camp Bisco in July. The band then performed in Detroit, MI, Minneapolis, MN, and Philadelphia, PA, over the New Year's holiday period."[T]he only shows of the summer, [and] possibly all" of 2018 took place at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on August 10 and 11, celebrating the tenth consecutive year of Pretty Lights performing there.


== BassLights ==
Smith has also put on the two night annual event known as BassLights from 2012 through 2015. Smith and crew pairs with Bassnectar to bring the yearly event to the Hampton Coliseum on the weekend between Christmas and New Years. The pair brought along with them major supporting acts such as Big Gigantic, Gramatik, GRiZ and A-Trak in 2012. 2013 featured yet again Big Gigantic along with Pretty Lights Music godfather Michal Menert, Datsik (musician) and Keys N Krates. 2013 also brought along the Analog Future Band who performed both nights alongside Pretty Lights adding a fresh new take on his music performing it with live instrumentation. 2014 kept the tradition of major opening acts going strong with the return of Beats Antique who had been a PrettyNectar Alumni from when they played in 2011 in Alpharetta, GA, Exmag, Chromeo (dj set) and Elliot Lipp. This event sold out in record time in 2014 selling out all tickets in the first weekend they went on sale.
2013 also saw an extra official Basslights that was held October 18–19 at the Klipsch Amphitheater at Bayfront Park in Miami Florida, with support by PANTyRAiD, Run the Jewels, Koan Sound and Supervision.
The most recent Basslights, in 2015, is assumed to have been the last.


== Style ==

Smith's music relies heavily on digital sampling and crosses many genres, forming a combination of "glitchy hip-hop beats, buzzing synth lines, and vintage funk and soul samples". Pretty Lights' sound is generated by manipulating samples and organic beats using the Novation X-Station, monome and the  Akai MPD32. Smith uses these digital controllers to program the music production software Ableton Live 8. When performing live, Smith uses two Macbook Pros running Ableton Live 8 and two Akai MPD32s. Smith usually considers his music as "Electro Hip-Hop Soul," a mix between elements of electronic based music, and beats from hip-hop and soul music.
