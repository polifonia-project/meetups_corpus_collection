=== 2011–2014: Bollywood mash-ups, "Ab Laut Aa" ===
Sanjoy began his professional music career in 2011 with a series of mash-ups and remixes that were well received in the Indian-American community. The cultural connection between Indian-Americans and Bollywood music had resulted in niche audiences who were very interested in remixed Hindi film music for dance performances and videos. His first mash-up "Chammak Challo" featured dancers from the UC Berkeley dance team, Azaad, and built his core audience of Bollywood-EDM listeners who were connected to the dance team circuit. He later released another video and mash-up called Love the Pressure, which further engaged those of Indian descent worldwide.His first original music video was called "Tonight I Believe" (2012). The track received much attention across the Internet, but because of the negative response and criticism with the vocals, it was promptly pulled from YouTube. Deb also released an unofficial remix of Swedish House Mafia's "Don't You Worry Child".
In 2013, Sanjoy produced a single for the well-known Indian singer Sunidhi Chauhan. Their collaboration Ab Laut Aa was well-received, especially due to the topic of the music video on the prevalence of gender discrimination and rape in India. He subsequently released a reprise version featuring Gaurav Dagaonkar as the vocalist & songwriter.


=== 2014–2016: T-Series deal, Dance Under the Influence ===
The 'Ab Laut Aa' collaboration ultimately propelled Sanjoy through a series of production opportunities with various Hindi film music directors, such as Pritam and Salim–Sulaiman. Some of these projects included Shaadi Ki Side Effects, and Bajrangi BhaijaanThe well-established label T-Series also signed a multi-single deal with Sanjoy to remix well-known Bollywood songs, in his distinct mash-up style. There are two released mash-ups with T-Series, Tum Hi Ho and Gumshuda. Both songs retain the original singers but have been remixed into an electro-pop dance record. Tum Hi Ho draws influences from Swedish House Mafia's Greyhound.In 2016, Sanjoy began to release a series of English songs, each featuring a well-known Bollywood singer. His track "Don't Funk With Me" with Benny Dayal broke the ice on his English music. His next track released in February, named "Completed Me", featuring Aditi Singh Sharma. This compilation resulted in his album, Dance Under the Influence.
The front single for Dance Under the Influence, Slip Away, introduced the American Idol nominee Trevor Holmes as his first collaboration and single. The music video features Sanjoy at one of his live shows in Santa Cruz.
