Mike Kaufmann (born 1966) is an American heavy metal bass guitarist best known as the bassist for the thrash metal band Defiance. 


== Biography ==
Starting Defiance band in 1985 with friends Matt Vander Ende and Brad Bowers, he quickly became a key reason for the band's success, co-writing much of their material and playing on all four of their LPs, Product of Society, Void Terra Firma, Beyond Recognition, and The Prophecy.
He also handled most of the band's business affairs and was responsible for getting the band's first shows, supporting such acts as Testament (then Legacy) and Lȧȧz Rockit, which resulted in label interest. He co-produced and funded the recording of the Hypothermia demo which caught the attention of Monte Conner and Roadrunner Records and landed them a record deal. He is the only member of Defiance who has been with the band from its beginning.
After Defiance disbanded in 1993, he played bass for Inner Threshold and later formed the band Under with long-time friend and Defiance bandmate Doug Harrington. Under thrived in the Bay Area music scene over the next five years playing shows to support bands such as Machine Head, Exodus, Sevendust, and various others. Under was on the verge of signing a record deal when they broke up because of personal and musical differences.
In 2005 Defiance reunited, and along with Steev Esquivel, Jim Adams, and Doug Harrington began work on the fourth studio album. Following Harrington's passing in 2006, the band moved on to finish the album without him as he had requested.
