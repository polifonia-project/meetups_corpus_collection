Vince Herman is a guitarist and singer and songwriter best known for being one of the founding members of Leftover Salmon. Leftover Salmon started in 1989 as somewhat of a melding of the Left Hand String Band and the Salmonheads, and became more and more popular over the sixteen years that followed. The band decided to go their separate ways in 2005, but still play together (billed as Leftover Salmon) on occasion. Since the hiatus, Herman formed a new band named Great American Taxi, who released their debut album in 2007. GAT toured extensively and garnered a following, with hijinx such as joining Peter Rowan on stage, playing a Ficus tree for Moonalice. Often when finishing the first jam of the night he tells the crowd "I feel a hell of a lot more like I do now than I did a few minutes ago". Vince toured with GAT until the Leftover Salmon tours called Vince away in 2013. Rumor has it you can find him playing in Colorado these days. Great American Taxi is an ever evolving band with the likes of Todd Snider and Tim Carbone taking the stage since Vince's departure.
Vince resides in Boulder, Colorado and continues to tour with Leftover Salmon, as of 2020.
