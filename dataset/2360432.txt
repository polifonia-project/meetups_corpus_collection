== Technique ==

Dave Knudson is well known for his use of two-handed tapping. He uses this technique to create polyphony (countermelodies), whereby his right hand will tap a treble melody, whilst his left hand plays a bass accompaniment. This technique is most apparent on the album Highly Refined Pirates, where it is used on every single song (except the electronic interludes.)
Dave is also known for his use of the Line 6 DL-4 delay modeller's sampler capability. The DL-4 can be used to record a phrase which can then be played back instantly by stepping on one of the DL-4's buttons. The sample can also be reversed, slowed down or sped up, effects which Dave makes use of both in the studio (notably on Menos El Oso), but can also be replicated live. Dave can often be heard recording and preparing the samples before the start of songs when playing live.


== Graphic design ==
On top of playing and touring with Minus the Bear, Dave has also designed the artwork for the band's releases and the majority of apparel, as well as artwork for other bands such as Pretty Girls Make Graves.
