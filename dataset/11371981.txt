Kevin Michael (born Kevin Michael Seward, October 22, 1985, in Chester, Pennsylvania) is an American pop artist that was signed to Downtown Records in 2007, the same year he released his self-titled debut album.


== Early life ==
Born in Chester, Pennsylvania, Michael grew up in a mixed-race family.  His father is African-American and his mother is bi-racial.  This had quite an effect on him as a child growing up and would serve as one of his main messages in later musical work.  He is a self-taught vocalist with a five octave range. Kevin cites artists like Prince, Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder as some of his biggest musical influences.  At the age of 16 he wrote his first song, and has continued writing his own material throughout the years.  Kevin says he loves writing music just as much as singing it.
