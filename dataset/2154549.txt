DJ Dan (born Daniel Wherrett) is a house music DJ and producer from the United States.


== Career ==
Wherrett grew up in Lacey, Washington. He moved to Seattle from 1988–1990 to study fashion, where he discovered electronic dance music at clubs such as The Underground, where he heard Randy Schlager and Donald Glaude, and started experimenting with this music himself.
In 1991, he moved to Los Angeles. After playing a few events with LA-based DJ Ron D Core, with whom he released a series of mixtapes and live mixes, he made his way to San Francisco in 1993 where he joined Funky Tekno Tribe. In 1996 he partnered with Jim Hopkins, releasing Loose Caboose under the name Electroliners. This track was picked up by DJs such as Carl Cox, Sasha, John Digweed, and Lee Burridge. Pete Tong played Wherrett's first Essential Mix in 1988, with a follow-up in 1999, and again in 2007 with Frankie Knuckles at the Winter Music Conference.
In 2000, Carl Cox invited Wherrett on his tour. In the same year, Wherrett's track "That Zipper Track" was released on four labels worldwide, and went on to sell over 100,000 copies on vinyl. In 2001, he created his own label, InStereo Recordings.DJ Mag named DJ Dan the #1 House DJ in 2006. URB magazine named him "America's Favorite DJ" and "America's Hardest Working DJ". In 2014 he was rated the #9 DJ in the US according to the DJ Times' "America's Best DJ" Poll
