== Early life ==
Ajay and Atul Gogavale were born to Ashok Gogavale, a Revenue Department officer in Alandi in Pune. Both were brought up in several villages in western Maharashtra, including Rajgurunagar,Junnar, Shirur, Manchar and Ghodegaon as their father had a transferable job. Atul, the elder of the brothers, was born on 11 September 1974 and Ajay, the younger of the brothers, was born on 21 August 1976.
Over their childhood, they were not much attracted towards academics. But their interest in music developed while they were still in school. Around this time, they started experimenting with music. In an NCC competition, Ajay played an existing composition differently, and they won the prize for their experiment. This instance inspired them to explore their music potential.They did not have a musical background. Although they were not supported by their family directly for music, they were never denied any assistance. As their family could not afford the instruments for their musical endeavors, they started their musical ventures through their school, temples, local bands, etc. Despite not getting direct training, they learned a lot from these ventures. They would befriend people who owned instruments like harmoniums, mridangam, dhol etc., since they could not afford them on their own.
Later, while at college, they started working with local bands as arrangers. Their father bought them a keyboard on their mother's insistence. This proved to be one of their greatest gifts. Their father said, "You have not been given any toys during childhood, now this is your toy." This inspired them and they started experimenting.


== Career as music composers ==
Later, they came to Mumbai and started working on an international non-film music album "Vishwavinayaka". This proved to be a big break for them and paved the way for their foray into the Indian (mostly Marathi) music industry. They worked on many commercial jingles, ballets, and advertisements to strengthen their profile.
Man Udhān Vāryāche (मन उधाण वाऱ्याचे), Malhāravārī (मल्हारवारी), Kombdī Paḷalī (कोंबडी पळाली ) are some of their notable compositions. Ajay–Atul composed the songs and background score for the Marathi film Naṭarang (नटरंग) (2010).

They composed music for the Hindi films Singham & Bol Bachchan starring Ajay Devgan and directed by Rohit Shetty and Agneepath  & Brothers produced by Karan Johar and directed by Karan Malhotra. They have also contributed music to the Aamir Khan starrer PK. In 2016, they worked in Nagraj Manjule's film Sairat which is the only Marathi film to gross over 1  billion. They also worked in Manasu Malligey, the film's Kannada remake and Dhadak, the Hindi remake. They produced the Marathi film Jaundya Na Balasaheb directed by Girish Kulkarni.
