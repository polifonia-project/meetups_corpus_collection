Amelia "Milly" Toomey (born 6 December 1997), known professionally as Girli (stylised in all caps), is an English singer, songwriter and rapper. Based in London, she has released a number of singles and 3 EPs. The Guardian has described her sound as veering "between PC Music, bubblegum pop, pop punk and rap, each one treading a line between catchy and deliberately discomforting." Much of her music is about feminism, sexuality, queer culture, and mental health. In April 2019, Girli released her debut studio album, Odd One Out, on PMR Records. After being dropped by her record label and later being forced to cancel her 2020 Sofa Tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Girli announced her comeback in 2021 with the release of new EP, Ex Talk. She is currently with independent label AllPoints.

While performing in indie band Ask Martin as Milly Toomey in her mid-teens, Girli had short brown hair and wore men's clothing. As Girli, she has a distinctive visual aesthetic that includes neon pink dyed hair. Girli has observed a close link between her music and her fashion style. Describing her transition into a pink aesthetic, she said "I was really into indie, then I started listening to more female-made music, and my style developed based on what I was listening to." In a 2018 interview she described "wearing way more non-pink items of clothing, black, tartan and fishnet tights" when performing songs with a "more alternative and rockier sound".Girli has named Harajuku street fashion, the 1990s riot grrrl scene, and noughties girl bands as fashion influences.Another core part of Girli's public persona is her feminist beliefs. Early interviews describe Girli throwing tampons into the crowd at gigs, which she said was a way of challenging the societal taboo around menstruation. Girli has expressed the view that music is a way to effect political change, in a way she views as more effective than parliamentary politics, which she became disillusioned with after her time as a Youth MP. She announced a partnership with Girls Against, an organisation campaigning against sexual harassment in live music venues, in 2016.She took part in stylist Louby McLoughlin's project OKgrl, a fashion and music platform, in 2017, and Kirsti-Nicole Hadley's GRL PWR, a female-only arts collective.

Commenting on gender identity in a 2017 interview, she said : "Right now I identify as a woman, but what does that even mean? Is that what I say, who I am? Right now I feel like a woman, but that may change. Some days, I'm like 'fuck it, I don't feel like a woman or a man.'"She has stated that she suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder and takes antidepressants. Her single "Up & Down" is about her mental health struggles. She is a skateboarder.
