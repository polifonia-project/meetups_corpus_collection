Timex Social Club is an American R&B group, formed in 1985 and best known for the 1986 hit single "Rumors".


== History ==
Originally known as the Timex Crew, members included Marcus Thompson (founder), Gregory "Greg B" Thomas, Michael Marshall, Craig Samuel, and Darrien Cleage. By 1986, Samuel, Cleage, and Thomas had departed, Alex Hill and Kevin Moore were added, and the name Timex Social Club was adopted (despite the group's name, Timex Group USA bears no sponsorship of the group). Later in 1986, Ocea Savage was added on keyboards and background vocals. They fused funk and urban R&B with Washington go-go beat.
In 1986, the group released the Vicious Rumors album on Danya/Fantasy Records (A&M in Canada; Mercury in Germany). Its one major hit, "Rumors", written by Marshall, Thompson, and Hill, peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100, #13 in the UK, and No. 1 on the Billboard R&B, Hot Dance Club Play, and Hot Dance/Disco-12 inch Singles-Sales charts. The two follow-up singles, "Thinkin' About Ya" and "Mixed-Up World", reached the R&B Top 20.


=== Tour ===
The success of the single "Rumors", prompted hip hop impresario Russell Simmons to hire the group as the opening act for 38 dates on Run DMC's Raising Hell tour in 1986. Other acts on the tour were Beastie Boys, LL Cool J, and Whodini. Besides solo dates, the group also opened for New Edition, Midnight Star, the S.O.S. Band, Kool & the Gang, and Jermaine Jackson.


=== Split ===
Timex Social Club disbanded shortly after the success of "Rumors". The band's producer Jay King, Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy formed Club Nouveau, whose first single was "Jealousy", an answer song to "Rumors" that references Timex Social Club's split. Club Nouveau subsequently had a #1 Billboard Hot 100 hit in 1987 with a go-go cover of Bill Withers' "Lean on Me".


=== Revival ===
As of 2011, the current Timex Social Club roster consisted of founding member Marcus Thompson as DJ and Samuelle Prater on vocals.
