Wax is of Irish and Cuban descent and hails from Dunkirk, in Calvert County, Maryland. He grew up watching music videos and live performances on MTV.

=== MacGregor ===
From 2000-2005, Wax was the lead vocalist and guitarist of the six piece band MacGregor. The band toured throughout the United States in the Midwest, the South, and New England, receiving a lot of local buzz in D.C. and Maryland. The group released two albums before entering a "super-extended" hiatus. They split because members had obtained other jobs or engaged in serious relationships. During this time, Wax also released his first solo EP, Biatch!


=== YouTube ===
In mid-2007, Wax and his twin brother, Herbal T, started posting videos of themselves rapping on YouTube. In early 2008, Wax made a name for himself after performing his song ("New Crack") over a Stephen Marley track called "Traffic Jam" while driving. The YouTube video has received over 2.2 million views. He also began to collaborate with other well known musicians on YouTube, such as Dumbfoundead and Prince Ea. After he cracked YouTube's Top 100 Musician list, his subscription base tripled and averaged about nearly 1,000 new subscribers each day. His videos have collectively garnered over 80 million views on his YouTube channel. The famous YouTuber Ray William Johnson then asked him to make an outro song titled "Stalkin Ya Mom". The two later collaborated on a song called "Orphan Tears".  On December 15, 2014 he appeared in the Epic Rap Battles of History episode Steven Spielberg Vs. Alfred Hitchcock playing Quentin Tarantino. He later returned to ERB in 2019 in the episode Freddy Krueger vs Wolverine in which he portrayed Freddy Krueger.

His lead single is a song called Dispensary Girl and the music video debuted on Entertainment Weekly a day before Scrublife released.
