== The Tonight Show with Jay Leno ==
In 2004, Murdock ran into Kevin Eubanks in Las Vegas and began working with his band before joining The Tonight Show Band on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno from 2006 to 2011. Eubanks maintained his own band apart from the show to expand his personal music horizons. Murdock toured with this band on the weekends from 2007 to 2010 and performed with the Tonight Show Band through the 18th season of the show, when Eubanks left.


== The Jay Leno Show ==
Kevin Eubanks and the Tonight Show Band became The Primetime Band as The Tonight Show transitioned into The Jay Leno Show. The short-lived series aired at 10 PM for four months from 2009 to 2010 but was cancelled due to poor ratings and time slot conflicts with other shows. Although several members of the band left, Murdock was one of the few who stayed with Eubanks through the Primetime Band and the Tonight Show.

Murdock uses the TC Electronic RH450 head, RS210, RS410, RS212 cabinet and Roland Cube-120XL for amplification. He plays on basses by Fender, Ken Smith, and Demars Guitars.
