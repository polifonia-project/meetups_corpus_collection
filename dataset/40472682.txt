Jasper Høiby (born 10 May 1977 in Copenhagen, Denmark) is a Danish Jazz musician (double bass) known for his virtuosity and high-energy eloquence.


== Career ==
Høiby started to play the double bass in Denmark before he moved to the U.K. in 2001 to study at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where got into the London jazz scene. Whilst at the RAM he studied with Milton Mermikides. His time at the Royal Academy of Music led to membership of the Loop Collective, where he later collaborated with Ivo Neame. Now Høiby established himself as a bassist at the London Jazz scene, with performers such as with vibes player Jim Hart, saxophonist Mark Lockheart and vocalist Julia Biel.Høiby formed Phronesis in 2005, and the debut album Organic Warfare (2007), featured Magnus Hjorth (piano). The second album Green Delay (2009), was dedicated to Høiby's sister Jeanette, who lost her sight, and features the current lineup with Neame and Eger. Both albums were received well by critics and fans and helped to establish Phronesis' reputation as one of Europe's best up- and-coming bands. It was Alive (Edition Records, 2010) that really broke big, gaining rave reviews and Best Album awards from Jazzwise and Mojo. The album was recorded at the Forge in Camden, London. Due to a last-minute problem, Eger was unavailable. American drummer Mark Guiliana took his place temporarily, for the concerts that formed the basis of the album, before Eger returned to the fold. Phronesis has recorded 8 albums, all receiving critical acclaim.
His reading of, and response to, Naomi Klein's influential book on climate change This_Changes_Everything_(book) prompted Høiby to found his band Fellow Creatures.
