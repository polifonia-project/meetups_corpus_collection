Evan Dorkin (born April 20, 1965) is an American comics artist and cartoonist. His best known works are the comic books Milk and Cheese and Dork.  His comics often poke fun at fandom, even while making it clear that Dorkin is a fan himself.


== Life and career ==
Dorkin was born in Brooklyn, New York, and moved with his family to Staten Island when he was 13 years old. He grew up reading superhero comics (being loyal to Marvel over DC), Mad magazine, and humor titles by Archie Comics and Harvey Comics. He became even more obsessed with comics when comic book retailer Jim Hanley opened a store location near his high school; Dorkin later ended up working there.Dorkin aspired to attend the School of Visual Arts in the animation department, but was not accepted. (He had taken some animation classes at SVA while he was in high school.) Dorkin ended up attending New York University Tisch School of the Arts, but eventually switched his passion from animation to comics.Dorkin's earliest published solo comics were Pirate Corp$ (later renamed Hectic Planet), published first by Eternity Comics and then Slave Labor Graphics from 1987 to 1989; and then a variety of Milk & Cheese titles, published by Slave Labor Graphics from 1991 to 1997.
As well as his comics work, Dorkin and his wife, Sarah Dyer, have written for Space Ghost Coast to Coast. Dorkin drew the cover art for several ska compilation albums in the 1990s. He wrote and produced an animated television pilot for Adult Swim titled Welcome to Eltingville, based on his own characters. He and Dyer wrote some episodes of the Superman: The Animated Series including the episode "Live Wire", which introduced a new character of the same name. Dorkin wrote the Superman and Batman: World's Funnest one-shot in 2000 which was drawn by various artists. Dorkin and Dyer worked as freelance writers on the 2006 English-language version of the anime Crayon Shin-chan, where they wrote material for the show's first six episodes. Dorkin co-created Beasts of Burden with Jill Thompson. Dyer has frequently colored Dorkin's art.
