Adrienne "Adie" Camp (n√©e Liesching; born 12 July 1981) is a South African singer and songwriter, who is known as the lead singer of the Christian pop-rock band the Benjamin Gate before the group disbanded in 2003. She briefly contributed to other artist's albums, namely her duet with rapper John Reuben featured on his album Professional Rapper and her background vocals on husband Jeremy Camp's albums Restored and  Live Unplugged, after the Benjamin Gate disbanded.
She now works under the name "Adie" and released her debut solo album Don't Wait on 26 September 2006. The album was co-produced by her husband Jeremy Camp. Her song "Your Way" climbed into the Top 15 on R&R Magazine's Christian chart in May 2007. Her second release, titled Just You and Me, was released in March 2010.


== Personal life ==
In December 2003, Liesching married American CCM musician, Jeremy Camp. The couple met on a three-month-long tour in 2002. They have two daughters and one son: Isabella "Bella" Rose Camp (born 25 September 2004), Arianne "Arie" Mae Camp (born 5 April 2006), and Egan Thomas Camp (born 17 August 2011).


== Voice ==
Todd Hertz of Christianity Today described Camp's voice as "lovely and ferocious," a "strange combination of Bjork's quavering and the power of Shirley Manson." A reviewer writing for the Daily Herald of Arlington Heights, Illinois described Camp's voice as evocative of Gwen Stefani, Aimee Echo, Christina Aguilera, and Shakira, all the while "remaining very unique and distinctive."
