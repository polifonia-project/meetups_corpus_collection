Leroy Jordan (born November 21, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter. He is a founding member of the American funk band War. Jordan had a number of roles over the years, acting as vocalist and playing guitar, piano, synthesizer, and percussion. He was among the first three people to join the group after its inception, having joined before the group adopted the name "War" (it had previously been known as "the Creators" and "Nightshift"), as well as being the group's only remaining original member.
Jordan recorded as a solo artist with MCA in 1977 and Boardwalk in 1982. He has also recorded with Eric Burdon, Tanya Tucker, T. Rex and Los Lobos.
Jordan also made a record with two members of War, Harold Brown and B.B. Dickerson, The Other Side of War Warms Your Heart on Souffl√© Records, which featured Bobby Womack on guitar. Lonnie Jordan is the only current member of War from the original lineup. Four other members created a new group called Lowrider Band. In 2017, Lonnie Jordan co-wrote and featured on vocals on Alex Puddu album From the Beginning on three songs "Runaway Boys", "Nobody" and "Stormy Weather".
