Liam Genockey (born 12 August 1948) is an Irish musician, who is the drummer with British folk rock band Steeleye Span.


== Biography ==
Genockey was born in Dublin, Ireland. During the  1960s he lived in Plymouth, Devon, U.K, playing in local semi-pro groups and then, in the early 1970s, playing with Torbay-based rock band Adolphus Rebirth. He was one of the founding members of the early-1970s jazz-fusion and afro-prog band Zzebra, later moving on with fellow band-member John McCoy to join Gillan.
He then participated in Amalgam, formed in 1976 by Trevor Watts. Watts' work covers the spectrum of free jazz, electronic, jazz-rock, space jazz and folk-rock. Watts later founded 10-piece Moiré Music Ensemble which included Genockey again, along with Peter Knight, an early member of Steeleye Span.
Genockey joined Steeleye Span in 1989 and recorded two studio albums Tempted and Tried and Time, with them, as well as two live albums Tonight's the Night...Live and The Collection in Concert. Between 1997 and 2001, however, he was not in the band. He returned in 2001 to record Present – The Very Best of Steeleye Span, and has remained with the band since, though he also remains Paul Brady's drummer for both live and studio performances.
In January 2003, he was involved in the BBC Four broadcast of Free Will and Testament, a programme featuring performance footage of Robert Wyatt.Liam is easily identified by his long, plaited beard. He currently lives in Hastings in East Sussex.
