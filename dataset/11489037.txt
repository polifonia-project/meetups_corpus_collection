Bob Bennett (born March 21, 1955) is an American contemporary Christian music singer, guitarist and songwriter from Downey, California. Bennett is known for his distinctive baritone voice, Christian lyrics and folk-inspired guitar playing.


== Career ==
Bennett was born in Downey, California.  He picked up his first guitar at age nine and formed a rock 'n' roll band in high school.  In the late seventies he converted to Christianity and his songwriting began to reflect his newfound faith.His career was launched with the release of his 1979 folk-style debut recording First Things First. Three years later, Matters of the Heart, a recording CCM Magazine selected as 1982's "Album of the Year", and later ranked it 25th on its list of contemporary Christian albums of all time. Soon after the release of his next recording, Non-Fiction, he served as opening act on Amy Grant's Unguarded tour. Lord of the Past: A Compilation followed, which peaked at 30th position on Billboard magazine's Top Contemporary Christian chart in 1990. The album's title song reached number one on the Christian radio charts in early 1990. This was followed by Bennett's second number one song: "Yours Alone".
Later in 1990 Bob joined Michael Card on his The Way of Wisdom tour, performing in front of sold-out audiences across the country.  Bob credits his tour with Michael Card as being the only reason he had a career in 1990 and 1991.  Songs from Bright Avenue was released in 1991, a collection of songs he wrote while struggling with the dissolution of his marriage.  Bob's most recent solo CD is Christmastide, released in 2009.  The project, Jesus Music Again, a collaboration with Bill Batstone and Alex MacDougall, was released in 2011.Bob plays a Kevin Ryan guitar.Bob is currently signed with Signpost Communications.
