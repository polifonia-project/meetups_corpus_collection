== Biography ==
David Bryant joined Godspeed You! Black Emperor in 1997 as a third guitarist, later also doing recording, mixing, and photography for the band.
In 2001 David Bryant set up the experimental music project Set Fire to Flames combining post-rock with background noise and various other non-musical sound effects, creating a brooding, eerie, and minimalist sound.
During the 2003–2010 Godspeed hiatus Bryant met Kevin Doria, of the bands Growing and Total Life, and in 2008 they formed the band Hiss Tracts – named after a Set Fire to Flames song. Bryant was also the recording engineer for the three Growing albums released between 2006 and 2008.In 2015, together with bandmate Karl Lemieux, Bryant directed the experimental documentary short film Quiet Zone. Together with Kevin Doria and Thierry Amar he has also written the score for Lemieux's 2016 feature film Shambles.
In 2017, Bryant collaborated with artist duo Kovács/O’Doherty on their ‘sound and extraterrestrial radio installation’, Signal Tide, which was presented at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in September 2017. The work combines composed and generative music with the live signal of the LES-1, an abandoned satellite.
