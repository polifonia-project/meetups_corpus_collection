Together they recorded The American Music EP in 2004, which featured Fallon's mother on backing vocals.

This Charming Man's only full release was Every Little Secret in 2005, with the original lineup. Another song by the original band called "She Coulda Raised the Titanic" later became "1930" on the Gaslight Anthem's album, Sink or Swim.


=== The Gaslight Anthem (2006–2015, 2018) ===

Fallon has been the prominent song writer and vocalist for the Gaslight Anthem since their transition from This Charming Man.

On July 29, 2015, the band announced an indefinite hiatus after their European summer tour, which ended with an appearance at Reading Festival on August 30.
Fallon said of the band, "People will always say, 'why are you doing a solo record?' And I'm like, 'because I don't have anything to say with Gaslight'. Those five records, that's what you got. That's the piece. I feel it's a lot like The Replacements. There's no new music because that's all Paul [Westerberg] and the band has to say. When the book is over, it's over. And I have like… four-and-a-half records I'm really proud of."


=== The Horrible Crowes (2011–present) ===

== Personal life ==
Brian Fallon is a Christian, but he avoids using references to his faith in his music. As he stated in an interview with spinner.com referring to the Gaslight Anthem's 2010 album American Slang, "There are no religious songs and there never would be because the four of us, we all have different views, completely different religions...I'm very cautious not to push that on the band."Much of the lyrics on the Gaslight Anthem's 2014 album, Get Hurt were inspired by his divorce. Fallon said “Sometimes, I don’t even know how it happened. I don’t even know how it got like this. All I know is that it did. And I now have to figure out: What do I do now?" Fallon has since remarried and welcomed his second child.
