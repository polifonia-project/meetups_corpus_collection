Ferras' career began when he was in Amman with his father. He practiced music on a small keyboard that his father gave him and began to write his own songs. Ferras credits the keyboard for helping him through a lonely time while he was in Jordan.

After submitting a demo tape, he was invited to Florida where he signed with a manager and moved to Los Angeles.
