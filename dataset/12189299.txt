Brian "Red" Hurley (born 11 November 1947) is an Irish popular singer whose career has spanned several decades beginning in the 1970s. He is principally known as a solo artist, but he has also performed with various bands and pop groups, most notably The Nevada Showband, with whom he enjoyed his first series of number one records in the 1970s. He represented Ireland at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1976 with the song "When".Hurley tours regularly, performing at some of Ireland's principal concert venues. In August 2014, he was one of the musical soloists chosen to perform at the State Funeral of former Irish Prime Minister, Albert Reynolds.


== Personal life ==
Hurley was born in 1947 and grew up in Milltown, Dublin, with four brothers and two sisters.He has been married twice. His first marriage to top Dublin model Patricia Ward ended in the mid-1980s; they had one daughter together, Kimberley. He met his second wife, Norma, in 1990 when she was a dancer in one of his shows. They were together for 18 years before marrying in Dublin in 2008. The couple have two daughters, Kristina and Stephanie.


== Early career ==
Hurley started his career in 1969 as lead vocalist with The Colours. In 1970, he went on to form his first band, The Wheels, Hurley released several successful singles during this period with The Wheels including Isadora, Take Me Tonight and Poor Man's Roses, all of which made it into the Irish charts with Isadora being the best known of his hits from this period.


== Big Break ==
In early 1971, Hurley joined The Nevada, one of Ireland's top pop acts of that era, quickly becoming their most popular ever lead singer with a string of number 1 hits many penned by British songwriters Les Reed and Barry Mason specifically for Red. These include 'Sometimes. Kiss Me Goodbye and I never said Goodbye'. He enjoyed success with The Nevada until he left in 1974 to form his own "Red Hurley Band". The hits continued during the subsequent decade with 'Love Is All' (his biggest Reed/Mason hit and one of the biggest selling singles of the 1970s in Ireland), 'Broken Promises', 'Tennessee Special', 'You're my Day You're my Night' and many others, all huge chart hits in Ireland. Red toured extensively right up to the late 1980s. Throughout this time, despite domestic success in Ireland, where he was a major star, significant international success eluded him. Though signed to 'Redbus' one of the UK's premier agencies, the general feeling was that the marketing of a major Irish pop star was difficult at a time when the bombing campaign of the Provisional IRA on the UK mainland was at its height. Red's obvious Irish identity was considered an uphill battle for showbiz promoters in common with other Irish pop icons Joe Dolan and Dickie Rock, who also failed to find a significant enduring UK audience at that time despite being major stars in Ireland. Red's overall record in the Irish Charts places him among the biggest chart acts of all time in Ireland, with over 20 hits and five number ones. Altogether he has recorded over 500 songs in a career spanning the early seventies to the present day. He is still having chart hits in the 21st century giving him one of the longest chart careers in Irish show-business history.


== Eurovision Song Contest ==
In 1976 Hurley represented Ireland at the Eurovision Song Contest. Though one of the early favourites to win the contest, his song finished 10th on the night, beaten among others by the winning UK entry Brotherhood of Man and their song "Save Your Kisses for Me". Red's song "When" became a major chart hit in Ireland and is still popular today with Eurovision fans and regularly included in Red's live shows. "When" was written by Brendan Graham, who subsequently composed two Eurovision winning songs for Ireland, "Rock 'n' Roll Kids" in 1994 and "The Voice" for mezzo-soprano Eimear Quinn in 1996. He also composed the worldwide hit "You Raise Me Up", a major hit for Josh Groban in the U.S and Westlife in the UK.


== End of an era & new beginnings ==
Towards the end of the 1970s and into the 1980s, the Irish pop music scene underwent a period of significant change. Established artists like Hurley, whose careers had begun in the showband era, were making way for rock groups like U2 and others who were changing the music map in Ireland and internationally. Despite this, Red managed to maintain his career in Ireland throughout this time, albeit at a lower profile. In the 1990s, little was heard from the man whose voice had once ruled the Irish charts. In the 1990s new Irish pop acts such as Boyzone and Westlife emerged onto both the Irish & International scene. Both acts were managed by Hurley's one-time manager, X-Factor's Louis Walsh. Throughout this period, while his previously glittering chart career declined at home, Red Hurley moved to the United States, where he gradually made inroads into the market there. He would have to wait until 2003 for a return to the music charts with the release of a new album/CD "You're Still You". The album was a surprise success in Ireland, eventually leading to a successful comeback in the Irish market and a string of new recordings, as well as the international success (in both the UK and USA) which had previously eluded him.(See below). Gradually record sales increased, as did attendance at his live concert performances and Red managed to re-establish himself as a major live concert and cabaret artist. Regular appearances on high-profile TV and radio shows in Ireland, the UK and the USA followed.


== Today ==
Red Hurley now enjoys renewed success both in Ireland and the USA. In 2010 he celebrated 40 years in show business with a sell-out tour of Ireland with his special guest, legendary US Singer Rita Coolidge. The highlight was a sell-out show at Dublin's Grand Canal Theatre.  Pulitzer Prize-Winning American author Maya Angelou became an admirer of the singer and helped introduce him to American audiences. A greatest hits compilation 'Red Hurley – The Hits' reached the Irish top ten in 2009 and the singer also starred in a TV special for PBS in America in 2006, filmed before a live audience in Dublin's Olympia Theatre. Speaking in September 2010 of the renewed interest in his career, Red said that he was 'delighted and really enjoying his life again'. Kevin Myers, writing in the "Irish Independent" in September 2010 said, 'His intuitive sense of the beautiful is one reason why Red Hurley is such a wonderful singer. He will find the key element of any song – a single note or phrase – and elevate that into an unexpected little musical jewel'. Internet concert reviews blog Daniel Lindon Reviews said of Red, 'Rarely has an artist had the persistence and self-belief to rise above many career setbacks and emerge once again triumphant, he is one of the great male voices and his international success is long overdue'. 
Red Hurley continues to tour regularly in Ireland, USA and in the UK and his many recordings are now available to a whole new audience.
