Johnson was born in Montgomery, Alabama, United States, but from the age of two was raised in Massillon, Ohio.

He then spent time in Chicago, where he met Eric Dolphy, before moving to New York City in 1963.In the 1960s he worked with Charles Mingus, Hank Crawford, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Archie Shepp, and Hank Mobley on the album A Slice of the Top. He also began a long association with Gil Evans in 1966.
