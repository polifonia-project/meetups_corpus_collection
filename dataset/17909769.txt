A native of Kilkenny, Ó Lochlainn was a member of the Irish volunteers in 1916. He was part of a team which was sent to Kerry on Good Friday in a bid to seize radio equipment for communication with The Aud, a German ship transporting arms from Germany for the Easter Rising. He and a colleague, Denis Daly made it to their destination but a second car transporting three others crashed into the river at Ballykissane, Killorglin, killing three members of the team, Con Keating, Donal Sheehan and Charlie Monaghan.
Ó Lochlainn established the Candle Press in 1916. It was the winner of a bronze medal for bookbinding in 1924.
He founded his own press, At the Sign of the Three Candles Press, in 1926. He gave the aspiring piper Seamus Ennis his first job at this press, and Ennis collaborated with him on the Irish Street Ballads books. He succeeded Seamus Ó Casaide as volunteer editor of Irish Book Lover in 1930.
He was an assistant in the Faculty of Modern Irish at University College Dublin from 1933 to 1943, where he later became professor of Irish Language and Literature. He was also associated with the founding of An Óige.About 1940 he began the publication in Dublin of an undated series of penny Irish-language songsheets entitled An Claisceadal ("choral singing").  This was originally the name of an informal choral group of Irish-language enthusiasts which had been brought together in Dublin in 1928.He died in a nursing home in Dublin in June 1972 and was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.
