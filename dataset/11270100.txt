== Biography ==
Hawkins's drumming can be heard on dozens of hit singles, including tracks by Percy Sledge ("When a Man Loves a Woman"), Aretha Franklin ("Respect", "I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)" etc.), Wilson Pickett ("Mustang Sally", "Land of 1000 Dances"), The Staple Singers, Johnnie Taylor, Bobby Womack, Clarence Carter, Etta James, Duane Allman, Joe Cocker, Paul Simon, Bob Seger, Bonnie Bramlett, Bobby "Blue" Bland, Boz Scaggs, Albert King, Traffic, Rod Stewart, Dan Penn, Lulu, and Willie Nelson. He also recorded with Eric Clapton in the early 80's.

"Playing with the same guys for so long, well, it's really hard to impress Barry, David or Jimmy because they've heard me do it before.  And it's the same with them.  I mean, if Barry plays a hot lick, I don't congratulate him; he's supposed to do that.   I don't know what it is, but when the four of us sit down to play, it's almost like a burden has been lifted from our shoulders.  It's like, "Hey, we're home."
Hawkins died at age 75 at his home in Sheffield, Alabama. Hawkins had suffered from numerous health problems including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
