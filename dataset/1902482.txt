== Biography ==
Andrés Cabas was born on October 7, 1977 in Barranquilla, Colombia with music in his blood. His father, Eduardo Cabas is a well-known musician and composer in Colombia and Cabas’ formal education on the piano and percussion started while still a child. As a young adult Cabas traveled extensively, first to Paris and later to New York where – shy or not – he met and played with prominent jazz and salsa musicians. Upon his return to Colombia he dug deeply into his country’s rhythms and explored with a new wave of sound widely known in latin music at the time.
His first self-titled album, ‘Cabas’ (EMI) was released in 2000 and was an immediate hit, in particular the very successful single, “Mi Bombón” (“My Candy”) topped the country’s charts for three consecutive months earning him Gold and double Platinum discs before spreading to the rest of Latin-America and Mexico. Two other singles from the album also topped the charts not only in Colombia but throughout the Americas; “Ana Maria” and “Tu Boca”.
In March 2002, ‘Cabas’ was released in the United States, where it received a warm reception from critics as well as glowing reviews in Billboard magazine. and The New York Times. He made the New York Times -Best Of- list at the end of 2003.
Cabas chose to walk to the event instead of using a limousine when he was nominated for his first Best New Artist award in 2002. The compliments continued pouring in. He was nominated for Best Rock Album and Best Rock Interpretation.  At the MTV Latin Awards he was nominated for Best Rock Album, Best Rock Interpretation, the People's Prize and Best Rock Video for the Lo Nuestro Awards.


=== Children's music ===
In 2009, Cabas joined forces with renowned Theatre, Film & TV director Jorge Ali Triana for an adaptation of Mario Vargas Llosa’s “Pantaleón y las visitadoras”. He composed the music for this original version which earned him the Acede Prize of Theatrical Journalism in New York. He composed music for children in association with scientist and economist Gunter Pauli for the ZERI Foundation. Gunter Pauli is known for his charitable and philanthropic contributions and his music has been used in movies, on TV and in commercials around the globe.


=== Collaborations ===
Over the years Cabas has performed with artists like Lenny Kravitz, Shakira and Miguel Bosé. He has produced and co-produced with Kike Santander, December Bueno, Carlos Jean, collaborated with the Black Eyed Peas, Café Tacuba, Dave Matthews, Bunbury, Orishas, Vicentico, La Mala Rodríguez, Andrés Calamaro, Juan Luís Guerra and  Ximena Sariñana among many others. His music has been featured in commercials around the world and his videos have amassed tens of millions of views on YouTube.


=== Present ===
After the demise of his record label, Cabas took a few years off to travel and enjoy his newborn son, Simon. His return started in June 2013 with the release of; “Que Prenda La Moto” (‘The Engine Starts’). The song quickly became a top 10 hit in Colombia. He also released a duet with up and coming singer Duina del Mar, “Besarte La Boquita” (“Kissing Your Little Mouth”) Universal Music Latino.
In late 2015, Cabas released the single "Enamorandonos" (APM) in Colombia and later Ecuador. The single went straight to the top of the charts in both countries receiving extensive radio play. A highly creative, low budget but worldwide, video clip was released in February 2016 and is nearing 50 million plays. "Enamorandonos" was released to much success in Mexico in August 2016 and was included in the trailer for the Mexican hit movie "Treintona, Soltera y Fantástica" ('Thirty-ish, Single and Fabulous') starring Barbara Mori. Azteca TV included the song as the main theme for their show; Enamorandonos, which launched in November 2016 and has since moved to Azteca’s main channel 13. 

In May 2017 Cabas released his first ballad "Tanto Que Te Amo Tanto" co-written and produced with Colombian producer Jose Gaviria. The song about missing someone very close and dear, was written for his then 8-year-old son Simon. Cabas followed his first ballad with his first Cumbia-Reggaeton infused fusion single "Rompe Los Niveles", co-written with hit writer Descemer Bueno of "Baillando" fame. "Rompe Los Niveles" was released in July 2017, immediately inspired a storm of fans. In August 2017 Cabas performed the song for the first time live at the VIBRA Bogota radio TYM Festival in front of 15,000 plus people. The music video for "Rompe Los Niveles" - a major production directed by the Spanish directing team Javi Rojo and Fini Mazza and shot in Miami - was launched at the end of September 2017.
In May 2018 Cabas released his first ever English language song; "To Stay". It is the result of his fans' strong appeal for an English version of the hit ballad; "Tanto Que Te Amo Tanto". "To Stay" was also co-written and produced with José Gaviria in Miami. In the first few days of its release, Cabas’ "To Stay" made Spotify’s Baladas Románticas playlist.
"Tanto Que Te Amo Tanto" was followed by “Valiente”, another slightly reggaeton infused pop song in 2018. Cabas opened the Central American Games in Barranquilla, with Miss Universe 2015 Paulina Vega and Shakira to great reviews, in front of more than 55,000 people and a massive live television audience around the world. And he closed the Colombian soccer season that same year, again in front of a massive live and live TV audience.
And now there is “Amor Y Traicion”.
The recent coronavirus pandemic has had numerous effects on Cabas. For Cabas, finding his bearings in these trying times has resulted in a new perspective and a major creative outburst, resulting in a series of singles and a new album coming out over the next 5 months.The start is Amor Y Traicion– written and produced with Grammy winning producer George Noriega and his team at the Cutting Cane studios in Miami; Mixed by Luis Barrera Jr. Mastered by – Francisco Holzmann. Amor Y Traicion and the accompanying highly original animated video created in Argentina by Federico and Nicolas Raiman, are Cabas’ clear-eyed perspective of these trying times and how we will come through the dark days similar to his own experience. Not your typical Latin music message and certainly worth a look. “AMOR Y TRAICION” was released on May 29, 2020. In 2021, Cabas released "Divina" an anthemn to the city of Bogotá, "Trato Y No Consigo", which speaks about the importance of family and includes a music video featuring his son, Simón, and "Solos Ft. Martina La Peligrosa" a seductive single with Colombian actress and singer, Martina La Peligrosa, which has reached the #6 spot in Colombian's music charts.
