== Musicology ==
Holoman was one of the founding editors of the journal 19th-Century Music in 1977 (with Joseph Kerman and Robert Winter) and later served as its managing editor. His 1974 doctoral dissertation on Berlioz was the beginning of a what would be the focus of his musical scholarship for many years. The dissertation, with revisions and corrections, was published in 1980 as The Creative Process in the Autograph Musical Documents of Hector Berlioz, c. 1818–1840. In 1987, he published the first complete catalogue of the works of Hector Berlioz, and in 1989 he published Berlioz, his 687-page biography of the composer. He also edited the critical edition of the Roméo et Juliette score for the new edition of the complete works of Berlioz, published by Bärenreiter in 1990.
Holoman's interest in Berlioz and 19th century French orchestral music led to two further books—a comprehensive history of the Société des Concerts du Conservatoire (2004) and a biography of the conductor and champion of Berlioz's music, Charles Munch (2011).
