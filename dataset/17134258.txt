In the fall of 2010, the 20 members were divided into pairs to form 10 groups. Fans then voted on which duo would perform their own track on the next single. Team Gakuran was the winner and performed the track "Ichikoi" on the Yarakai Heart single.

In Summer 2010, a song "Makehende" was introduced at Shinahachi Live in NGK. The song was originally written only for this event but due to demand from fans, the song then applied to USEN Music Program. The song entered USEN ranking top 50 and decided to be included in Idoling!!! 4th album "SISTERS" released in 2011 . A music video then created after the song managed to enter top 30.


== Idoling!!! Programs ==
Idoling!!! TV show is airing in three different medias; the CS, the On Demand, and the Terrestrial broadcast. Each has different packaging.


=== Fuji TV CS ===
The Idoling!!! program started on October 30, 2006, airing every weekday on two Fuji TV's satellite channels, Fuji TV 739 (also formerly on Fuji TV 721) and Fuji TV CSHD. On this version, the TV show is unedited. Since 2009, the show is airing two and three times per week. Since the show is unedited, mistakes and happenings can be seen sometimes throughout the show, for example was episode 459.
The show is a variety show, making each airing different. However, there are a few recurring core segments.

Other segments 
These segments are fairly new or do not appear as frequently as the above. Segments will often gain temporary popularity with the staff and fans, resulting in recurring airings for a short period, followed by a period where the once-popular segment does not air at all.


=== Fuji TV On Demand ===
Fuji TV On Demand is a paid streaming service. The On Demand duration of each episode depends on the filming, sometimes it can be 40 minutes long with the first 27 minutes the same as broadcast on the CS version. On Demand currently streams in MP4 format (1280x720 pixels, 2000 kbit/s bitrate).


=== Fuji TV Terrestrial ===
The terrestrial channel is known as Fuji TV main channel(CX), which is free but only available around Tokyo. The show known as Chijōha-han (地上波版), formerly Idoling!!! Nikki (アイドリング!!!日記). Idoling!!! show in this broadcast is edited to fit the 30 minutes slot with commercials, sometimes cramped two CS episodes into one. The edit includes narration, additional captions, and extra segment which is not available on other broadcasts. One of those segments is ARG started on December 29, 2012.


=== uRaIdoling!!! ===
uRaIdoling is a special collection of Idoling episodes available only to fanclub members. These episodes feature a behind-the-scenes look at the various activities of the members (and occasionally the staff) when they are not filming the main show. These episodes are not constrained to any format and cover topics and subjects with no specificity. Some examples of episodes include visiting member's houses, cooking with members, games or discussions between small groups of members, solo interviews, photo-shoot documentaries, and PV "making of" documentaries.


=== Gekkan Idoling!!! ===
Gekkan Idoling can be considered Idoling's monthly specials. These episodes feature off-location activities such as cooking lessons, camping trips, games. They are similar to uRaIdoling in their miscellaneousness, though they are longer in length and feature most, if not all, members.
The full episodes were later released in a longer format on DVD for fan club members. After a year, Gekkan Idoling!!! became a direct-to-DVD production without TV broadcast.

Since April 17, 2012, Idoling!!! started its official YouTube channel. Other than streaming old collections of TV show episode and Gekkan Idoling!!!, it also streams 2–3 minutes video called "Daily Idoling!!!"
