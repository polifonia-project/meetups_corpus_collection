Shortly after the split, Burke was contacted by Will Sergeant and eventually joined the Bunnymen as lead vocalist. The band released Reverberation (1990) to mostly negative reviews, though the album has subsequently garnered some acclaim. The Bunnymen formally announced their disbandment in 1993.
In 2005, Burke reformed St. Vitus Dance for some live shows, and an album of new material, Glyphotheque, was released in 2008.
