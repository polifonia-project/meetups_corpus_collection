== Biography ==
Hough was born in Heswall (then in Cheshire) on the Wirral Peninsula, and grew up in Thelwall, where he began piano lessons at the age of five. His father, who was born in Australia, worked as a technical representative for British Steel before his death at the age of 54. At an early age, Hough was able to memorise about 100 nursery rhymes and, after much pleading, his parents agreed to buy a second-hand piano, for £5 from a local antique shop, for the home. At the age of 12 he suffered what he has described as a "mini-nervous breakdown", triggered by a mugging incident, which resulted in him taking almost a year off school. He studied at Chetham's School of Music, which he later described as "not a wonderful place while I was there", and at the Royal Northern College of Music. In 1978, he was a finalist in the BBC Young Musician of the Year Competition and won the piano section. In 1982, he won the Terence Judd Award in England. In 1983, he took first prize at the Naumburg International Piano Competition in New York City.
Hough holds a master's degree from the Juilliard School where his studies were assisted by the receipt of the first Royal Philharmonic Society Julius Isserlis Scholarship for study abroad. He has studied with Heather Slade-Lipkin, Gordon Green, Adele Marcus, Martin Canin, and Derrick Wyndham. A prominent soloist, he is also a composer and transcriber, and often includes his own works in his recitals. He has published over 30 pieces. The premiere of his cello concerto, written for Steven Isserlis, took place in March 2007, and in the summer of the same year Westminster Abbey and Westminster Cathedral performed masses he wrote for them.  In 2009, his trio for piccolo, contrabassoon and piano ('Was mit den Traenen geschieht') was premiered at the Philharmonie in Berlin by members of the Berlin Philharmonic. His song cycles 'Herbstlieder' (2007) and 'Other Love Songs' (2010) and 'Dappled Things' (2016) were premiered by members of The Prince Consort. His 'Sonata for Piano (broken branches)' was premiered by himself at the Wigmore Hall in 2011. In 2012 the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and Symphonic Choir gave the world premiere of the orchestrated version of his Missa Mirabilis. This work was recorded in 2015 by the Colorado Symphony and Andrew Litton for Hyperion Records. He has written four sonatas for solo piano. In 2020 his anthology of essays Rough Ideas won the Royal Philharmonic Society Award for the Storytelling Category.

== Recordings ==
He has recorded more than 60 CDs, one of his most notable being a set of the four Rachmaninoff piano concertos and the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, recorded during live performances with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra under the baton of then music director Andrew Litton, which have been compared to the recordings by the composer himself.  These recordings won him his seventh Gramophone Award as well as the Classical BRIT Critics Award.

== Australian connections ==
Hough's father was born an only child at Mayfield, a suburb of Newcastle, New South Wales, in 1926.  Before his first birthday his mother took him to England, settling in the North, and leaving her husband behind in Australia. The boy was always told his father had died, but in fact the father lived for a further 30 years, working in the steel industry at Newcastle.  Hough's grandfather wrote Hough's father letters, none of which he ever received.
Stephen Hough says his assumption of Australian citizenship was in part a tribute to his father, who wanted to return to the land of his birth but was never able to do so before his death in 1980 at the age of 54.
