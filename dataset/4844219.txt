Carl-Michael Eide (born 24 July 1974) is a Norwegian black metal musician, multi-instrumentalist, and vocalist. He is also known under stage names Aggressor, Czral and Exhurtum.


== Biography ==
Carl-Michael Eide has played in various black metal and avant-garde metal bands. These include Ved Buens Ende, Aura Noir, Cadaver, Dødheimsgard, Satyricon, Ulver, Infernö and recently the jazz/rock band Virus. His drumming is unusual in style, with very little repetition and a tendency to shy away from traditional drumming.
His singing abilities are diverse. Other than usual harsh vocals in black metal, he uses a form of croon in the avant-garde metal bands Ved Buens Ende and Virus.
He has gone back to playing guitar and was writing music for the re-grouped Ved Buens Ende, before the band once again split up in early 2007.  Beyond that, he continues to write material for Aura Noir and Virus.
He was also a session drummer for Dimmu Borgir on their 1997 tour.
On 26 March 2005 he fell from a four-story building and spent several months in hospital. He has lost the use of his feet as a result of the incident. He is not able to play drums anymore, but is still active as a vocalist, guitarist and bassist.
