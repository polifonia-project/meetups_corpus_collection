Silvano Monasterios (born October 30, 1964) is a Venezuelan jazz musician, pianist, composer and orchestrator.Born in Caracas, Monasterios has been considered as one of the major jazz artists to emerge from Venezuela.

Known for his lyrical style of playing, Monasterios was particularly influenced by the work of Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett and McCoy Tyner. He received formal musical training at the José Angel Lamas School of Music and began his professional career at the age of 18, combining this knowledge and these influences by performing and recording with some of the most prominent Venezuelan artists of the time.In 1989, Monasterios traveled to Miami, Florida to participate in the Miami Jazz Festival, where he earned an award for Best Instrumental Soloist performance, which granted him a scholarship from Miami Dade College. He then moved to the United States in 1990 to attend college, and later received other recognition from the University of Colorado in 1991, earning Outstanding Soloist award honors.Entering 1997, Monasterios released his first album, Roads Not Taken, to expand his own sound world with a selection of eight original compositions, which featured upright bassist Marc Johnson and multi-instrumentalist Ira Sullivan among other invitees. After that, he received a music scholarship from the University of Miami, from which he earned a Bachelor of Music degree in 1995.
