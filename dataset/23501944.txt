Yuksek was born in Reims, France. Yuksek played the piano at the Conservatoire of Music until the age of 17 – the time he decided to give up his studies. After playing the piano for ten years at a conservatoire, he took part in several bands such as Klanguage, whose first album was released in 2007.
He created his first tracks as Yuksek in 2002 and then started to perform successfully as a DJ all over the world. At the same time, his first EPs and remixes were released on labels such as Relish, I'm a Cliché, Kitsuné, Exploited and Citizen.
His debut album, Away from the Sea, was released on February 9, 2009. Featuring the singles Tonight and Extraball, this album received a lot of media attention, including an interview on the popular French TV talk show Le Grand Journal on premium pay television channel Canal+. Tonight was also selected as the soundtrack for the show in January 2009. His track Extraball was featured in a commercial for the Airness "Attraction" deodorant, as well as Lacoste Red ! collection in 2009. His track Tonight has also been chosen for the Peugeot commercial "Alchemy", part of a major brand revival, that was broadcast on French TV from January 2010.
Yuksek has also been involved in many other musical projects such as The Krays (with Brodinski) and Peter & The Magician (with Stephen Fasano, ex-Aeroplane).
After touring for 2 years, Yuksek released his second album, Living on the Edge of Time, on June 13, 2011. This album – like the debut single "On a Train" – took a pop direction while retaining Yuksek's electronic flow.
