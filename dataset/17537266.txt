Jason Carter, better known by the stage name Mad Doctor X (also known as DJ Jason, Jazzy Jason, Jay Rock, London Funk Allstars, DJ Toolz and Clusterfunk) is a British DJ.


== Biography ==
Carter ran the Blapps! Records label, which released several records from 1988–1992 that were club hits in the Baltimore area, as well as in the British rave scene. "Don't Hold Back", "Too Much Energy", and "Let the Freak" were sampled and played heavily by DJs and producers in the Baltimore club scene. The label had two sublabels: Pure Bhoomie and Ruff Lick Records.
Carter and Aston Harvey of Freestylers formed Blapps Posse, a production team active in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Their music combined house and hip hop influences, with strong bass lines and house breaks, fused with rap vocals and beats.
