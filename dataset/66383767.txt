== Biography ==

El Boza has commented that since childhood he had an interest in football, and wanted to perform as a professional footballer. However, for various reasons he decided to go into music.

== Career ==
Boza started his music career in 2014, when he was just 16 years old. His first song was "Canelas", but his popularity was ignited with "Bandolera", a collaboration with Panamanian singers Yemil and Tachi. He was one of the fresh faces of the new wave of Panamanians that with dancehall, reggae in Spanish, trap and explicit content flowed in a musical category that they called "canela". They were immediately criticized by artists from the past and tried to censor them, as is often the case with sounds created by a young generation. The Chombo legendary figure of Latin music is one of the main detractors of "canela".In April 2017, he joined the record label Panama Music, led by Januario Crespo, who signed the rights to represent the idol. In the following years, he released songs such as "Ratas y ratones", "Lollipop" and "Me mató", which allowed him to obtain international recognition. This musical credit goes to Panamanian record producer Irving Quintero "Faster", who asserts that the artist will continue to maintain his essence, confirming the talent and versatility he possesses when it comes to interpretation. In April 2019, he signed with Sony Music Latin, thus becoming the first Panamanian artist to sign with the record company.In June 2019, he announced that his debut album was in development. In September of the same year, he released the first single from the album entitled "En 4 Vente". In February 2020, Boza released his debut extended play, Sonrisas Tristes, which includes the single "Party en mi Casa", which peaked at number three in Panama. Later, on July 31, 2020, Boza released his debut studio album, Más Negro que Rojo, which includes the songs "Bandida", which became Boza's highest-charting single in Panama, debuting at number two; and "Hecha Pa' Mi", that became a commercial success in Latin America, Europe and the United States, after earning popularity on the video-sharing app TikTok.
