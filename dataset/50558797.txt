RiceGum has also been involved in controversies with other popular YouTubers and musicians such as James Rallison, Gabbie Hanna, and Bhad Bhabie.


=== Hong Kong vlog controversy ===
On June 12, 2018, RiceGum uploaded a video of himself in Hong Kong through his main YouTube channel. In the video, he asks strangers and a staff member in a local McDonald's if they have dog on the menu as he says "Asians eat cats and dogs in China." He also jokes about wanting to have dog and cat meat to eat as he is "always open to try new things". He comments on Hong Kong street food beef entrails, questioning if it is dog meat and saying "shit looks disgusting". He filmed comedian M2THAK walking up to a man in the Hong Kong International Airport, yelling "Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?", allegedly imitating a scene from the Hollywood movie Rush Hour starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker to imply that Asian communities do not understand English. M2THAK was also filmed repositioning mannequins in a store window into sexually suggestive poses. The video included a scene where they gave a half-eaten ice cream to a local Hong Kong man.Online commentary has compared the video to Logan Paul's Japan vlog controversy, saying that he is being disrespectful and culturally insensitive in a foreign country. Jimmy Wong tweeted saying that he is disappointed as RiceGum's videos are now "disrespectful, ignorant, borderline racist, & shameful to all creators, especially Asians" and asked him to "please grow up & stop".Two weeks later, on June 26, when the video received different criticism in China and other Asian countries, RiceGum released a video, saying that he was just "joking around". He defended himself saying that he was just trying to use Asian stereotypes to point to American comedy culture and that people are being too sensitive. He further explained that he believed it is acceptable as he is Asian. He also said that he wanted to return to Hong Kong, but says that he is "kind of scared now because the people may hit me and beat me up". However, the video was considered insincere; media site Polygon described that his apology was done "in a somewhat glib manner" and What's Trending said the "apology" "sounded [incredibly] forced". The video of his Hong Kong tour is currently removed from YouTube due to the violation of YouTube's Terms of Service.


=== Mystery box website promotion ===
In January 2019, RiceGum, along with Jake Paul, came under fire for promoting MysteryBrand, a website which offers the chance to open a digital "mystery box" of pre-selected items with a promise to win one in real life at random. Many users have said they have not received prizes they won through the site, and concluded the site is a scam. In response, RiceGum made a video in which he pointed out that other YouTubers made their own videos promoting MysteryBrand months prior, saying "No-one said anything, it wasn't a problem back then. Why did no-one bring it up, or even talk about these guys? This mystery box thing has been on the internet for 3 or 4 months even from other creators, but as soon as I do it, it's a problem?" At the end of the video, he decided to give away Amazon gift card codes, saying "There's nothing I can really do but say sorry and give you these Amazon gift cards". However, many people called him out for the Amazon codes already being expired.


=== Save The Kids Token ===
In June 2021, RiceGum along with members of FaZe Clan were influencer ambassadors for a crypto token called Save The Kids (KIDS) which was marketed as a charity token meant to give a percentage of the transaction fee to the Binance Charity Wallet. The token was then pumped and dumped by many of the ambassadors and the token's value quickly crashed shortly after when it was released.
