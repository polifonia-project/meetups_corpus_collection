Frances Elaine Keillor C.M. (born 2 September 1939) is a Canadian musicologist and pianist. She has been a professor of music at Carleton University since 1977, specializing in the music of Canadian composers and the music of North American indigenous groups.


== Early life and education ==
Elaine Keillor was born in London, Ontario in 1939. Her first piano teacher was her mother, Lenore Stevens Keillor, although Keillor has said of her mother, "She said that she could not actually recall teaching me to play the piano as I would just go to the instrument and
play what she had been teaching the last student."Elaine also took lessons with Reginald Bedford, and later with Claudio Arrau and Harold Craxton.
She progressed rapidly and at age 10 she earned an ARCT certificate from The Royal Conservatory of Music. At the time, she was the youngest person to receive an ARCT, and her record stood for six decades.Keillor played in recitals, and as soloist with several orchestras in Canada and the United States. She completed her secondary school education through homeschooling, then moved to Europe for further study and performing, including a 1962 performance in the Soviet Union.While still in her teens, she returned to Canada, and in 1959 embarked on a performing tour of 23 Canadian communities.A chronic hand injury that began around this time curtailed her performing schedule. Keillor then began studies at the University of Toronto. She earned a B.A. in 1970, an M.A. in musicology the following year, and a Ph.D. in 1976, the first woman to receive a doctorate in musicology from the university.
