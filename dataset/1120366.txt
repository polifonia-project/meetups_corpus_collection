Kurt Reinhard (27 August 1914 – 18 July 1979) was a German musicologist and ethnomusicologist who specialised in Turkish music.
Born in Gießen, Germany, he studied musicology and composition at the University of Cologne from 1933–1935, and ethnology at the Universities of Leipzig and Munich from 1935-1936. He took his doctorate at Munich doing his dissertation on Burmese music. In 1952–1968 he was a director of the Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv.
His chief area of interest in the field of ethnomusicology was the folk music of Turkey.
