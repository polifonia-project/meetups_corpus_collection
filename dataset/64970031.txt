== Artistry ==
Musically, Wolf performs in what she describes as "funky soul pop" in terms of genre. In a 2021 interview, Wolf states she wants to "constantly try to innovate the sound of pop music" and "erase the rules of pop." The New York Times wrote that she turns the genre bedroom pop into "hypercolored explosions". She chooses to experiment with upbeat, unconventional sounds to produce unique songs that connect to her personal life experiences. She gains her inspiration and love for music from various artists such as Still Woozy, SZA, and John Mayer.


== Personal life ==
Wolf is openly bisexual, and has been based in Los Angeles, California, since circa 2014. In June 2020, she was checked into rehab for her alcoholism issues. She claims to have been sober ever since, and that in past instances she frequently drank to the point of blacking out, and although she could easily function in daily life, she had started fighting with family, friends and collaborators.
