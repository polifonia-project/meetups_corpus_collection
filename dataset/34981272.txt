== Biography ==
Jung Jae-hyung was born in Seoul and graduated from Hanyang University's College of Music, with a major in composition. Before his debut, he was not affected by any kind of pop music and immersed only in classical music. He made his debut in K-pop in 1995 as part of the group 'Basis(베이시스)' with his college classmates. Basis had its heyday with the success of several titles across three albums.
In 1999, the band split and Jung went to France to attend École Normale de Musique de Paris. During his staying in Paris, he specialized in film music and piano performance and participated in four film productions in South Korea.
In 2008 he returned to Korea and released his third album entitled "For Jacqueline", six years after his last album dedicated to the public. In April 2009 he released regular album entitled "Promenade" and in 2010, the piano music album "Le Petit Piano" was released.
In 2010 he made an appearance in IU's MV Good Day.
From March 4, 2012, with the all-time top K-pop star Lee Hyori, Jung has been hosting the music show Jung Jae-hyung & Lee Hyo-ri's You and I on SBS.
