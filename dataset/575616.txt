== Career ==
In 1992, Mitchell released his first album called Runnin' Off at da Mouth under the name Tung Twista.
His second album, titled Resurrection, was set to be released in 1994, but due to problems with his record label at the time Atlantic Records and marketing issues involving fellow Chicago rapper Common's album of the same name, the album was only released in the city of Chicago and thus got little national attention.
In 1996, he teamed with Chicago producer The Legendary Traxster and Cwal's Do or Die on the track "Po Pimp" produced by the Legendary Traxster, which became a hit single. This led to a Cwal's label deal with Atlantic Records, which released Adrenaline Rush in 1997. Twista had by then dropped the "Tung" from his stage name.  Adrenaline Rush became Twista's first charting album, as it peaked at #77 on the Billboard Hot 200.
