Brett Kissel (born May 27, 1990) is a Canadian country singer. He has had four number-one hits on the Canadian country chart with "Airwaves", "Drink About Me", "A Few Good Stories", and "Make a Life, Not a Living".


== Early life ==
Kissel, a fifth generation Albertan, was born in St. Paul, Alberta, the son of Brenda and Gordon Kissel. He has one older brother, Jamison. He grew up on a cattle ranch in northeastern Alberta's Flat Lake region, where his family operates the Wengzynowski North View cattle ranch. The ranch, named for his great great-grandparents Wasyl and Paraska Wengzynowski, was homesteaded in 1910, and raises Angus and Speckle Park-cross cattle. The lyrics to his song "Country in my Blood", released on Warner Music Canada in October 2013, tell about his family's journey to Canada, and his experience growing up in rural Alberta.When Kissel was six, his grandmother bought him his first guitar from the Sears catalogue for Christmas 1996. Kissel took lessons for one year in his hometown of St. Paul, and further developed his guitar-playing style through frequent attendance at the Freddie Pelletier Guitar Camp.
During a chance meeting in 1995, Kissel met Alberta country star, philanthropist, and fundraising auctioneer Danny Hooper, during a school fundraiser in St. Paul, Alberta.  According to multiple interviews, this was Kissel's first public performance, as Hooper called the youngster onstage to perform his local hit "The John Deere Tractor Keys" in front of a sold-out audience.  This sparked a friendship between Kissel and Hooper that led to their professional management relationship that started in 2005.
