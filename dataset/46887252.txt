In the years that followed Henry appeared on a few of Hugh Laurie's albums, and he toured all over the world with Laurie, as a regular member of The Copper Bottom Band (playing a whole range of blowing instruments, including saxophones, clarinet and harmonica), ever since Laurie started touring and playing concerts as a professional blues musician.Henry's work with Tom Waits and with Hugh Laurie was noted and highly acclaimed by the music reviews, but it was his work (and especially the extensive touring) with Hugh Laurie that finally exposed him to and got him discovered by the general audience.In 2021 Henry took part in the creation of the soundtrack music from the motion picture The United States vs. Billie Holiday (and is credited for Bass, Clarinet, Guitar and Saxophone playing + Horn Arrangements for most of the tracks in that recording).
