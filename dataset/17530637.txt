== Critical reaction ==
Mark Gilbert of Jazz Journal has made the following observation of Lundgren: "He [began] as a classically trained pianist and the practice is unmistakable in the pinpoint precision, lurid articulation, unerring melodic sense and apparently effortless range that characterise his piano playing; he quickly creates a sense of musical security and trust."Commenting on Lundgren's 2011 album Together Again ...At The Jazz Bakery, US jazz critic Doug Ramsey wrote: "Mr. Lundgren's clarity of execution matches the clarity of his ideas. He is at the top of his game in all of the elements of jazz pianism: touch, dynamics, harmonic imagination, swing, power and delicacy".In his review of Lundgren's 2013 solo album Man in the Fog, Jazz Journal critic Michael Tucker cited two tracks as "delicious examples of this wide-ranging pianist’s clarity of ideas and phrasing and simultaneous delicacy and purposiveness of touch."In a September 2014 interview with Lundgren published by Marc Myers on his JazzWax blog, Myers said of the Trio's Flowers of Sendai album: "There’s enormous beauty here in chord voicings and how they resolve. It's impossible not to be moved by the delicacy and beauty."


== Ystad Sweden Jazz Festival ==
In 2010, together with Thomas Lantz, Lundgren founded the annual Ystad Sweden Jazz Festival (YSJF), for which he is Artistic Director. YSJF, which takes place around the first weekend of August each year, has quickly become one of Europe's leading jazz festivals, involving some 40 concerts by international and Swedish artists.

The 2014 festival featured performances by, among others, Charles Lloyd, John Scofield, Abdullah Ibrahim, Diane Schuur, Joshua Redman, Enrico Rava and Roy Hargrove. YSJF 2015, which ran from 29 July to 2 August, saw concerts by artists including Nils Landgren, Dianne Reeves, Karin Krog, Lars Danielsson Group, Viktoria Tolstoy, Robert Glasper Trio, Kenny Barron and Dave Holland.The festival is attended by approximately 7,000 people, of which 20% are from outside Sweden. Around 80-100 journalists from a variety of countries are accredited by the festival each year. Well-known jazz writers who have been at and reported on YSJF include Ira Gitler, Michael Tucker and Doug Ramsey.
