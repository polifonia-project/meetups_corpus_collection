André Anjos was born in 1985 in Coimbra, Portugal, to a US-American mother and a Portuguese father. Anjos's family moved frequently and he has stated that he attended “ten different schools” until his parents settled in Santa Maria da Feira, near Porto. Anjos took up playing the piano when he was 6 and got his first guitar when he was 13. He lived in the US for a time with his parents in the mid-1990s and went back in 2005 to study Music, Media, and Entertainment Business at Greenville College in Illinois. At college he met his wife Liz, who was a piano major. They moved to Portland after graduating and have been based there since. As a musician, Liz Anjos performs under the name Pink Feathers. Anjos' parents and brother also live in the US.


== Music career ==


=== Founding Remix Artist Collective ===
The Remix Artist Collective was created in January 2007 by André Allen Anjos, after recruiting fellow online remixers Aaron Jasinski and
Chris Angelovski. Originally from Porto, Portugal, Anjos founded RAC in Greenville, Illinois, U.S. while he was a student at Greenville College, and became coordinator of the Remix Artist Collective. Later, Andrew Maury (New York City) and Karl Kling (Portland) joined RAC. RAC's first release was "Sleeping Lessons (RAC Mix)" for The Shins, earning the remix a spot as a B-Side on the single release for "Australia." The mix, along with several other projects garnered interest among bands like Tokyo Police Club, Bloc Party, and Ra Ra Riot.RAC's 2008 Sega Vs. Nintendo EP spurred interest by bloggers and earned a headline from the gaming site Kotaku. In addition to the mention and posting of remixes by online publications such as Pitchfork Media and Brooklyn Vegan, RAC has received more formal recognition in a full-length feature cover article for the St. Louis Riverfront Times, an online interview with Stereo Subversion, and an exclusive free mp3 debut through Stereogum.

Anjos now resides in the USA. The title refers to the fact that the album was primarily made on line, with Anjos never meeting most of the collaborators in real life. Outside of remixing, Anjos has done work creating original music content for HBO's Entourage, and was a principal member of the indie-electronica band, The Pragmatic until its end in 2010. RAC also composed and performed the soundtrack for the videogame Master Spy.

== Style and influences ==
The vision of the Remix Artist Collective was to maintain a style of remixing that strays from the "club mix" archetype, creating new incarnations of songs that stem from the original structure, but expand on their genre and musical arrangement. Early RAC mixes typically feature a blend of hip-hop and vintage drum machine samples, analog synthesizers, melodic hooks, and original instrumentation performed by the remix artists themselves.Annie Zaleski of the Riverfront Times wrote of Anjos' style: "Unlike many electronic remixes, which are commonly technical and precise, RAC mixes embody a unique aesthetic built on emotion and nuance, an almost intangible warmth and innate playfulness." Anjos' signature remixing sound is in large part a result of some of his equipment, notably, a 1982 Roland Juno-60 and 1973 Univox MiniKorg, though he has also been known to manipulate analog tape machines to achieve effects, and primarily works with Ableton Live to do so.
