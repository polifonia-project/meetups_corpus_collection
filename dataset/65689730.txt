=== 2013–2017: Career beginnings ===
In 2013, Sada Baby began taking rapping seriously and cultivated a following. He released numerous songs and was featured on a number of tracks in the next three years, but received little attention. He nearly quit in 2016 until entering and winning a local rap competition, beating out 12 other rappers and earning money. Sada began releasing a series of singles and music on YouTube, culminating in the release of his breakout debut mixtape, Skuba Sada, in 2017. That same year, he also signed to his friend Tee Grizzley's record label Grizzley Gang, and released another mixtape called D.O.N - Dat One Nigga.
