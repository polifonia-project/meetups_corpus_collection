Mark Beyer (born October 8, 1950) is a self-taught American artist and former cartoonist. His comics were known for their bleak story lines, often featuring death, disfigurement, depression, and humiliation, which contrasted with his self-taught, geometric drawing style. Most of his stories were about the adventures of a codependent yet resentful couple named Amy and Jordan. Beyer made one final comic strip for the summer 2012 issue of the British magazine Art Review. He is primarily known as a self-taught outsider artist.


== Biography ==
Beyer is originally from Allentown, Pennsylvania, in the state's Lehigh Valley region. He is a self-taught, outsider artist who has appeared in Raw Vision Magazine.
Beyer's work was prominently featured in all but two issues (#3 and 4) of Raw magazine.   He has also been published in New York Press and New Musical Express. Beyer also had a recurring animated short series on MTV's Liquid Television (The Adventures of Thomas and Nardo); and a 1995 movie by Gregg Araki, The Doom Generation, was loosely based on the Amy and Jordan strips.
He has also produced cover artwork, including Xman and *** by Michael Brodsky, T-shirts and posters for John Zorn and the New York Downtown avant-garde music scene. In particular the cover and inserts for Zorn's tribute to Ornette Coleman Spy vs Spy (1989) and a popular Naked City T-shirt.
Although he mostly works solo, Beyer has collaborated with writer Alan Moore.
