== Biography ==
Traoré's father was a diplomat and she travelled widely in her youth. She visited Algeria, Saudi Arabia, France and Belgium and was exposed to a wide variety of influences. Her hometown of Kolokani is in the northwestern part of Mali's Koulikoro region.
While the Bambara have a tradition of griot performing at weddings, members of the nobility, such as Rokia, are discouraged from performing as musicians. Rokia attended lycée in Mali while her father was stationed in Brussels and started performing publicly as a university student in Bamako. She plays acoustic guitar as well as sings, and uses vocal harmonies in her arrangements which are rare in Malian music. She also plays ngoni (lute) and balafon.
In 1997 Traoré linked with Mali musician Ali Farka Touré which raised her profile.
She was selected to be on the jury for the main competition section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.


== Recordings ==
Her first album Mouneïssa (Label Bleu), released in late 1997 in Mali and September 1, 1998 in Europe, was acclaimed for its fresh treatment and unqualifiable combinations of several Malian music traditions such as her use of the ngoni and the balafon. It sold over 40,000 copies in Europe.
On July 11, 2000, her second album Wanita was released. Traoré wrote and arranged the entire album.
Her 2003 album Bowmboï has two tracks recorded with the Kronos Quartet but still sung in the Bamana language.
Her album Tchamantché was released on May 6, 2008, followed in 2013 by her album Beautiful Africa.
She wrote the music for the 2011 Toni Morrison play Desdemona.


== Personal life ==
From 2013 to 2018, Traoré had a relationship with Jan Goossens, a Belgian playwright and artistic director with whom she has a daughter, born in Belgium in 2015. Since their separation in 2018, the couple have been in conflict over custody of their daughter.In March 2019 Traoré accused Goossens of sexually touching their daughter and deprived him of any contact with the child outside Mali. Goossens appealed to the Belgian courts and reported the charges against him. In a provisional judgment, the judge decided that the child would have to spend part of the summer vacation with the father. Traoré ignored this legal judgment. Next the Brussels court of first instance granted the father the child's main residence while deciding that parental authority would remain joint, and that custody would be shared. For her part, Traoré filed three complaints against Goossens, whom she accuses of sexually touching their daughter. A first complaint in Belgium, in July 2019, was dismissed. A few months later, she filed a second complaint in Mali, and then another complaint in France. Malian justice, seized well after the first judgment of the Belgian justice and the international arrest warrant, decided for its part to grant Traoré sole custody of her daughter in a provisional order.
In October 2019, Belgian courts issued an international arrest warrant against Traoré for "kidnapping, forcible confinement and hostage-taking". She was given, however, a period of a few months to present the child. Not having respected the final deadline of 22 February 2020 granted by the Belgian justice, Traoré was arrested on 10 March 2020 in Paris. She was stopping over there on her way to Belgium to attend the appeal hearing she made. Incarcerated in Fleury-Mérogis prison, she immediately began a hunger strike. Released under judicial supervision, she fled to Mali: "I am a mother who protects her children. So I packed my bags, headed for the airport, took a legal private plane. By virtue of the protection afforded to me by my Malian diplomatic passport, I was able to leave".
