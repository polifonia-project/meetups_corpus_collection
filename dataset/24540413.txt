Tyler Mathew Carl Williams (born February 25, 1988), professionally known as T-Minus, is a Canadian record producer. He has produced hit records and worked with many popular artists including Lil Wayne,  Eminem, Drake, Nicki Minaj, The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar, Camila Cabello, Travis Scott, Justin Bieber, Belly, ASAP Rocky, Big Sean, DJ Khaled, 2 Chainz, Lana Del Rey, Sia, J. Cole, and more. He is one of Drake's longest and most frequent collaborators, contributing to songs such as "HYFR", "The Motto", "Make Me Proud" (featuring Nicki Minaj) and "Blem".
He has garnered over 20 awards and nominations including Grammys, Platinum certifications, and BMI's Producer of the Year (earned on multiple occasions).


== Early life ==
T-Minus first started experimenting with music as a student at Pickering High School. "I’ve always loved music," he says. "I used to play the drums, so I’ve always been interested in music in that way." After sitting at the drum kit for a few years, he decided to try making his own rhythms, so he downloaded a digital audio workstation program called Fruity Loops when he was 15 years old and was soon creating entire songs.


== Artistry ==
On his sound, T-Minus has said: "I'm just taking things to a new place as far as music goes. I don't want to go to the same route that I was going to before so far as how everything sounds, how everything sits in your ears... I'm going back to the roots of R&B, mid-'90s, from hearing a Timbaland record, an Aaliyah, something from Blackground Music, for example. When the music had so much emotion."


== Awards and nominations ==
He also won Top Producer at the 2012 BMI Urban Awards.
