== Early years ==
Bach was born in the Bahamas and was raised in Peterborough, Ontario. He is one of eight children. His brother Zac Bierk is an ice hockey player.His father, David Bierk (d. 2002), was a noted painter. He painted one of Skid Row's album covers and inside cover art on another band album, and an album cover for one of Bach's solo records, and inside art for another solo effort.Bach became confident of his ability to sing partly from listening to his mother and aunt sing informally at home and feeling joyful when he heard them.He also joined a church choir when he was eight years old, and found much joy in singing "Gloria in Excelsis Deo" with them. He knew while singing the hymn that he would sing for the rest of his life.


== Career ==


=== Kid Wikkid (1983–1985) ===
The members of Kid Wikkid were based in Peterborough, Ontario. Upon hearing of the band and unaware of their ages, 14-year-old Bach auditioned for the group, and was hired by guitar player and band leader Jason Delorme. Kid Wikkid moved back to Toronto, and Bach's dad eventually allowed Bach to move in with an aunt.


=== Skid Row (1987–1996) ===
Skid Row initially formed in the mid-1980s with lead vocalist Matt Fallon fronting the group, and they began playing at various clubs around the New Jersey area. Fallon left the band in 1987, leaving Skid Row in search of a lead vocalist. Bach was spotted singing at rock photographer Mark Weiss's wedding by Jon Bon Jovi's parents, who subsequently approached him and suggested he get in touch with their son's friend, Dave Sabo, who was looking for a lead vocalist for his band. Bach was wary of joining another US-based band after briefly being a member of Detroit's Madam X. Upon hearing Skid Row's demo tapes, however, Bach flew to New Jersey to audition and became the up-and-coming band's lead vocalist in early 1987.

Skid Row achieved commercial success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with its first two albums Skid Row (1989) and Slave to the Grind (1991) certified multi-platinum, the latter of which reached number one on the Billboard 200. The band's third album Subhuman Race (1995) was also critically acclaimed.
In 1991, Bach was criticized for performing wearing a T-shirt reading "AIDS Kills Fags Dead". Later he claimed he wore it without reading it first; it had been thrown to him by a fan.In 1993, Bach shortly toured with Triumph after the release of their album Edge of Excess, providing lead vocals up until the band broke up later the same year. Following disagreements over musical material and infuriating Bolan, Bach was fired from the band in 1996. However, rumors circulated that he had left the band due to his other band-mates believing they should not play as an opening act for Kiss. Band-mate Rachel Bolan also had a side project, a punk band Prunella Scales who were playing at the same time as the planned Kiss show. The rift between Bach and the other band members subsequently led to his leaving Skid Row. Four years later, Skid Row was one of the opening acts for the 2000 Kiss Farewell Tour, without Bach.

In 1996, Bach formed The Last Hard Men, with Frogs guitarist Jimmy Flemion, Breeders lead guitarist brought in to play bass Kelley Deal, and Smashing Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin.

In 1998 it was released on Kelley Deal's label, Nice Records, with no fanfare and a very limited pressing of 1,000 CDs. This run may have been sold via mail order only.In 1999, Bach released his debut solo album Bring 'Em Bach Alive!, his first release after his departure from Skid Row.
