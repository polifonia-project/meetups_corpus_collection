== Reviews ==
'Zeniodi coolly rose to the occasion, drawing stupendous playing from the students of the university's Frost Symphony Orchestra.... Zeniodi drew maximum tension from the opening sequences, bringing the quiet dreamlike section to a great climax. In Shostakovich's Ballet Suite No.1, Zeniodi drew some of the best playing the orchestra has ever produced. Ensemble playing was knife-edge precise.'
