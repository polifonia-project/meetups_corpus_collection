Dragi Šestić (born 14 May 1966) is a Bosnian music producer, sound engineer, director of music video clips and record label owner.
In 1998 he founded the first Bosnian World Music band, Mostar Sevdah Reunion. He rediscovered almost forgotten Gypsy music legends from ex-Yugoslavia Šaban Bajramović and Ljiljana Buttler-Petrović and brought them into the spotlight of the international World Music scene.
Šestić was born in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He worked with the famous maqaam (Maqam al-iraqi), star and only female master of it - Farida Ali from Iraq on her album Ishraqaat.
His work involved many of the Balkan stars, including the Queen of Gyspies Esma Redžepova, Boban Marković, Naat Veliov, Amira Medunjanin, Fulgerica, Ljubiša Stojanović Louis, and many more. His work can be found on many World Music compilations, but most of it is on his record label Snail Records, founded in 2002. He lives and works in the Netherlands.
