== Early life ==
Yanagi was born in Osaka Prefecture on May 31, 1987. From an early age, she had become interested in music, playing with an electronic keyboard her neighbor originally intended to throw away. She also sang to nursery rhymes, making up tunes as she saw fit. When she was in junior high school, her brother bought computer programs used for producing music, which she decided to experiment on. During her junior high school years, because of her belief that "her voice was mediocre", she decided to make music instead.

== Artistry ==


=== Influences ===
Yanagi cites Akino Arai, Yoko Kanno, and Maaya Sakamoto as well as the 1996 song "Flower Crown" by the musical unit Goddess in the Morning as some of her musical influences; early on, she decided that she wanted to write music "just like Arai". In an interview with Japanese website Natalie, she describes how desktop music software was magical for her, as it allowed her to make music without playing instruments. She later bought an audio interface for the software to allow her to experiment more.


=== Musical style ===
In an interview with Animate Times, Yanagi discussed her experiences in making the single "Ambivalentidea", as well as her early career. She describes how she originally did not intend to pursue a career in music, as producing dōjin music was just a hobby and she was working at a non-music related job. She started out performing covers of songs, but due to positive reception online, she was persuaded to make original songs as well. For the single "Ambivalentidea", she wanted to incorporate Jormungand's theme of "contradiction" in the song. To accomplish this, she included figurative and abstract words in the song's lyrics. The song's title comes from the words ambivalent and idea, which when put together were intended to express the idea of a contradiction of visualization. In an interview with Natalie, she described how because she wanted the song to have a "more literary feel", she would frequently consult a dictionary while writing the lyrics.In an interview with Entertainment Station, Yanagi discussed her role as music producer of the anime series Just Because!, and the making of the series' opening theme "Over and Over". It was the first time that she served as a music producer for an anime series, so she would discuss ideas with anime staff. As Just Because! is set in a high school, she set out to write music that would fit scenes, deciding when instruments such as the piano or guitar would be used depending on the scene. She used picture stories as references in making the soundtrack; she also used high school baseball cheering songs as references in writing a track for scenes involving baseball. The intro of "Over and Over" was influenced by two of her earlier songs "Yukitoki" and "Harumodoki", which were both used in My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong, As I Expected. For the song, she wanted to incorporate the series plot point of transferring schools; she aimed for the song to have a happy feeling, but she took time finding a way to express it.
