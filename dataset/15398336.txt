== Biography ==
Mack attended Belmont University, and signed a publishing deal with Famous Music after graduating. In 2004, Mack released his first album, Average Guy. He had a hand in writing every song on the project. The first single, "We Can't All Be From Texas," reached the top 10 on the Texas Music Chart and was used by George W. Bush during his 2004 election campaign. It was also played in the stadium during the stadium of the 2004 college football game between Oklahoma Sooners and the University of Texas Longorns (the Red River Shootout.)
When Canadian artists such as George Canyon, Adam Gregory and Brad Johner began recording Mack's songs, he started making trips to Canada and writing with Canadian songwriters. One of those songwriters was Jason McCoy, who would become the co-producer of Mack's second album and the co-writer of its first single, "Gonna Get Me a Cadillac." The album, Headlights & Tailpipes, was recorded in Toronto, Nashville and Texas. It was released in July 2007 in Canada on Open Road Recordings. Once again, Mack wrote or co-wrote all twelve tracks. The album's second single, "Don't Waste Your Pretty," peaked at No. 94 on the all-genre Canadian Hot 100. Mack released his third album, The Journey, in 2009.
In 2012, Mack formed the group Friday Night Satellites.
