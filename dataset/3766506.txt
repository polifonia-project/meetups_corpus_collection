Stuart Langelaan (born 4 June 1974), stage name Lange, is a British DJ and record producer.


== Career ==
Lange was born in Shrewsbury. His career began in 1997, signing his first recording contract with Additive Records in the UK. Early popularity was achieved with a collection of releases attracting the attention of industry leaders such as Paul van Dyk, Sasha, Paul Oakenfold and Judge Jules.
A mixture of slow build-ups and melodic choruses gave Lange several hits in the UK Singles Chart. His first success was his remix of DJ Sakin's "Protect Your Mind", which became a club track. This was followed by his Lost Witness "Happiness Happening" remix. Other remix credits include work for Faithless and The Pet Shop Boys (the Lange remix of "New York City Boy" featured on their PopArt album's bonus "remix disc").
In 1999, he released the vinyl-only single "I Believe" featuring vocals by Sarah Dwyer charting at No. 68. A year later, in 2000, he released the single "Follow Me" on Positiva, featuring the vocals of Cecily Fay from The Morrighan. Upon its release, the track was deemed chart ineligible as the CD single contained six tracks (including the previous release "I Believe") and over 40 minutes of music (at the time, chart rules stated that CD singles could only contain three tracks with a total running length of 20 minutes). Thus the single reached No. 1 on the UK budget album chart upon release, staying in the chart for four weeks. "I Believe" and "Follow Me" were re-released as part of Positiva Records 10th birthday celebrations in 2003, reaching No. 12 in the UK budget album chart.
"Drifting Away" reached No. 9 in the UK Singles Chart in 2002, and resulted in Lange performing on the BBC One's Top of the Pops and also the Pepsi Chart Show. Lange was also behind the SuReaL track "You Take My Breath Away", which peaked at No. 15 in the UK in 2000.Lange mixes have accumulated many appearances on compilation albums, including two tracks on the million-selling EMI Now That's What I Call Music! series. Other more club-orientated projects include his 'Firewall', 'LNG', and 'Vercetti' guises. In 2003, Firewall's "Sincere" was released on Armin Van Buuren's A State of Trance record label, and was re-released on Lange's own label, Lange Recordings. His 2003 track, "Don't Think It (Feel It)" (featuring Leah) peaked at No. 59 in the UK Singles Chart. In 2005, Lange went down the commercial road again with the release of the vocal track "If I ever see you again", under the name of Offbeat, however this only made number 136 in the UK Charts, probably due to it being a 12" release only despite the apparent mainstream appeal of the track.
Lange has found similar success as a club DJ, reaching No. 37 in the DJ Mag poll. As well as playing some of the UK's biggest clubs (including Godskitchen, Gatecrasher, Passion, Gallery, and Slinky), Lange regularly tours internationally. Touring has taken him to Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, China, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Ibiza, Canada and the United States. Lange has headlined music festivals including Australia's Summadayze (alongside Tiësto), the Popsicle festival in San Francisco, Spooky and WEMF in Canada, and Fortdance in St Petersburg performing alongside Ferry Corsten and Tiësto.
He released his debut album Better Late Than Never on Maelstrom and Lange Recordings in 2007. The album had one CD of new material, and a second disc called History that highlighted some of his past hits from 1998 to the present. Three singles from the album had successful releases; those were "Songless", "Angel Falls" and the most successful release, "Lange feat. Sarah Howells – Out of the Sky". That release retained a top 10 position on the Beatport Trance Chart for a considerable time after the track's release in October 2008, and earned Lange the nomination as one of the Beatport Top 10 selling Trance Artists in 2008.
In 2010, he released his second album, Harmonic Motion. In 2013, his third album "We Are Lucky People" was released.
