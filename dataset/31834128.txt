Kris Moyes (born 30 October 1978) is an Australian-born director and producer and founder of KMOYES PICTURES. He is perhaps best known for his innovative music videos.
In 2005 he directed The Presets "Are You The One?" which utilized a large array of film techniques that playfully proposed answers to who the "one" is. The video also featured a digital artifact motif he developed by interrupting the transfer of DIVX files of original footage from a PC to a MAC computer, to which many homage videos were made.Moyes has had close ties to Modular Records since 2005. He is probably better known for his videos for Softlightes and The Presets. In 2008 Moyes directed a traditional performance based music video for Wolfmother "White Unicorn" on the condition that Pav, the head of Modular Records allowed him to deface his own work and re-release it, under the pseudonym Banditobruce. The piece of subterfuge was a reference to Marcel Duchamp's Readymade, L.H.O.O.Q.
Moyes has also directed four music videos for Sia Furler. His first video for Sia's "Buttons" in 2007 was linked by Perez Hilton on his blog and received over 300,000 views in one day, becoming the No.1 Most Linked Music Video and No.2 Most Viewed Music Video on YouTube.In 2010 Moyes directed and co-wrote a satirical short film, called "City Limits" featuring costumes by Australian fashion label, Romance Was Born.  It was screened at ASVOFF (A Shaded View on Fashion Film) at the Centre Pompidou, Paris.
Moyes has also been exhibited alongside John Baldessari, Brian Bress, Miranda July, Peter Sutherland, Paper Rad, Melanie Bonajo, Michael Gondry, Spike Jonze, Chris Cunningham, Mark Romanek and Floria Sigmondi.Over the years, Moyes has appeared in a number of publications including, L.A. Times, Esquire, Tokion, The Open Day Book and The New York Times where he was invited alongside Jeff Koons, Banks Violette, Oscar de la Renta and The Campana Brothers to re-design the ' T ' Logo for The New York Times Style Magazine.Between 2015-2018, Moyes redesigned the identity for Australia's longest running TV program RAGE, the first redesign in over 30 years.
