== Podcast ==
In August 2006, Kashian began hosting a podcast, Dork Forest Radio, later The Dork Forest, with new episodes being released once or twice a week. Initially on the BlogTalkRadio network and co-hosted by comedian Joe Wilson, it was for several years transmitted live from her house in Van Nuys and, after leaving BlogTalkRadio, pre-recorded in her living room for transmission.  The show features "dork on dork dialog" between Kashian and her guests about their favorite obsessionsâ€”commonly referred to by Kashian as 'dorkdoms'.  Guests have included Paul F. Tompkins, Jen Kirkman, James Urbaniak, Jimmy Pardo, Aisha Tyler, and Mary-Lynn Rajskub. Fans of the show refer to themselves as "Rangers Of The Dork Forest". In 2010, the podcast changed from a live format to pre-recorded, with superior audio quality and a new theme song, "Welcome to The Dork Forest", written by Mike Ruekberg. In 2011, Kashian recorded her first Dork Forest with a club or theater audience attending, with subsequent "live" episodes including those posted on August 12, 2016 and September 7, 2016.
In early 2016, Kashian and fellow comic Laurie Kilmartin began a new podcast produced by Nerdist Industries called "The Jackie and Laurie Show". The podcast later became independent and moved to the Maximum Fun network. The two primarily discuss stand-up comedy in LA and on the road, occasionally covering harassment and the unequal treatment of female comics, Kilmartin's job as a staff writer on the late-night circuit, and Kilmartin's multi-generational family living situation.
