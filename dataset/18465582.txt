== Life and career ==
His early experience in drumming came from his father, who is also a drummer. Harris would play along to Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Emerson, Lake & Palmer and The Police, and has reached his current level of proficiency without any lessons or formal training. Melvins and Neurosis are also direct influences on his and Isis' sound. He cites Bill Bruford as an influence on his later material, having been introduced to his work through Danny Carey.Harris' first band was named Loga, which he joined whilst in high school. He was given a cassette of Melvins by the band members and asked to emulate the style of their drummer, Dale Crover. His material, he says, “changed [Harris'] life [...] it really shaped me into a whole new drummer.”In October 2006 Harris began endorsing Paiste cymbals. In 2009, Harris also signed an endorsement deal with Sonor drums. He is also sponsored by Evans Drumheads and Vater. Harris is endorsed by Vater drumsticks, and Heil microphones.
In April 2012 it was announced that Harris had joined Chino Moreno of Deftones, along with former bandmates Jeff Caxide and Clifford Meyer, in a side project by the name of Palms. Their first album was originally slated for release in 2012 on Ipecac Records,. It was released on June 25, 2013.
Following his time in Isis and Palms, Harris began composing music for films, television shows and trailers. At Methodic Doubt Music, he has worked on the custom score or sound design for such titles as Jessica Jones, Us, Hereditary and True Detective. In February 2019, Harris released his debut solo album titled Dark Energy through Methodic Doubt. The album is intended to be used in films and trailers and was self-described as a "collection of tracks and sound design ideal for horror, thriller and suspense."
