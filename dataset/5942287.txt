== Adolescents (1980–81, 1986–89, 2001–2018) ==
Adolescents were formed in Fullerton, California in 1980 and were one of main punk acts to emerge from Orange County, along with their peers in Agent Orange and Social Distortion. The band's debut album, 1981's Adolescents (also known as the blue album) was one of the first hardcore punk records to be widely distributed throughout the United States, and became one of the best-selling California hardcore albums behind the Dead Kennedys' 1980 album, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables, selling over 10,000 copies. Following the release of their 1981 E.P. Welcome to Reality the band broke up. In 1986, the original Adolescents line-up reunited to perform a concert at Fenders Ballroom in Long Beach, California. The Concert was a major success with fans and critics alike, which lead to the reformation of the original group. Line-up changes including lead singer Tony Brandenburg leaving to join the Flower Leperds (A.K.A. Tony Cadena, Tony Reflex) caused Rikk Agnew to share vocal duties with Soto. In 1988 Soto was the main vocalist in the band. In 1989 The Adolescents broke up for a second time. In 2001, the blue album lineup of Adolescents reformed to perform at a birthday party for singer Tony Reflex's wife and over the next few years the band played sporadically. Encouraged by the response to their reunion shows, Reflex suggested that the band start writing new material. The Adolescents issued an EP titled Unwrap and Blow Me! in 2003, limited to 100 copies and consisting of six new songs.  The band performed a show on October 3, 2003 at the House of Blues at Downtown Disney, which was filmed and recorded for Kung Fu Records' live series The Show Must Go Off!. The resulting live album and DVD, titled Live at the House of Blues, was released February 24, 2004. The following year the band released The Complete Demos 1980–1986 which collected all the demo recordings from the Adolescents' early years. Following the departure of Rikk Agnew, The Adolescents decided to continue as a quartet, re-recording the new songs they had done with Rikk and recording several more for their 2005 comeback album, OC Confidential, which ultimately took over two years to complete. Founding guitarist Frank Agnew left the band in 2006  leaving Soto and Reflex as the band's sole constant members and primary songwriters from this point forward.
