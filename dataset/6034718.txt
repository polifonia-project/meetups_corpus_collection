Douglas Pipes is an American film score composer whose feature films include the Academy Award-nominated Monster House and the horror film Trick 'r Treat. His brassy instrumentations have drawn comparisons to action-music composer guru Alan Silvestri and his other orchestral-music composer counterparts Michael Giacchino, J.A.C. Redford and Joel McNeely. His chance encounter with Gil Kenan at UCLA California made him the perfect composer for this soundtrack and composed the music on his short film The Lark.
Awards include International Film Music Critics Association "Best Original Score for a Comedy Film 2015" for the Horror/Comedy Krampus, "Compositor Revalacion" for Monster House at the 3rd International Film Music Conference in Ubeda, Spain and "Best Animation” at the Royal Television Society in the United Kingdom.  Nominations include “Discovery of the Year" for Monster House at the 2006 World Soundtrack Awards in Ghent, Belgium, "Best Music" at the 2007 Saturn Awards, "Best Horror Score" 2009 for Trick 'r Treat 2009 and "Best New Composer" 2006 for Monster House from the International Film Music Critics Association.
Soundtrack CDs are available from LaLaLand Records and vinyl from Waxwork Records.
Pipes also works with the rock band The Airborne Toxic Event, providing arrangements and orchestrations for symphony concerts across the U.S.
Pipes has been commissioned twice by the Dallas Chamber Symphony a to compose original scores for their silent film series. In 2014 for Alfred Hitchcock's silent film, The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog. The premiere was October 8, 2014.
