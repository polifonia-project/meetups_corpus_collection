== Compositions ==
Her only apparently surviving compositions are some songs, a tarantella in E minor and a sonata in A (the latter two works for piano). The last two have been republished by Vivace Press. Also surviving is a pair of articles in the 1862 Musical Times entitled A Few Words on Piano Playing. Composed but possibly lost also were at least one piano quartet and a cello sonata in addition to the concerto and trio.
