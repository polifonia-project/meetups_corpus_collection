== Biography ==
McCoy was born in Barrie, Ontario and was raised for a time in Camrose, Alberta before his family settled in Anten Mills, Ontario. At around the age of 5, his family moved to Camrose, Alberta, returning three years later. "The cowboy culture really stuck with me. I just fell in love with the music. For some reason, as a little kid, I had some sort of connection with these guys who were singing about these depressing things," McCoy said, citing Merle Haggard and Johnny Cash to lesser known artists like Ed Bruce and Wynn Stewart. "I just didn't have a voice for rock 'n' roll." Jason started playing guitar at age 7 and wrote his first song when he was 12.In his teens, McCoy owned a rock 'n' roll guitar and was partial to AC/DC. In the 1980s, he joined a band called Three Quarter Country, which performed at legion halls, Saturday night dances, and clubs in Barrie, Midland, Orillia and other small towns. McCoy won a talent contest in Barrie, Ontario where he was discovered by country music writer Henry McGuirk who later became his manager and arranged for him to travel to Nashville to record an album with producer Ray Griff. He later signed with MCA Records in 1995.
On May 1, 1999, McCoy married his longtime girlfriend Terrine Barnes. The couple have two children.
McCoy was a member of the country-rock group The Road Hammers from 2005 to 2010, which also featured musicians Clayton Bellamy and Chris Byrne, and earlier, Corbett Frasz. His first album in seven years, the live Christmas at the Grand, was released on November 2, 2010, while his first studio album in eight years, Everything, was released on March 1, 2011.
