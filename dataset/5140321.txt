He studied the accordion at The Norwegian Academy of Music in Oslo from 1994 and at the Royal Danish Conservatory of Music in Copenhagen, where he debuted with a concert in 2000.He was awarded the Young Soloist of the Year prize 2001 by the Norwegian Concert Institute at the Bergen International Festival 2000, as well as second prize in the prestigious International Gaudeamus Interpreters Competition in the Netherlands.

He also received the French Prix Gus Viseur in 2004 for the same album. His next album Passing images (2007) featured his own interpretations of Norwegian folk. He was joined by Arve Henriksen, Garth Knox and Maja Ratkje on this album.Frode currently (2015) lives in Svartskog, close to Oslo but frequently tours abroad, in Europe, Russia, America and Asia. He has performed as a soloist with major orchestras around the world and is actively working with chamber music—the trio POING taking up much of his time currently.
