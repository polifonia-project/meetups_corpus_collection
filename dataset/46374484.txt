== Early life ==
Monét was born in Georgia and moved to Sacramento, California, as a child. Her mother is L'Tanya Chestang-Cubit (née Lovett) and her maternal grandmother was Cassaundria Lovett of Mobile, Alabama. She has a half-brother named Michael Cubit, Jr. In Catholic elementary school, she appeared on stage in holiday plays, and in church she sang in the youth choir. In junior high school she formed her own dance group; this led to teaching at two dance studios. She attended Sheldon High School in Sacramento after pleading with her mother to change their address so that she could participate in Sheldon's performing arts program.


== Career ==


=== 2010–2015: Songwriting and Nightmares & Lullabies ===
Outside of dance rehearsals, Monét began exchanging poetry with an older cousin and found a new passion. This soon translated into her writing her own music. Meanwhile, she had been educating herself on the production world, learning about producers, and making music at a local recording studio. She learned about Rodney Jerkins (aka Darkchild) and decided to add him on Myspace. Shortly after that, he invited her to come to Los Angeles and audition for a new girl group he was forming, Purple Reign. The group landed a record deal with Motown a year later, but was dropped before releasing any music. After the group's disbandment, Monet turned to songwriting to earn money while she waited for her own music career to build up. The first song she worked on was a track for Diddy Dirty Money's 2010 album, Last Train to Paris. She continued to write song hooks and sang the demos herself before sending them out. Her hope was that the labels would like her version enough that they would keep her on the track as a feature.Atlantic Records CEO Craig Kallman heard one of her demos in a meeting and offered her a record deal later that day. Even though she was signed, Monet acknowledged that her songwriting "took off" before her music, while she was working on both. Her songwriting remained her main form of income during the beginning of her music career. On October 30, 2014, Monet released her debut EP Nightmares & Lullabies: Act 1 and on June 17, 2015, she released her follow-up EP Nightmares & Lullabies – Act 2 under Atlantic Records. Monet chose the name as it represented the sound of the EPs: a dark beat mixed with soft melodies.
