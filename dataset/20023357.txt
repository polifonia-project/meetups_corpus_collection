=== Lifehouse ===
While Woolstenhulme was in a music studio session, Lifehouse, then comprising Jason Wade and Sergio Andrade, was practicing in the adjacent room. Woolstenhulme, then playing with another band, bumped into them in the hallway. It was suggested that he check out Lifehouse, which was looking for a drummer to replace Jon "Diff" Palmer; in 2000, he joined the band.
Woolstenhulme has since performed on each Lifehouse recording.

Beginning in 2013, Woolstenhulme toured with the Goo Goo Dolls following the departure of Mike Malinin.

He expressed a preference for Gretsch drums due to a better-quality sound.  He currently uses a DW drum kit with Zildjian cymbals, a brand he has used consistently through his career.
