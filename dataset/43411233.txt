Her father operated his own civil engineering and construction company called Sasagawa Group Co., Ltd. So, Miwa was in fact the daughter of a company president. Incidentally, the company produced an original Japanese hand towel in collaboration with the release of the song, "Utsukushii Kage" (「美しい影」).
"Warai" (「笑」), which could be called her seminal hit, was written for her cousin.
She was pen pals with Masayuki Kishima, the mayor of Shiunji, since before her major label debut.
She was the host of All Night Nippon when the 2004 Chūetsu earthquake occurred. Since Miwa herself lives in Niigata, she received a lot of e-mails and postcards of encouragement from listeners. She was quite moved and, in spite of herself, actually cried during the show. Fortunately, the earthquake was relatively weak in her home area of Shiunji and it received almost no damage. However, she did say during the show that she was forced to travel by air due to the Joetsu Shinkansen being impassable.
She made a guest appearance at INORAN's Tour Final 2007 (Part One) on October 6, 2007 at Nakano Sun Plaza. She sang 3 songs from INORAN's first album "Sou" (「想」) and her own song "Koorizatou" (「氷砂糖」), which was produced by INORAN and H.Hayama, as well as two unreleased songs.
On December 29, 2008 she appeared at INORAN's Connectivity live show at Shibuya's duo MUSIC EXCHANGE live venue. She sang "Resolution", "Monsoon Baby," "Koorizatou" (「氷砂糖」), and "Machiumare, Inakaumare" (「街生まれ、田舎生まれ」).
As the lone host of All Night Nippon, she would often suddenly begin speaking in an angry sounding tone as if she had lost her temper. Even her tagline in the show's commercial was her angrily saying, "Do I sound mad?!"
She appeared again as the host of All Night Nippon on August 25, 2012, about 6 years and 5 months since her last appearance. During the show she talked about her father's company no longer existing and said that she was no longer the daughter of a company president.
