== Career ==
Rateliff was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on October 7, 1978. He grew up in rural Missouri, learning to play the drums at age seven. As a teenager he taught himself guitar, began writing songs and, at eighteen, moved to Denver.


=== 2002–2008: Born in the Flood ===
In 2002, Rateliff formed Born in the Flood, quickly garnering a large following in Denver and headlining local festivals like the Westword Music Showcase. In February 2007, Born in the Flood released their first full-length album If This Thing Should Spill. Despite increasing success with Born in the Flood, Rateliff turned down an offer from Roadrunner Records, and shifted his focus to a more stripped-down, solo effort, playing somber, singer-songwriter content under his name and "Nathaniel Rateliff and the Wheel".

In 2007, while still performing with Born in the Flood, Rateliff began recording and performing more personal, somber content both solo and with BitF bandmate and lifetime collaborator Joseph Pope III (bass/guitar/vibes/organ/harmonica). The project expanded with more live performances, adding Julie Davis (upright bass/vocals), Carrie Beeder (organ/violin), James Han (keys/vibes), and Ben Desoto (drums/flute). Shortly after the breakup of Born in the Flood, Rateliff released Desire and Dissolving Men on Public Service Records. Nathaniel Rateliff then released In Memory of Loss in the USA on Rounder Records in May 2010, and then in the UK on Decca in March 2011. In Memory of Loss was recorded with producer Brian Deck (Iron & Wine). On September 17, 2013, Rateliff released Falling Faster Than You Can Run on Mod y Vi Records. On the same day he set out on a tour with The Lumineers and Dr. Dog, in support of the album.


=== 2013–present: Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats ===

Beginning in 2013, while still performing and recording with earlier solo and group projects, Rateliff embarked on a more upbeat, soulful sound with longtime collaborator Joseph Pope III and other collaborators in shows around Denver and Boulder. On June 24, 2015, the self-titled release of Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats via Stax Records was announced with the lead single being "S.O.B.". The Night Sweats feature Joseph Pope III (bass), Mark Shusterman (keyboards) and Patrick Meese (drums). Other band members include Luke Mossman (guitar), Wesley Watkins (trumpet), and Andy Wild (saxophone). According to the Los Angeles Times, this was "an album Rateliff made as a last-ditch effort before throwing in the towel on his music career, only to see it go viral and turn into a runaway hit."In November 2016, he released the 8-track EP A Little More From...
Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats released a new album titled Tearing at the Seams on March 9, 2018. After spending a week recording 18 songs with his band, Rateliff was not content and decided to return to the studio for five days with his band's rhythm section and three more days with the horns section, producing seven to eight new songs he felt were "appropriate, the right tempo and the right mood". The band shared the record's lead single "You Worry Me". Produced by Richard Swift and being offered in 12-track standard and 14-track deluxe editions, the band assembled in Rodeo, New Mexico for the initial writing and recording sessions for the album.
"You Worry Me" is built on an insistent, swaggering pulse, and powered by echo-heavy guitars and throbbing bass and drums, with horns joining midway through as Rateliff sings a message of support and encouragement to someone who appears to be losing faith.

In February 2018, "You Worry Me", the lead single from Tearing at the Seams, their second studio album, hit number one on the Adult Alternative Songs charts. It would later hit the top 10 on the Alternative Songs chart in June 2018. Tearing at the Seams was released on March 9, 2018. The album debuted at number 11 on the Billboard 200 for the week of March 24, 2018, and debuted on the Alternative Albums chart at number 5.
