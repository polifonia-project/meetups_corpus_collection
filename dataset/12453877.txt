Matt Miller is a native of El Paso, Texas and the bassist for the Post-hardcore band, Sparta. He currently resides in Los Angeles, California.


== Sparta ==
Matt Miller joined vocalist Jim Ward, drummer Tony Hajjar, and guitarist Paul Hinojos in Sparta a few months after its conception when original bassist Erick Sanger was let go from the group, and Miller's previous band Belknap broke up. The fact that Sparta was starting so soon after the break-up of his bandmates previous effort, At the Drive-In, did not faze Miller, though he knew the band would have a rough start. For the band's first record, Wiretap Scars, all members contributed lyrics, and Miller was no exception. Though Sparta's frontman Ward now takes on lyrical duties by himself; Miller has expanded his role in the group, now providing back-up vocals along with guitarist Keeley Davis (Hinojos has since left the group). Also, some songs on their latest album, Threes, are noticeably more bass orientated. The first single of the album, "Taking Back Control", opens with a bass heavy groove, and is Sparta's most successful single to date, reaching 24 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock charts. Miller refers to Threes as more positive than the previous records, and describes the addition of Davis as a breath of fresh air.
