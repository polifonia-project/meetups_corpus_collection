Wendy Ann Melvoin (born January 26, 1964) is an American guitarist and singer-songwriter, best known for her work with Prince as part of his backing band The Revolution, and for her collaboration with Lisa Coleman as one half of the duo Wendy & Lisa.


== Music career ==
Wendy Melvoin met Prince in 1980 when her girlfriend Lisa Coleman joined Prince's band for the Dirty Mind period. Prince would stay at their house when he came to the L.A. area and she was regularly at the Dirty Mind, Controversy, and 1999 tour shows. She was watching from backstage when Prince and the band opened for the Rolling Stones in 1981. One night when she was practicing guitar in Lisa Coleman's room, Prince overheard and asked Coleman who was playing guitar. A few days later, when guitarist Dez Dickerson didn't show up at soundcheck, Prince asked Melvoin to play his guitar; that same night, Prince invited her to join the band. Melvoin sang back up on the 1999 album song "Free", as well as the B-side single "Irresistible Bitch." Melvoin's debut show with The Revolution was a benefit concert for the Minnesota Dance Theatre at the First Avenue nightclub in Minneapolis on August 3, 1983. This concert was recorded and some of the songs ("Let's Go Crazy," "Computer Blue," "Purple Rain," "Baby I'm a Star," and "I Would Die 4 U") were released on Purple Rain, Prince's next record. Melvoin was 19 at that time.
Melvoin then worked extensively with Prince in the studio on songs released and unreleased, as well as contributing to protégé projects such as 1984's Apollonia 6, 1985's The Family, and the 1985 Prince & the Revolution album Around the World in a Day.
Shortly after the completion of Prince and The Revolution's 1986 album tour in October 1986 Parade, Coleman and Melvoin left the Revolution and started their own duo, Wendy & Lisa, also known as Girl Brothers.
Melvoin performed with Prince at a Bangles show later in 1986 and appears on Prince's 1987 album Sign o' the Times on the tracks "Slow Love," "Strange Relationship," and "It's Gonna Be a Beautiful Night."
Melvoin and Coleman also composed music for the first season of the TV series Heroes. In September 2008, they announced that they would release an album consisting entirely of the score from Heroes, entitled Heroes: Original Score. Melvoin and Coleman composed the main title song for Nurse Jackie, for which they were awarded an Emmy in 2010. As of mid-November 2015, the duo was working on the American TV series Touch.
Melvoin and Coleman performed with Prince on and off during the 2004–2007 period: notably, the 2004 Tavis Smiley show performing "Reflections" with Prince; a June 5, 2004, Musicology tour aftershow; the 2006 Brit Award Show; and the 2007 Triple Hit shows in Minneapolis (the Macey's Show, the Target show, and the First Avenue show.) They also worked on a few songs on Prince's Planet Earth album.
Melvoin also contributed guitars to Madonna's 2008 album Hard Candy on the song "She's Not Me." She is mentioned by name during the song.
Melvoin contributed heavily to Neil Finn's second solo album One Nil, co-writing many tracks and playing drums and bass on several. She is credited for guitar work on most of the tracks on Rob Thomas's first solo album, ...Something to Be.
Melvoin is also listed in the credits of Glen Campbell's 2011 final studio album, Ghost on the Canvas.
