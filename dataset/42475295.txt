He was born in Leopoldville, now Kinshasa, DRC, in 1951. During his youth, he was an admirer of Rochereau's singing voice. Gerry Dialungana taught himself guitar by mimicking Docteur Nico.

In 1973 he joined Les Grand Maquisards, where Dalienst was a member.  In 1976, he joined TPOK Jazz, where he became a member of the band's directional committee.
