Matthew Jones (born 1974) is a British violist, violinist and composer primarily known for his international performance work as a soloist, recitalist and chamber musician. He also holds a Viola Professorship and is Head of Chamber Music at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and runs an in-demand performance health consultancy practice. He is fluent in Italian.


== Biography ==
Jones was born in Swansea, Wales, and began studying violin at the age of five. After graduating with a first class degree in mathematics from the University of Warwick, he studied violin at the Royal College of Music in London and viola privately with violist Rivka Golani.


== Performing career ==
Hailed by The Strad magazine as "a worthy successor to Lionel Tertis" and winner of the prize for the most promising British entrant at the 2003 Lionel Tertis International Viola Competition, Jones is violist of the Bridge Duo (viola and piano), the Debussy Ensemble (flute, viola and harp) and violinist with Ensemble MidtVest (an innovative ten-piece ensemble based in Denmark). He can frequently be seen performing in major international concert venues such as the Royal Festival Hall, the Royal Albert Hall and Wigmore Hall in London, Forbidden City Concert Hall in Beijing and Carnegie Hall where he made his critically acclaimed US recital debut in 2008.
Jones has commissioned numerous works and given many world and European premieres, and champions neglected viola works through recitals and recordings. He is in demand as a concerto soloist, performing with such orchestras as the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra.
Jones was the only British-based violist to be invited to perform at the 2010 International Viola Congress in Cincinnati, and was also a member of the Badke String Quartet when they won the 2007 Melbourne International Chamber Music Competition.


== Pedagogy ==
Jones is Professor of Viola and in August 2017 was appointed Head of Chamber Music at Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He has given masterclasses in the US at institutions such as Indiana University and Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, and in Malaysia, Australia, Japan and throughout Europe and the UK.
Jones was the inaugural recipient of the RWCMD's William Walton Fellowship. In addition he is passionate about musical education for younger students through his work with Pro Corda and Aldeburgh Young Musicians.


== Performance wellness ==
Inspired by his recovery from a career-threatening repetitive strain injury at the age of 23, Jones developed a keen interest in performers' well-being and trained as a teacher of the Alexander Technique, Kundalini Yoga and Performance Wellness. Jones now works worldwide as a consultant to musicians on enhancing performance using these and other methods. His students of the Alexander Technique have included world-renowned conductors and soloists, world champion athletes and several orchestras including the European Union Youth Orchestra. He has presented workshops and seminars on healthy practice for musicians and techniques for enhancing performance at conservatoires in the UK, Europe and the US.
