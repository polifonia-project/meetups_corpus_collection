== Musical career ==


=== Rise to fame ===
The Dogg used to perform at school concerts in his high-school years. When he was in grade nine, he and long-time friend Joe Basson, now known as Auntie Sousa, created a kwaito dancing group called Amasilkies. Before pursuing a career in music, he was a backup artist, a dancer and he also opened shows for his famous cousin Killa B and well-known friend Jossy Joss. Morocky also opened concerts for well known South African artists, including Mzekezeke, Malaika, Mafikizolo, Mandoza, Brown Dash, Brickz and Ishmael among others. He rose to fame following the release of his hit single "Jesus Otati", a kwaito-gospel song produced by Elvo in 2003.
"Jesus Otati" (meaning "Jesus is saying") opened doors for Morocky's career. The song was very popular and earned him comparison to South African kwaito star Mandoza due to the roughness in his voice, which was compared to that of Mandoza. His voice was also compared to American rapper DMX, who is also known as The Dog, from which Morocky possibly got his stage name. The success of "Jesus Otati" propelled The Dogg to win the award for Artist of the Year and Best Kwaito song at the 2003 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. He then in 2003 founded Mshasho Productions, which gained popularity in 2004 after his second album.


=== Early career ===
While struggling to compile his album, The Dogg met and befriended upcoming artist Gazza, who had just returned to Namibia from studies in South Africa. The two started recording together and with the help of Elvo they recorded "Ghetto Life", a song by Gazza. This song's credits would later bring tension between the two artists. The two later signed solo recording contracts with a kwaito label, RC-Ghetto Records. The Dogg immediately started working on his debut album, releasing the critical acclaimed hit "Perfecto Tromentos" later that year. Around the same time, The Dogg was featured by Gazza on his hit "Shidolodolo", which went on to be very popular and won an award for Best Collaboration at the 2004 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. Morocky's released his debut album Shimaliw' Osatana in February 2004 under RC-Ghetto. It became the first full-length kwaito album in his country and won the award for Best Selling album at the 2004 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. The album was primarily produced by Elvo, who by then became The Dogg and Gazza's mentor.
Later that year in December, Morocky released his second studio album, Take Out Yo Gun. The album was released on his label Mshasho Productions. The lead single from the album, "The Dogg Is Back", won awards for Best Kwaito song and Best Video at the 2005 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. Morocky would later win the Artist of the Year award for the third time in three years at the 2005 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. The Artist of the Year award raised eyebrows by other artist, who started discriminating against Sanlam-NBC's awarding system. This situation would later bring bad blood between The Dogg and music partner Gazza, whom critics claimed was robbed the award.
Morocky signed the first artist to his Mshasho label, Sunny Boy, whom he met while studying at University of Namibia. It later turned out that Sunny refused a recording offer from Gazza before signing with The Dogg. At a concert in Luderitz (2005) The Dogg and Gazza got involved in a rooted argument which would later turn sour, prohibiting the two to work together in future. The argument was driven by Sunny Boy's decision to sign with Mshasho, which Gazza claimed was a betrayal as he had plans for signing him to his Gazza Music Productions. After the news hit the media, fans started taking sides. A lot of other issues surfaced, including an argument surrounding the Sanlam-NBC Artist of Year award, which was unfairly awarded to The Dogg.
In May 2006 Morocky released his third album, Introducing TeeDee. The Dogg co-produced the entire album with Jay Malgas. 
 On the album The Dogg also introduced his label's artist (OmPuff, Sunny Boy, Tre and Nasti) who all appear on the album.
