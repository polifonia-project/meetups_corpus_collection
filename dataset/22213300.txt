Joshua Caleb Dibb (born January 6, 1978), also known by his moniker Deakin, is an American musician who co-founded the experimental pop band Animal Collective. He is the most infrequent member of the collective appearing on only six of the group's eleven studio albums. In 2016, he made his solo debut with the album Sleep Cycle. He also occasionally works as a carpenter during musical down time.


== Biography ==
Dibb was born on January 6, 1978, in Orange, California to Jessica B Mendlovitz and David C Dibb, who married in 1977. He began writing and recording music with childhood friend Noah Lennox (Panda Bear) in 1991.  While at The Park School of Baltimore, Josh met David Portner (Avey Tare) and Brian Weitz (Geologist) when they asked him to join their band, Automine.  Josh introduced Noah to Dave and Brian and over the next few years the four spent time playing music together and sharing tapes of music they made individually.After high school, Panda Bear and Deakin went to Boston, where Deakin attended Brandeis University.  Avey Tare and Geologist moved to New York City to attend NYU and Columbia University respectively.  After months of playing the band finally settled on the name "Animal Collective". After touring with the group from 2004 to the end of 2006 and recording two albums, Feels and Strawberry Jam, the Water Curses EP and the visual album ODDSAC he decided to take a break from the increasingly rigorous touring schedule. After not participating in the recording of the album Merriweather Post Pavilion, he rejoined the band live on April 10, 2011 in Petaluma, California after a three-year absence.

On January 1, 2010, he played his first solo show as Deakin at The Ottobar in Baltimore, MD where he grew up. In December 2009, Deakin raised $25,985 through the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform to travel to Mali to play at the music festival Festival au DÃ©sert outside of Tomboctou in January 2010 and to record an album in early 2010.  After playing the music festival, Deakin played five shows in Europe, including a few shows opening for Panda Bear.
On January 7, 2016, Dibb sent backers of his Kickstarter campaign an announcement that his long awaited solo album was complete. The album, titled Sleep Cycle, was released on Bandcamp on April 6, 2016. "Just Am" was the first track shared from the album, accompanied by a music video.
