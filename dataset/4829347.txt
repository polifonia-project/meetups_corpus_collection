== Music career ==
Hyper released his debut album “We Control” in 2005, where incorporated live instrumentation such as guitars and bass and fused it with his newer electronic sound.  The album led to a world tour, which included Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, Roskilde in Denmark and even Glastonbury in his native United Kingdom. In 2009, Hyper released the single "Pitch Bitch" with JHz on Kilowatt Recordings. The song was used on the trailer Warner Brothers Film The Losers. Also in 2009, Hyper released a remix of German electronic musician Pet's song "Cloud Nine".
In 2005, his music appeared in the video game Need for Speed Most Wanted and then again in the 2013 game Need for Speed Rivals. He also remixed The Sims 2's original score for the Nightlife expansion pack.
In 2006, he made a track for the video game MotorStorm entitled "Hot Rockin'", which seems to be a different take on his similar track "Replica". "Hot Rockin'" was made exclusively for MotorStorm and never officially released anywhere.
In 2008, his track "Replica" was featured in the video game Midnight Club: Los Angeles.
On 28 March 2011, Hyper released a new single, "The End", taken from his third album, The Panic, which itself was released in April 2011 via Distinctive Records.In 2013 Hyper released his best-selling album to date, Lies, where he experimented with the power of dynamic and strings elements. The album received worldwide acclaim from artists and bloggers alike. In 2014, Hyper released an orchestral re-interpretation of 8 tracks featured in Lies to create “Symphony of Lies” in collaboration with Chris White. In 2018, "Spoiler" from Lies was featured in the E3 trailer for the video game Cyberpunk 2077 from CD Projekt Red.  
Hyper's music has been featured in television shows such as Orange is the New Black and Leftovers. It was also featured in the advertising campaign for the movie, Blade Runner 2049. 
Hyper has a singular focus on producing and crafting high end, polished sound tracks encompassing full orchestral pieces featuring dramatic instrumentation and the latest in electronic crossover. Hyper's approach to music curation is to create the defining moment of inspired sound that enhances motion picture content thus translating that moment into a lasting consumer sensory memory.
