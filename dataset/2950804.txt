George Braith (born George Timothy Braithwaite on June 26, 1939) is a soul-jazz saxophonist from New York.

Braith is known for playing multiple horns at once, a technique pioneered by Roland Kirk. Braith is credited with the invention of the Braithophone, two different horns (straight alto and soprano) mended together by extensions, valves and connections.
Braith is featured in a mosaic in the 72nd street station of the Second Avenue Subway in the New York City Subway system.Of Braith's album Musart Thom Jurek at AllMusic wrote, "Musart is his masterpiece; it is one of the most diverse yet refined albums to come out of the '60s, and has few peers even today."
