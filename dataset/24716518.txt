Claudio Fasoli (born 29 November 1939)  is an Italian jazz - saxophonist (tenor and soprano saxophone) and composer of modern jazz.


== Music career ==
Born in Venice, he now lives in Milan, Italy. After a long apprenticeship and many sessions with various prominent musicians, he achieved popularity in the '70s playing with Perigeo Quintet, among whose other artists were Giovanni Tommaso and Franco D'Andrea. This group performed throughout Europe and also overseas, and with it Fasoli gained considerable experience both as soloist and composer.
In 2017, Claudio Fasoli's book "Inner sounds. In the orbit of jazz and free music", published by Agenzia X. The forewords are by philosopher Massimo Donà, musicologist Carlo Boccadoro, and Franco Caroni, president of Siena Jazz; the book also contains many other contributions, including those by Ashley Kahn, Stefano Zenni, and Flavio Caprera (in 2020 the second expanded and updated edition came out).
In 2018, a referendum held by the magazine "Musica Jazz" (n.806, January 2018) among music critics awarded Claudio Fasoli as Musician of the Year. 
In the film "Voices" (awarded in over twenty international festivals), director Alberto Nacci dedicates one of the portraits to Claudio Fasoli.
In 2018 the film Claudio Fasoli's Innersounds by Angelo Poli and Carlodavid Mauri is also released. Written by Angelo Poli and Marc Tibaldi. Directed by Angelo Poli. Music by Claudio Fasoli. The film is a journey into the creative processes of jazz musician Claudio Fasoli, a journey in stages, an intimate and unedited black and white portrait. Fasoli's voice reveals his thoughts as he speaks directly to each individual viewer and helps us to enter the evolution of the creative process, and its key concepts such as time, improvisation, silence, subtraction, risk, unpredictability. The film follows the entire process of creation of a new composition by Claudio Fasoli: idea, composition, sharing with the group, improvisation. The composition and the chords drawn on the piano, played with the sax, the musical arrangement with the Quintet in the rehearsal room, up to the live performance. The editing is marked by the absolute respect of Claudio's music, for this reason "Claudio Fasoli's Innersounds" as well as being a portrait of a great of jazz, aspires to be in itself a true jazz film. The film was awarded Best International Documentary at Västerås Film Festival 2018, Prisma International Film Festival, Parma Film Festival, and other international festivals, including: Short Sounds Film Festival, Bournemout; Doc'n Roll Film Festival, London; Sonic Scene Music Film Fest, Trani; The Summershort Filmfestival, Munich.
In January 2022, the historic magazine "Musica Jazz" awarded "Next" (Abeat records) as the best cd of 2021.
