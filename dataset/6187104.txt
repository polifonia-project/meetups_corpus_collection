Jenkins was arrested in March 2008 for assault and cocaine trafficking. Federal charges, as well as warrants in Georgia and Tennessee, ultimately led to his arrest in Butler County, Ohio. Contrary to these allegations, Jenkins claimed in a 2010 interview with hiphopbeef.com that his trust and involvement with the wrong people led to the consequence of imprisonment. He was released from prison in 2010, and remained on house arrest until late 2011.
