Inara Maryland George (born July 4, 1974) is an American singer-songwriter and musician, one half of The Bird and the Bee, a member of the band Merrick, with Bryony Atkinson, and a member of the trio The Living Sisters, with Eleni Mandell and Becky Stark.


== Early life ==
George was born in Towson, Maryland. She is the daughter of Lowell George, the late founder of the rock and roll group Little Feat, and Elizabeth George. Jackson Browne wrote the song "Of Missing Persons" for Inara George after the death of her father. She has three half brothers named Luke, Forrest and Jed, and her father died just before her fifth birthday.
George was involved with theatre at a young age, especially Shakespeare, in Topanga Canyon, a community in the Santa Monica mountains. She later relocated to Boston, Massachusetts to study acting in the classical theater tradition.


== Career ==
While visiting home one summer, George and several high-school friends launched a band named Lode. To their surprise, the bandmates landed a deal with Geffen Records and released the 1996 album Legs & Arms. Later, George joined Bryony Atkinson to form Merrick, an indie rock duo that released two albums before disbanding in 2002.
Three years later, George struck out on her own by issuing her solo debut All Rise on Everloving Records.  All Rise was produced by Michael Andrews (Donnie Darko, Freaks and Geeks) and featured musical contributions from Greg Kurstin. The two formed the Bird and the Bee and released a self-titled album in 2006, followed by several EPs. While preparing for the duo's second full-length release, George also found time to return to her own project, teaming up with veteran producer and family friend Van Dyke Parks for 2008's An Invitation.


== Personal life ==
George is married to director Jake Kasdan, with whom she has three children, son Otis and twins Beau and Lorelei.
