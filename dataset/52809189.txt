Homer Steinweiss is an American drummer, songwriter, chef, and composer and producer known as a prominent drummer in the New York soul revival scene. He is a founding member and drummer of groups including Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings, Lee Fields & The Expressions, El Michels Affair, and Dan Auerbach's The Arcs, among many others. A popular session musician as part of The Dap-Kings and in his own right, he is perhaps best known for his work with Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse, with whom he recorded the 2006 album Back to Black.


== Early life ==
Steinweiss was born into a musical family in New York City. His parents worked in the Jewelry business and were very supportive of his interest in music. He began playing music in the early 1990s after watching a conga player in the jazz band at his sister's Manhattan high school. When his conga teacher became unavailable he switched to drums. Steinweiss was initially interested in grunge but an early drum teacher, Matt Patuto, guided him to the music of James Brown and The Meters.
In 2001, Steinweiss entered college at SUNY Purchase to study philosophy, though he already had an active musical career.


== Career ==
Steinweiss' career took off when he was only 16 after The Mighty Imperials released their first record, Thunder Chicken. The Mighty Imperials included Steinweiss on drums, bassist Nick Movshon, multi-instrumentalist Leon Michels (later founder of Truth and Soul Records), and singer Joseph Henry.
The Mighty Imperials' raw funk and soul sounds morphed into many collaborations including Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings, El Michels Affair, Fabulous Three, Menahan Street Band and The Arcs and others. In 2006, British producer Mark Ronson heard Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings and asked the band to play a session with the then-unknown Amy Winehouse.  These sessions became her album Back to Black.
Steinweiss has recorded and toured with artists such as Amy Winehouse, The Arcs, St. Vincent, Foreigner, The Kills, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga, Sheryl Crow and others.


== Personal life ==
Steinweiss is an illustrator and dog lover, a foodie and occasionally blogs about the food he finds.
