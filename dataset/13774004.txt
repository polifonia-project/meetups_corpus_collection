In 1950, his father became a professor at Columbia University and moved the family to New York City.

In 1969, producer/vocalist/bassist Felix Pappalardi organized Mountain. The initial line-up included Leslie West (guitar/vocals) and N.D. Smart (drums). Prior to release of Mountain's debut album, Climbing!, Pappalardi, who had known Knight from prior musical affiliations, added him to the line-up on keyboards.

The band enjoyed a great deal of recording and touring success in the early 1970s including 3 gold albums, but called it quits in 1972. Knight then returned to traditional jazz.
