Thornhill was born in Barking but raised in Rayne near Braintree in Essex, and grew up as a football and James Brown fan.

In 2000, Thornhill left the band and went on to record various solo EPs under the names "Longman" and "Flightcrank", however these projects never saw any substantial success.
He now DJs at large venues and is still in touch with The Prodigy. During The Prodigy's "Their Law" tour Thornhill was the DJ support act at several venues. He also works as a regular DJ. He also remixed tracks for other artists, such as the Italian Subsonica's "Nuvole Rapide".
