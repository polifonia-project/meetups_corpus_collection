Hagibis (Filipino word meaning "velocity", "speed" or 'swiftness") is a Filipino disco group best known for their macho image, on-stage costumes, and macho songs about women. Originally formed by Juan dela Cruz Band singer and bassist Mike Hanopol and Vic del Rosario, they are cited as the "First Boyband in the Philippines" and later were coined the title "Village People of the Philippines", a title they still hold to this day. Their original line-up were composed of Sonny Parsons, Bernie Fineza, Mike Respall, Joji Garcia and Mon Picazo.


== History ==
According to Mike Hanopol, who composed almost all of Hagibis' tracks, Vic del Rosario wanted to recruit famous actors and singers for the new group; but later changed his mind, and instead, they recruited unknown musicians. Hanopol also revealed in the same interview that he also sung the band's recorded songs himself. Parsons also said during Hagibis' guest appearance on Tonight with Arnold Clavio, that he originally auditioned for VST & Co. before joining Hagibis. The group borrowed some elements of the American disco group, Village People, such the line dancing, the leather clothing, accompany with motorcycles.
In 1980, the film Dolphy's Angels was released. In it Hagibis has a musical number.
On the 2nd of July 1981, Tony Ferrer's directorial debut the musical film Legs... Katawan... Babae! premiered, it's a film vehicle for the group. The film co-stars Myrna Castillo, Laarni Enriquez, Dinah Dominguez  Val Iglesias, etc. That same year in Lito Lapid's Macho Gigolo, Hagibis performed the theme song.
Group member Sonny Parsons would go on in the film industry as a director and an action star.
The new lineup of Hagibis appeared at the Tonight with Arnold Clavio in 2014 and is still active until today. Original member Fineza died on January 15, 2015, while another original member Parsons passed away on May 10, 2020.
