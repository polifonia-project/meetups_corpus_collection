== Personal life ==
Lucia Cifarelli was born on September 23, 1970 in Long Island, New York. The youngest of four children, she grew up surrounded by music and art, developing a love for singing, songwriting and performing at an early age. Luciaâ€™s first vocal coach, Tanya Travers, whom she found in the Village Voice classified ads at fourteen, introduced Lucia to her first songwriting collaborator Dan Wise, who would later go on to produce such notable artists as Run-DMC, The New York Dolls, Ani Difranco, 22 Brides, John Mayor and The Scissor Sisters. Through an extensive network of songwriting collaborators, Lucia honed her songwriting chops in New York City by night, while attending high school by day.
Travers would later introduce Lucia to music producer Ric Wake, who signed her band Drill to A&M Records.
Due to a label restructuring, the band was dropped upon delivery of their sophomore effort and later broke up. Not long after Lucia joined MDFMK, an offshoot of KMFDM, where she co-wrote, recorded and toured with the band for their only album on Republic Records.
Before the reformation of KMFDM, Lucia secured a record deal with Universal Records and moved to London to record her first solo album From the Land of Volcanos with music producer Ian Stanley, one of the original members Tears for Fears. Universal later declined to release it.
Since the reformation of KMFDM, Lucia has been a featured vocalist and co-writer on every album since 2002 and has played 456 shows with the band as of January 2020.
In November 2019 Lucia began writing her long overdue follow-up solo album. On July 2, 2021, Lucia released the album I Am Eye.In July 2005, she married KMFDM founder and producer Sascha Konietzko. They live in Hamburg, Germany, her husband's hometown. The couple has one daughter (Annabella Asia Konietzko, born February 14, 2008).
