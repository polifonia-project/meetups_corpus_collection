Wasscass (born 1977) is a German techno producer and label head born in Spaichingen, currently based in Stansstad Switzerland .


== History ==
Growing up in a music-oriented family, Wasscass' life was filled with sounds of Kiss, Iron Maiden, Def Leppard or Judas Priest at a very early age already.
He became familiar with the world of EBM and Techno with records from Tommi Stumpff, Nitzer Ebb, Front Line Assembly and cubic22 from Berlin.
Buying his first turntables in 1992, he started his DJ career with his first gig as "al cutter" at club Cinderella in Tübingen in 1993.
He started the set with a 15-minute intro, followed by a solid gabba and hardcore set. Although this might have been the starting point, he was still missing a direction.
During those days, DJ Sven Väth fascinated all revelers with ingenious hardfloor from Frankfurt. Wasscass' encounter with Väth at Southern Germany's number 1 club "Oz" gave him the greencard for 1994's Futuresonic Party in Stuttgart, playing a set with four decks with flying colours.

Taking a break from DJing in 2001, he came back even bigger in 2007. Mainly being booked for industrial high-class rooftop parties always far from the mainstream, he also played all kinds of styles in clubs and radio stations, finding its peak at the Kazantip festival.
Nowadays, he only returns to the decks for the virtual community, despite not being the biggest supporter of social media.
In 1999 he opened his own club, "Alte Stilfabrik" (Nox Club), closing in 2002 due to conceptual deviations.
Wasscass started producing own tracks in 1996, never sticking to a certain style or genre.
Since then, he is producing several projects of different kinds of styles, with slaxory being the first sub-project evolving from the idea of a T-shirt label in 2008.
All of his projects have one thing in common - representing underground, aiming to establish a new genre, far from the norm. The latest release "Airport" is the best example.
He never reached for the limelight, avoiding commercial publicity wherever possible.
