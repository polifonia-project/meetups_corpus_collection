Andy Farag is the percussionist for progressive rock band Umphrey's McGee. He was brought into the band by original drummer Mike Mirro in early 1998, shortly after the release of their debut album Greatest Hits Vol. III. His first show as a member of the band was on 5 March 1998. Farag first appeared on disc with Umphrey's McGee on the 1999 live album Songs for Older Women and has remained with the band ever since.
Andy also enjoys creating hip-hop and R&B beats outside of Umphrey's McGee.  Some of these tracks have been released as part of the Mantis bonus material.
Like fellow Umphrey's McGee drummer Kris Myers, Farag uses Pearl hardware and Zildjian cymbals.  His percussion set also consists of various bongo, conga drums, and windchimes.
