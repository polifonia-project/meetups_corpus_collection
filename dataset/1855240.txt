== Career ==
Spitz began playing guitar after being inspired by the music of Judas Priest and Iron Maiden and his older brother David, who was also a musician. He formed a close bond with another local guitarist named Anthony Ammendolo and the two agreed to pursue a musical career together. They formed a garage band but never gained much of a local following. In 1981, Spitz and Ammendolo joined New Jersey thrash band Overkill after their original guitarist quit over the band's heavy drinking and unprofessionalism. Overkill, at that time, were a very theatrical band incorporating heavy use of stage makeup. Spitz and Ammendolo initially had no issues with the band's theatrical image but soon grew tired with it and left.Spitz soon became enthralled with the playing of Eddie Van Halen and began moving in a more melodic direction, and he and Ammendolo grew apart musically. In 1983, Spitz was a founding member of New York City's Anthrax, replacing lead guitarist Bob Berry. Spitz would remain Anthrax' lead guitarist and backing vocalist during their most successful period between 1983 and 1995, appearing on the albums Fistful of Metal, Armed and Dangerous, Spreading the Disease, Among the Living, State of Euphoria, Persistence of Time and Sound of White Noise, earning him multiple RIAA-certified gold and platinum records. Anthrax sold more than 30 million albums worldwide during this period.In 1995, Spitz left Anthrax to pursue a career in luxury Swiss watchmaking, attending the Swiss watchmaking school WOSTEP on a full scholarship. He was certified a Mechanical Complications Specialist, earning Swiss degrees in micro-mechanical engineering, and opened his own luxury watch service. In 2012 Spitz was voted the number 1 interview of the year for the watchmaking magazine Hodinkee. In 2016, the production company Great Big Story produced a documentary on Spitz's work as a watchmaker.Spitz reunited with Anthrax for a classic lineup reunion tour in 2005, appearing on the tour DVD Alive 2. He left the band again in 2008 to return to his watchmaking career. In 2010 Spitz formed a new Christian rock/metal band Red Lamb, which also included singer Don Chaffin from Voices of Extreme and keyboardist Chris Vrenna. Dave Mustaine was an early member but ultimately stepped back into a songwriting role with Spitz. Mustaine and Spitz wrote the song "Puzzle Box" which was claimed to be the first heavy metal song to deal with autism; the song's video featured Bob and Suzanne Wright, co-founders of Autism Speaks. In 2017, Spitz formed another Christian metal band with former Journey drummer Deen Castronovo.
