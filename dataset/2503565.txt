== Musical career ==


=== Billy Currington (2003–2004) ===
Currington's self-titled debut album was released in September 2003. The album's first single was "Walk a Little Straighter". This song is about his relationship with his alcoholic stepfather, including a chorus that Currington wrote when he was just 12 years old. "Walk a Little Straighter" went to number 8 that year on the Hot Country Songs chart. Also, it allowed Currington to become a major country performer in Nashville. The second single from the album, "I Got a Feelin'", became the singer's first Top 5 on the US country charts, with a peak at number 5.
He scored a third consecutive top 10 hit with Shania Twain in late 2004 with the song "Party for Two". The song was from Twain's Greatest Hits album and was released in two formats: a pop version with Mark McGrath as Twain's duet partner, and the country version, which featured Currington.


=== Doin' Somethin' Right (2005–2007) ===
In 2005, Currington released his second studio album Doin' Somethin' Right, which peaked at No. 2 on the Top Country Albums chart and at No. 11 on the Billboard 200. This album produced his first number one hit with "Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right", followed by "Why, Why, Why" at No. 13 and another number one hit with "Good Directions". Co-written by Capitol Records artist Luke Bryan, "Good Directions" was the No. 2 country song of 2007 according to the Billboard Year-End charts. Doin' Somethin' Right was certified platinum by the RIAA. The album also featured "Lucille", a song that Currington covered from original artist Kenny Rogers.


=== Little Bit of Everything (2007–2009) ===
On July 19, 2007, Currington announced that he would cancel the rest of his tour dates for the year because of laryngitis. His 2007 single, "Tangled Up", peaked at No. 30 in late 2007, and the release of his third studio album was delayed.He was absent from the charts for nearly a year before the release of his next single, "Don't", in mid-2008. That song was the first single from his third studio album, which was entitled Little Bit of Everything. The album was released on October 14. Currington co-wrote five of the songs on it. "Don't" peaked at No. 2 on the country charts in early 2009. "People Are Crazy", co-written by Bobby Braddock and Troy Jones, was released as the second single from the album in March 2009 and became his third number one hit in July 2009. The third single, "That's How Country Boys Roll", became his fourth number one hit in March 2010. The song was the first that Currington shared writing credit on to reach number one.
On August 1, 2009, Currington suffered a concussion at the Big Valley Jamboree in Camrose, Alberta after the stage on which he was performing collapsed during a massive wind storm that also injured the singer's bass guitarist and killed a spectator.


=== Enjoy Yourself (2010–2012) ===
In May 2010, Currington released his tenth single overall, "Pretty Good at Drinkin' Beer". That song hit No. 1 in September. Also written by Troy Jones, it was the first single from his fourth studio album Enjoy Yourself, which was released on September 21, 2010. The album's second single "Let Me Down Easy" was released on October 4, 2010 and reached No. 1 in 2011. The third single "Love Done Gone" released to country radio on April 18, 2011 and reached No. 11 later that year. Its fourth single "Like My Dog" released to country radio on October 10, 2011 and peaked at No. 24 in 2012.


=== We Are Tonight (2013–2014) ===
Currington's fifth studio album, We Are Tonight, was released on September 17, 2013. The album's first single, "Hey Girl", was released in March 2013. It peaked at number one on the Country Airplay chart in October of that year. The album's second single, the title track, was released on November 18, 2013. It also peaked at number one on the Country Airplay chart, this time in August 2014.


=== Summer Forever (2014–2017) ===
Currington released a new single, the first from his sixth studio album, in late October 2014, titled "Don't It". The album, Summer Forever, was released on June 2, 2015. The album's second single, "Drinkin' Town with a Football Problem", was released on June 8, 2015. "It Don't Hurt Like it Used To" was released on February 8, 2016 as the album's third single.

"Wake Me Up" is the album's fifth and final single, and it was released in September 2017.


=== Intuition (2018–present) ===
"Bring It On Over" was released to country radio on September 24, 2018. It debuted and peaked at number 29 on the Billboard Country Airplay charts. "Details" was released in 2019 and was also a minor top 40 hit on the same chart. The "Stay Up 'Til The Sun" Tour began on October 4, 2019, in Arizona and included nine concerts in total. He ended the tour in Florida.
Currington's seventh studio album, Intuition, was released on August 6, 2021. Currington co-wrote the album with producer Rob Persaud. It was a surprise release, in that it was not announced with advance warning and no new singles were released prior to the album to promote it, nor did it include either of his previous standalone singles. Intuition serves as a musical departure from his previous work as it was not marketed as a country album and instead drew inspirations from "synth pop, Eighties R&B, and tropical house."


== Personal life ==
On April 24, 2013, the Chatham County, Georgia, Grand Jury indicted Currington on felony criminal charges of "abuse of an elder person by inflicting mental anguish" and "making terroristic threats". Both criminal charges stem from an incident involving boat captain Charles Harvey Ferrelle on April 15, 2013. The indictment alleged that Currington had made terrorist threats to Ferrelle. Currington was later released from a Georgia jail after posting $27,700 bond. If convicted, Currington could have faced a prison term of 1 to 5 years. Also, on April 26, 2013, as a result of negative press surrounding the indictment incident, the Charlotte Motor Speedway replaced Currington as a performer for its All Star pre-race entertainment. He entered a "not guilty" plea in August 2013.On September 25, 2013, Currington pleaded no contest to the abuse charge; the terroristic threats charge was dropped. Currington was sentenced to five years probation, a $1000 fine, and anger management counseling; he is also required to have no contact with the boat captain.
