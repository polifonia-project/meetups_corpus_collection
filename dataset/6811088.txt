Rizzo said in an interview that he got no support from Soulfly during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rizzo went further saying “I was doing home renovations, working very hard, 10 hours a day,” he explained. “A Soulfly live record came out [last year, Live Ritual NYC MMXIX]. I never saw a dime of that. So basically, within the [first] six [or] seven months of Covid, I just said, ‘You know, man, I don't want this anymore. I gave you guys 18 years of my life, “And it was a great time. Back in the good years, it was great. But the last eight to 10 years have not been very good".In October 2021, Marc Rizzo returned to Ill Nino, where he became the original guitarist of the band since 1998 until his departure in 2003.
