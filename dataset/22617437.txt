Birge Lønquist Hansen (6 November 1945 – 27 August 2004), better known as Jodle Birge, was a Danish composer and singer. His most famous tracks were "Rigtige Venner" (Real Friends) from the norwegian singer/songwriter Håkon Banken and "Tre hvide duer" (Three white doves). Jodle Birge sold over two million CDs. From 1992 to 2001 there was a museum for Jodle Birge in Silkeborg in Denmark.
A new and bigger museum was opened on 22 July 2005.

=== Lyrics of Rigtige Venner ===
Jodle Birge, at least on one occasion, with a live audience, untruthfully claimed that he "created" the lyrics for the cover song "Rigtige Venner". This was a blatant lie, since it clearly was a straight translation to Danish of Håkon Banken's original Norwegian lyrics of Banken's original song "Riktige Venner" (which Jodle Birge was covering). Also, it's not really necessarily true that Jodle Birge even translated the lyrics himself, or if it was done by Ulrich Ravnbøl (or someone else).

Jodle Birge says: "Og, derfor, så har jeg lavet en dejlig tekst der hedder Rigtige Venner." ("And, therefore, I have created a lovely lyric called Real Friends.")
