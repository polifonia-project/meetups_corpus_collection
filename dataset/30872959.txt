== Biography ==
Born in 1943 in Ayer, Massachusetts, Aucoin attended Northeastern University and graduated with a degree in film. He worked at WGBH in Boston during his college years and after. Aucoin later worked at Teletape Productions as a cinematographer. Credited with discovering Kiss, Aucoin managed the group for nearly a decade. He was fired in 1982 due to a dispute about the band's appearance plus his drug abuse, but later worked with the band on various DVD projects.
Aucoin produced a television show called Supermarket Sweep in the early 1970s. From 2005 to 2007, Aucoin went into the Broadway business with a staging of The Who's Quadrophenia, which showed intermittently for two years in Anaheim and Los Angeles.
Aucoin had reentered the management business with his company Aucoin Globe Entertainment, at the time of his death of surgical complications from prostate cancer. He was survived by partner Roman Fernandez and sisters Betty Britton and Janet Bankowski. A statement from Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons described him as "our irreplaceable original manager, mentor and dear friend… Words cannot convey his impact on us or those close to him."
