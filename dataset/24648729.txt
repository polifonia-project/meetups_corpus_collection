Anders Öhrman: "I have always lived openly and I have stood for it all my life. And my parents have really been a fantastic support and never had any problems with it. I am fortunate to have such good parents. But when you find yourself in the spotlight, questions like  "coming out" comes up again. And I did not want to. It [coming out] should never be forced. But now I do not feel compelled, I like it here."
