László Weiner (9 April 1916 in Szombathely, Hungary – 25 July 1944 in Lukov) was a Hungarian composer, pianist and conductor who was murdered in the Holocaust.
Weiner studied piano and conducting at the Budapest Music Academy and was a composition student of Zoltán Kodály from 1934 to 1940. Weiner was married in 1942 to singer Vera Rózsa.
By February 1943, Weiner had been deported by the Nazis to the Lukov forced labor camp in Slovakia where he was later murdered. Kodály attempted to save Weiner and colleague Jenő Deutsch to no avail.Due to the efforts of violist Pál Lukács, several of Weiner's compositions were published by Editio Musica Budapest in the 1950s and 1960s.
