== Biography ==
In the summer of 1988, the Lady of Rage met Shahkim, now known as Black Rushn of the Original Outlaw Brothers, a rap group from Queens, New York. Once Shahkim convinced the Lady of Rage that he could get her a record deal, he brought her into his group. The members of the Outlaw Brothers made Rage a member of the group, and they eventually signed to a production deal with the L.A. Posse (who went on to produce several big hits for LL Cool J). At the time, the L.A. Posse had several artists within their group including, MC Wind, and the Real Roxanne. The L.A. Posse also had several relationships with different labels. Rage, along with all of the artists in the camp worked diligently writing and recording out of Chung King Studios in lower Manhattan. In 1991, the Lady of Rage met with Chubb Rock, providing vocals for the track "Bring Em Home Safe" on his album The One, which she recorded under the name of 'Rockin’ Robin'.Dr. Dre discovered the Lady of Rage after hearing the vocals she recorded for the L.A. Posse's album, They Come in All Colors (1991). She later  appeared on several tracks on Dr. Dre's 1992 album The Chronic, and on Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle in 1993.On July 26, 1994, the Lady of Rage released the hit single "Afro Puffs" (from the soundtrack to Above the Rim) which reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot Rap Singles chart.
