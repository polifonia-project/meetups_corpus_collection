Kieren Gallear also known as DELS (pronounced "Dels") is a British art recording artist, art director, graphics designer and filmmaker born in Ipswich, England, currently based in London. Gallear signed with the Ninja Tune imprint Big Dada in May 2010.


== GOB (2011) ==
DELS has released three singles, "Shapeshift", "Trumpalump" (produced by Hot Chip's Joe Goddard) and "GOB" (produced by Kwes), in 2010 and 2011. His debut album GOB (2011) was produced by Kwes, with Micachu engineering two tracks and Joe Goddard three tracks. DELS met all three producers via Myspace when the social networking site was at its peak of popularity.


== Critical acclaim ==
DELS was described as the "Future of UK Hip Hop" by British national newspaper The Times in their "Ones to Watch 2011" list in January 2011. Paul Lester of The Guardian has complimented Dickins for his ability to set himself apart from many homogeneous hip-hop artists by sounding both languid and urgent. Lester has described Dickins as "Dizzee mixed with the Bj√∂rk of Vespertina". DELS has received positive media coverage from BBC Radio 1 and 6 Music DJs such as Zane Lowe, Annie Mac, Huw Stephens, Reggie Yates, Huey Morgan and Lauren Laverne. DELS' single "Shapeshift" was listed by Dazed & Confused and Drowned in Sound as one of their top singles of 2010.


== Petals Have Fallen (2014) ==
Gallear's second album, Petals Have Fallen, was released on 3 November 2014. He said:
I met most of the people that contributed to this album on MySpace back in 2005. We had a page called "Loners", where myself and the likes of Kwes, Micachu, Ghostpoet, Sampha, Coby Sey, Elan Tamara and others were all featured. We always said that we'd do a proper album together eventually. Petals Have Fallen is probably the closest thing to that happening to date.


== Personal life ==
DELS is a fan of football club Arsenal and Japanese anime.
