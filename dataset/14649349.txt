Søren Hyldgaard (6 August 1962 – 7 May 2018) was a Danish film composer, also known for several New Age albums and for his concerts.

Hyldgaard received a prestigious artistic acknowledgement award from the San Diego Film Commission in Southern California for his achievements in film scoring. He also received several European film award nominations, including the Finnish National Film Academy's JUSSI Award as well as the Danish equivalent, the "Robert", for his film score for The One and Only (Den eneste Ene).
