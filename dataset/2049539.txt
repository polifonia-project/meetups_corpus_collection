Candy Flip were a British electronic music duo from Stoke on Trent, who were associated with the indie dance music scene in the early 1990s (a scene more commonly known as Madchester or baggy). They are best remembered for their cover version of the Beatles song "Strawberry Fields Forever", which was a No. 3 hit on the UK Singles Chart in 1990.


== Origins of name and formation ==
Candy Flip were named after "candyflipping", the slang term for the practice of taking ecstasy and LSD at the same time. The band was formed in 1990 by Danny Spencer (vocals, keyboards) and Ric Peet (keyboards), and was originally called Yin Yang.


== "Strawberry Fields Forever" and chart success ==
The duo had a top 10 UK hit single with an electronic cover of the Beatles' "Strawberry Fields Forever" in 1990. The track sampled the drum beat from James Brown's "Funky Drummer", overdubbing a hi hat and heavy reverb. Candy Flip's track was initially a club hit on the rave scene before crossing over into the pop chart. The track is now considered a "rave classic", and was reissued on vinyl in 2005 on S12 Records. The UK DJ remix service Disco Mix Club remixed the Candy Flip version, removing the beat and adding an interpolation of "Hey Jude" to the outro.
The B-side of the first 12" single contained another electronic track entitled "Can You Feel the Love". A second 12" single release featured the 'Raspberry Ripple Remix' of the lead track backed by "Rhythim of Love" (sic).
In 1991, Candy Flip released their first album, Madstock..., which combined rave beats with synthpop, strongly influenced by bands such as the Pet Shop Boys, New Order and the Beloved. A further two singles were released, the first being "Space" which made UK No. 98 and "This Can Be Real", which fared slightly better, reaching UK No. 60. Candy Flip split up in 1992.


== Recent activity ==
Peet became a record producer and engineer, working with bands such as the Charlatans and Six by Seven.Spencer, together with his brother Kelvin Andrews went on to form Sound 5, releasing the album No Illicit Dancing in 2000 on Gut Records, as well as providing remixes for other artists such as UK band Space.
More recently, Spencer and Andrews (as Soul Mekanik) produced four songs on the Robbie Williams album Rudebox (2006). Since then, Soul Mekanik have continued to work with Williams being credited as Central Midfield on his 2009 album Reality Killed the Video Star, co-writing ten of the tracks.
