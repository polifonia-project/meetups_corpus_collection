Ryan Moore is a Canadian musician known primarily for his dub project Twilight Circus, his long association with the influential experimental electronic rock band, The Legendary Pink Dots and the Tear Garden.


== Early career ==
He began as a bassist in the Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada music scene in the early 1980s. He was active in the nexus forged between punk rock and reggae, taking inspiration from the DIY ethic, which led him to begin his own label, M Records. In the late 1980s, Moore became part of the Nettwerk Records stable of artists and musicians where he remained for several years, working with numerous artists including Skinny Puppy's side project, Hilt, pop artists Lava Hay, Single Gun Theory,  Sarah McLachlan, and The Final Cut.In the early 1990s, he relocated to the Netherlands where he joined the Legendary Pink Dots. In addition to a busy schedule of tours and recording with the Legendary Pink Dots, Moore also recorded with the Tear Garden, Edward Ka-Spel, and Skinny Puppy. He also worked with the Canadian producer Darryl Neudorf's Miller Block studio collective, and released the first record in his dub and reggae project Twilight Circus.In addition to working as a bass player,  Moore toured as a live percussionist with the tribal techno outfit, Exquisite Corpse (from ex-Psychick Warriors ov Gaia member Robert Heynen and Debbie Jones),  playing at clubs on the 1990s UK rave scene including London's Megadog, and Pure at Glasgow Barrowlands.  A 1996 world tour as additional live drummer with the Skinny Puppy offshoot Download saw Moore moving into the role of live drummer, also on later tours and albums with the Legendary Pink Dots.


== Since 2000 ==
Since 2001, Ryan Moore has primarily been active with Twilight Circus.  He also produced artists such as Michael Rose (from the Grammy award-winning Black Uhuru), and collaborated with other artists such as DJ Spooky and Cevin Key.
