=== 1998–2006: Early life and career beginnings ===
Amanda Lucille Warner was born on September 12, 1982, in Fargo, North Dakota, where she was raised on a farm. Her father built a four-track reel-to-reel in the basement of the family's farmhouse, and when Warner was about nine or 10 years old, he taught her how to record on it. In 1998, when Warner transferred to Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, from Portland, Oregon, she met Brian Tester through Susan Lindell, a mutual friend, and the three formed the electronic pop band Triangle. A few months after the trio's self-titled four-track debut EP was released in 1999 on their own label, Smoke + Mirrors, Lindell left the band to join the touring musical Buddy: The Buddy Holly Story as a guitar tech.As a duo, Triangle released a second EP titled Peek Meeter in 2000 on Smoke + Mirrors, and after signing to the Philadelphia-based label File 13 Records, they released their full-length debut album, *, on October 16, 2001. Warner graduated from Macalester College in 2001 with a minor in chemistry and a major in double bass. In 2006, Triangle released their second album, Decimal Places, through Chicago's Essay Records.


=== 2009–2010: E.P.E. and "Bang Bang Bang" ===

Warner relocated from Oakland, California, to New York City in mid-2009 to work as a songwriter for hire, after a publishing company scout offered her a deal to write songs for mainstream artists. She soon met producer Peter Wade, and after months of writing with him, he suggested that she release an album under her own name. At the time, Warner designed a touring keyboard rig and played bass for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs during the making of their album It's Blitz! (2009). MNDR has since opened for bands such as Yacht, Massive Attack, Deerhoof, Miike Snow, Chromeo, The Ting Tings, and Duran Duran, and frequently collaborates with visual artist Jamie Carreiro, who provides visual effects for her live shows. Warner and Wade uploaded four tracks to Myspace in 2009, which eventually became MNDR's debut EP, E.P.E., released on April 6, 2010, on Wade's WonderSound Records. The EP was preceded by MNDR's debut single, "C.L.U.B.", released on March 24, 2009.Warner has performed under the moniker MNDR since 2005, around the time she was performing in the Bay Area. The name was given to her by a Fargo friend, who called her "Mandar" while she was still in high school. The spelling and design were inspired by early Detroit techno, early Chicago house, and German techno. Warner explained, "MNDR is a group with Peter Wade in the sense that we make and write all of the music. However, I perform as a solo artist and all that comes with that."After hearing some of MNDR's music, English producer Mark Ronson invited Warner on his East Village Radio show in 2010, where he played one of her songs. Ronson asked if she would like to write on his third album, Record Collection (released under the moniker Mark Ronson & The Business Intl), resulting in what would become the album's lead single, "Bang Bang Bang", which features vocals by Warner and Q-Tip. Written by Warner, Wade, Ronson, and Q-Tip, the song was released on July 9, 2010, reaching number six on the UK Singles Chart.MNDR performed "Bang Bang Bang" with Mark Ronson & The Business Intl and Q-Tip on several television shows, including Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on July 2, 2010, Later... with Jools Holland on September 17, Late Show with David Letterman on October 11, and Jimmy Kimmel Live! on October 14. She later joined Mark Ronson & The Business Intl and toured the US, Europe, and Australia for a year, while also touring as MNDR in her free time.


=== 2011–2013: Feed Me Diamonds ===
In October 2011, MNDR signed to Ultra Music. Her first single with the label, "#1 in Heaven", was released on January 17, 2012. MNDR told Spin magazine that the lyrics are inspired by kidnapped heiress Patty Hearst, commenting, "The lyrics to the chorus are her words [...] After she was arrested for robbing a bank where someone was murdered, her only press statement was, 'Tell them [my brothers and sisters] I am smiling and send my greetings.'" The accompanying music video was directed by Ssion lead singer Cody Critcheloe and takes inspiration from women such as Jane Fonda, Wendy O. Williams, and Valerie Solanas. In an interview with Coup De Main magazine in February 2012, MNDR revealed that her debut studio album was titled Feed Me Diamonds, adding that the title track is a homage to performance artist Marina Abramović."Faster Horses" was released on July 17, 2012, as the second single from Feed Me Diamonds. The song is inspired by the Henry Ford quote, "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." The album was released on August 14, 2012, by Ultra Music, and was streamed in full on the Spin website the previous day. The title track was released on December 17, 2012, as the album's third single, and its music video stars drag queen and former RuPaul's Drag Race contestant Raven.
