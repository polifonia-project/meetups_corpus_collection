Sonika Simone Singh Chauhan (12 July 1989 – 29 April 2017) was an Indian model, actress, and a TV host. She was a contestant at Femina Miss India and Miss Diva - 2013.


== Biography ==
She was born on 12 July 1989 the only child to a Christian mother, Sharon Singh Chauhan and a Hindu father, Vijay Singh Chauhan. She was schooled at La Martiniere, Kolkata. She completed her higher education at Mount Carmel College, Bengaluru.


== Death ==

Sonika sustained a fatal head injury in a car accident in the early hours of 29 April 2017. The vehicle belonged to Vikram Chatterjee, who was behind the wheel at the time of the accident. Vikram took Sonika to Ruby Hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries. Vikram initially denied that he was either speeding or under the influence of alcohol at a press conference, but forensic reports have confirmed that he was driving at a speed of 100–110 km/h just seconds before the collision with a jewellery store and a flag post on Kolkata's Rashbehari Avenue. Initially, Vikram was only booked under Section 304 A (death due to negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). But after a massive public outcry, police added the non-bailable section 304 (culpable homicide) against the actor. He was arrested on 7 July 2017 after a period during which he was absconding, and released on bail on 26 July 2017.
