== Biography ==
Educated at Inverness Royal Academy, MacGregor studied history at Edinburgh University followed by a post-graduate Business Diploma in Business Administration from Napier University
MacGregor started working at BBC Radio Scotland in 1994 as a researcher before becoming a producer and presenter. He produced and presented The Strathspey King in 2000 and The Captain's Collection 1999; both shows won Golden Torque awards at the International Celtic Media Awards.

The Strathspey King was toured as a play produced by Dogstar Theatre.“…a colourful roller coaster of huge successes and dramatic failures…Billy Riddoch brought the character alive in a vibrant and sympathetic fashion, fuelled by Hamish MacDonald’s sensitive and often very funny script……Scott Skinner’s music was also in good hands. Fiddler Bruce MacGregor and cellist Christine Hanson performed his tunes live throughout, and were worth the admission money on their own…This was a piece of imaginative and beautifully realised music theatre honouring a flawed genius of Scottish music.”MacGregor played amateur rugby, captaining Inverness-based Highland Rugby Club]
MacGregor was also captain of Edinburgh University Rugby Club, winning the Scottish Universities Cup in 1992, touring Zimbabwe in 1990 and South America in 1992. MacGregor also represented Scottish Universities (1991 &92) and Scottish students (1991)
