She received a scholarship from the Internationales Musikinstitu Darmstadt in Germany.Agudelo is the founder of the chamber ensemble group Onix Ensamble and was a founding member of the Mexican Society of New Music. Agudelo has published a number of articles and essays and headed the official journal of the National School of Music of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. She is the author of the Musical Initiation GAM Method for Children (ENM / UNAM, 1998) and Man and Music (Patria, 1998). In 2002 she received the Xochipilli award for outstanding creativity in the field of music in Mexico.
