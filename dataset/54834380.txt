After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, there was definitely a need for a formal organization on a national level to encourage the classical musicians/vocalists living in obscurity and feeling neglected.

APMC started holding a six-day music festival starting in 1960 where classical, semi-classical, folk and light music events (including ghazal evenings) were held to promote the cause of music in Pakistan.Pakistan's Dawn (newspaper) comments in 2014, "The event has a huge contribution towards introducing new talent to music fanciers of the country and revitalizing classical and semi-classical music through seasoned musicians and singers." This music festival has been held in Pakistan for more than last five decades now. "Ever since its inception, it has been a constant source of inspiration for thousands of music lovers nationwide."
