== Style and influence ==
Lee is noted for his distinctive, intricate dancing style, which often incorporates elements of contemporary dance. His frequent use of androgynous fashion and heavy make-up, especially starting from his 2017 single "Move", has become one of his trademarks.
I wanted to go beyond what K-pop typically is perceived as, and through "Move" I was able to show a concept that’s more edgy, more powerful. Not only that, but regardless of the gender, I believe that all of the audience will be able to enjoy and listen to this as something different from most of what’s coming out in K-pop. (...) My aim was to find a middle ground, mixing both masculine and feminine movements into the choreography together.
- Lee on "Move"The choreography to the song "Move", created by Japanese choreographer and Lee's frequent collaborator Koharu Sugawara, went viral in Korea, spurring many dance covers by both fans and celebrities. The phenomenon was dubbed "Move disease". Lee is recognized as the pioneer of the genderless trend in the performance of male K-pop idols.Lee's discography is predominantly pop and R&B, with occasional influences of rock, hip-hop, trap and electro, and is notably darker in theme compared to his work with Shinee. His songs' concepts cover a wide range of topics, such as love, lust, self-discovery, philosophy and faith. His music videos, known for their sensual character, are often choreography focused, and frequently contain biblical references, particularly in "Want" and "Idea".
