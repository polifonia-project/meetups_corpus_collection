=== Early life ===
Spike Dawbarn was born in Warrington, Cheshire to parents Mo and Mike Dawbarn. He also has two brothers. Although he attended some dance college afterwards, his secondary education ended at the age of sixteen when he could not get a grant to go to a London stage school. He had a brief spell as a bricklayer on a building site, a position from which he was sacked. He acquired the nickname 'Spike' because of his hairstyle.


=== The Hit Man and Her and 911 ===
Dawbarn went on to become a dancer on the ITV late night dance show The Hit Man and Her. In this role he worked alongside 'talents' such as Jimmy Constable and Jason Orange. In 1995, Dawbarn and Constable formed a partnership and teamed up with frontman Lee Brennan to form 911. Their first hit got to number 38 on the UK Singles Chart, with subsequent releases rising higher. Dawbarn choreographed a number of the band's dance routines.


=== PopSkool ===
Since 911's split in February 2000, Dawbarn has made a career joining the other band members in reunion tours. He was also director of a pop academy youth programme, PopSkool. PopSkool started in his home town of Warrington and has spread across the UK. It taught afternoon programmes in modern dance and vocal training to children between the ages of eight and sixteen. Dawbarn provided choreographic expertise and voice coaching is provided by Brennan. On 15 October 2009, Dawbarn appeared on Never Mind the Buzzcocks's identity parade round, but Phill Jupitus's team failed to pick him out.
