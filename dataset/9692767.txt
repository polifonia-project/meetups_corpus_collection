Charles-Édouard Lefebvre (19 June 1843 – 8 September 1917) was a French composer.
Lefebvre was born in Paris, the son of painter Charles Lefebvre, and studied with Charles Gounod and Ambroise Thomas at the Paris Conservatoire. In 1870, he was awarded the Prix de Rome together with Henri Maréchal (1842–1924) for the cantata Le Jugement de Dieu. He was awarded the Prix Chartier for his compositions twice, in 1884 and 1891. In 1895 he succeeded Benjamin Godard as director of the Paris Conservatoire's chamber music class.  According to Elaine Brody's entry on him in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1980), "In his own words, he worked in pastels rather than oils." He died in Aix-les-Bains, Savoie, aged 74.
