=== 2000–2007: The Dresden Dolls and The Onion Cellar ===

At a Halloween party in 2000, Palmer met drummer Brian Viglione and afterwards they formed The Dresden Dolls. In an effort to expand the performance experience and interactivity, Palmer began inviting Lexington High School students to perform drama pieces at the Dresden Dolls' live shows. This evolved to The Dirty Business Brigade, a troupe of seasoned and new artists, performing at many gigs.In 2002, after developing a cult following, the band recorded their eponymous debut album, The Dresden Dolls, with producer Martin Bisi (of Indie, Brooklyn, New York fame). They produced the album before signing with the label Roadrunner Records.In 2006, The Dresden Dolls Companion was published, with words, music and artwork by Amanda Palmer. In it she has written a history of the album The Dresden Dolls and of the duo, as well as a partial autobiography. The book also contains the lyrics, sheet music, and notes on each song in the album, all written by Palmer, as well as a DVD with a 20-minute interview of Amanda about making the book.Palmer conceived the musical/production The Onion Cellar, based on a short story from The Tin Drum by Günter Grass. From December 9, 2006, through January 13, 2007, The Dresden Dolls performed the piece in conjunction with the American Repertory Theater at the Zero Arrow Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts. While Palmer was openly frustrated with the direction of the show, fan and critical reviews were very positive.In June 2007, as part of the Dresden Dolls, she toured with the True Colors Tour 2007, including her debut in New York City's Radio City Music Hall, and her first review in The New York Times.Though the Dresden Dolls broke up in 2008, Palmer and Viglione have continued to collaborate, and have had several minor reunions under the band name in 2011, 2012, 2016, 2017, and 2018.


=== 2007–2010: Who Killed Amanda Palmer, Evelyn Evelyn, and theatrical work ===

In July 2007, Palmer played three sold-out shows (in Boston, Hoboken, and NYC) in a new "with band" format. Her backing band was Boston alternative rock group Aberdeen City, who also opened along with Dixie Dirt. In August 2007, Palmer traveled to perform in the Spiegeltent and other venues at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland, and also performed on BBC Two's The Edinburgh Show. She collaborated with Australian theater company The Danger Ensemble; both again appeared at the Spiegeltent in Melbourne and at other venues around Australia in December 2007.

In September 2007, Palmer collaborated with Jason Webley to launch the new project Evelyn Evelyn with the EP Elephant Elephant. In the project, the duo play conjoined twin sisters named Eva and Lyn, and through their music tell their fictional backstory.
In July 2008, the Dresden Dolls released a second book, the Virginia Companion, a follow-up to The Dresden Dolls Companion, featuring the music and lyrics from the Yes, Virginia...(2006) and No, Virginia...

== Personal life ==

Palmer used to reside in Boston, Massachusetts, with other artists in a cooperative named the Cloud Club.She has identified as bisexual, telling afterellen.com in 2007: "I'm bisexual, but it's not the sort of thing I spent a lot of time thinking about," Palmer said. "I've slept with girls; I've slept with guys, so I guess that's what they call it! I'm not anti trying to use language to simplify our lives." Palmer has spoken out on feminist issues and about her open relationships, stating in one interview that "I've never been comfortable in a monogamous relationship in my life. I feel like I was built for open relationships just because of the way I function. It's not a reactive decision like, 'Hey I'm on the road, you're on the road, let's just find other people.' It was a fundamental building block of our relationship. We both like things this way."Palmer has said that she once worked as a stripper under the name Berlin. She has stated that the song "Berlin" was written about this experience.Palmer has had three abortions, and her song "Voicemail for Jill" is about these experiences.Neil Gaiman and Palmer confirmed their engagement in 2010 and Palmer hosted a flash mob wedding (not legally binding) for Gaiman's birthday in New Orleans later the same year. The couple legally married in a private ceremony in 2011. The wedding took place in the parlor of writers Ayelet Waldman and Michael Chabon. They have a son, Anthony "Ash", born on September 16, 2015.During the global pandemic of COVID-19 that struck at the end of 2019, Amanda Palmer was on an international tour of her latest album, There Will Be No Intermission, when countries started grounding flights and locking down borders. Palmer found herself in Havelock North, Hawke's Bay, the last stop on her tour schedule, and on 25 March 2020, New Zealand's government announced that the whole country would move to COVID-19 Alert Level 4: complete lockdown and quarantining of people within their own homes. Before that, Palmer had quickly brought her husband Neil Gaiman and son Ash to join her in New Zealand, searching for a suitable place to stay, in anticipation that they would be under lockdown for several months. Both the musician and the author confirmed that their upcoming shows in June 2020 would have to be cancelled and audiences refunded.At some publicly unknown point during the couple's stay in Havelock North, their marriage underwent difficulties. When New Zealand loosened its flight restrictions, Neil Gaiman took a flight back to the United Kingdom while Amanda Palmer and their son stayed in New Zealand, prompting outrage in his home country for breaking lockdown rules to do so. On 3 May 2020, Palmer announced on her personal Patreon that she and Gaiman had separated and were indeed no longer together in New Zealand. Palmer explained that she could not fully elaborate on the cause of their separation, for the sake of their son, and requested privacy. The couple later released a joint statement clarifying that they were not, however, getting divorced. They reconciled in 2021.Palmer practices meditation and wrote an article titled "Melody vs. Meditation" for the Buddhist publication Shambhala Sun, which described the struggle between songwriting and being able to clear the mind to meditate.
