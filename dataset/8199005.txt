Arve Henriksen (born 22 March 1968) is a Norwegian trumpeter whose flute-like sound was inspired by the Japanese shakuhachi flute.


== Career ==

Henriksen was born in Stranda and educated on the Jazz program at Trondheim Musikkonservatorium; he later studied  music pedagogy, while he played in «Bodega Band» (1987–88), «Luft» (1987–89), «Veslefrekk» from 1989, «Close Enough» 1990–92, «Nutrio» from 1990, and recorded with Bjørn Alterhaug and «Tre Små Kinesere» (1990). After graduating  in 1991, he joined the «Trio Midt-Norge» and «Piggy Bop».He has played among others with Misha Alperin, Jon Balke's Magnetic North Orchestra, Nils Petter Molvær, Audun Kleive, Trygve Seim, Terje Isungset, Christian Wallumrød and recently with Iain Ballamy's Food for Quartet  and Supersilent, both bands signed on Rune Grammofon. He has also contributed to David Sylvian's Nine Horses project and his latest work, When Loud Weather Buffeted Naoshima.He also sings; his unique wordless vocalising was central to Chiaroscuro, where he often sings in a soprano's range. The control over his head voice is such that in "Opening Image" he could quite easily be mistaken for a woman.With Supersilent he has been a major contributor to one of the most acclaimed improvisational bands over the last 14 years in Norway, with collaborations with Terje Rypdal among others. John Paul Jones played with them at the Punkt festival 2010, in Kristiansand, Norway and again at Moldejazz 2012.John Kellman of the All About Jazz magazine recognized Arve Henriksen/Jan Bang Double CD Release Show at The Punkt Festival, Kristiansand, Norway, September 2013, as no. 17 of his "Best Live Shows of 2013".
