Prior to his musical career, Lyttle had subsisted on day jobs, such as customs officer and radio disc jockey. Investing his savings of EC$1,500, Lyttle recorded "Turn Me On" as a soca ballad in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2001, and the song subsequently became a radio hit throughout the Caribbean.Lyttle signed with Atlantic Records in 2003 and a remixed version of "Turn Me On" was officially released as a single in the UK at the end of the year, with dancehall pop artist Spragga Benz's guest vocals. The song reached number two in the UK, spending seven weeks in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart. It eventually became a worldwide hit in 2004, reaching number 4 in the United States, number 3 in Australia and placing within Top 5 in many European countries.
