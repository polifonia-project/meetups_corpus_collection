== Early life ==
Kennedy William Gordy (also  known as Rockwell) is the son of Motown founder and CEO Berry Gordy and Margaret Norton. His father named him Kennedy William after John F. Kennedy and William "Smokey" Robinson.


== Career ==
To avoid the appearance of nepotism, he secured his record deal without his father's knowledge. Motown actually came up with the name Rockwell and the young Gordy agreed to the change because he believed he "rocked well."
In 1984, Rockwell had his biggest single, "Somebody's Watching Me", with childhood friend Michael Jackson singing the chorus lyrics and Jermaine Jackson singing back-up. "Somebody's Watching Me" became a Gold-certified million selling #2 song in the US, which also peaked at #6 in the UK. It held #1 on Billboard's R&B chart for five weeks. Follow-up singles underperformed, with "Obscene Phone Caller" being Rockwell's only other Top 40 single. It reached #35 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rockwell released two more albums before ending his musical career with Motown.
Rockwell was not the first member of the Gordy family to hit Billboard's Hot 100 as a recording artist. His uncle, Robert Gordy, reached the longer reaches of the chart in 1958 with "Everyone Was There," recording under the name of Bob Kayli.In early 2021 the first single from Somebody’s Watching Me was re-released on streaming services for the first time ever.
In late 2021 a brand new Deluxe version of the Somebody's Watching Me album, that includes many remixes, instrumentals, and 12” mix’s. A new remix of Somebody's Watching Me (mainly with Michael Jackson's vocals although uncredited) was released following the song's blow up on TikTok.
