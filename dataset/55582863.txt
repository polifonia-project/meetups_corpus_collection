In early 1992, Misuzu and Mari were part of the Japanese idol group "DALI" who debuted with their only single "Moonlight Densetsu", which was used as opening theme for anime television series Sailor Moon. Soon after release of the single, the group disbanded.
During the same year in December, Misuzu and Mari formed the band and debuted with single Koibito to Sakebenai (恋人と呼べない). Their second single, Koe ni Naranaihodo ni Itoshii (声にならないほどに愛しい) was written by vocalist and lyricist of Japanese rock band Wands, Uesugi Show which he later self-covered in their studio album Little Bit. This became one of their earlier hits and first single awarded by RIAJ with Golden Disk.

Some fans refer to them as the "female version" of Japanese hard-rock band B'z due to their similar power-pop melody in theirs songs and having same musical producer, Masao Akashi.
