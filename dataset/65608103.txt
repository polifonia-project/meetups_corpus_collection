== Career ==


=== Jennanykind (1991 - 2012) ===
Michael Holland is a founding member of the rock band Jennyanykind that was primarily active in the 1990s alternative music scene. Jennyanykind was discovered by legendary A&R executive Terry Tolkin and signed to his own No. 6 Records. Jennyanykind released three recordings on No. 6 Records between 1993 - 1995:
Etc... (1994)
Blues of the Afflicted (EP)(1995)
Mythic (1995)In late 1995, Tolkin signed the band to Elektra Records. Revelater, recorded with producer Dave Fridman was the band's only Elektra release.
In 1998, Jennyanykind signed with Yep Roc Records and released the self-produced Big Johns the same year. After a second release on Yep Roc, I Need You, recorded and released the following year, the band retired.
Jennyanykind reunited in 2003 and recorded Peas and Collards for MoRisen Records, and again in 2011 for a split single with The Moaners on the label Holidays for Quince. The song from that single, "Jam Up and Jelly Tight", also appeared in the film The World Made Straight.


=== Solo (2003 - present) ===
As a solo artist, Holland has been active off and on since his initial album Bootlegger's Dreams, recorded in 1999 after Jennyanykind retired was released in 2003 on his own Big John's label. In 2002, he was a SXSW critics pick for his show at the original Antone's. During this time, Holland occasionally played with local bluegrass group Big Fat Gap Band, and eventually asked them to back him up on the recording sessions that would become what has been called a visionary album, Tomorrows American Treasures, released on Sit-n-Spin Records in 2005. Holland was also featured as an up-and-coming artist in American Way Magazine in 2006.Tomorrows American Treasures caught the ear of German label Moll Tontr√§ger owner Jan Szlovak, which resulted in a collection of songs that nodded towards traditional country music, Simple Truths and Pleasures in 2008. Holland continued exploring more American themes in the Szlovak-funded album Rhythm of Love, recorded with a cast of musicians named The Occoneechee String Band for the project.
In 2020, Holland released two Christmas-themed songs, "Those Christmas Lights", and "The Fatman Rocks", originally written for the film Fatman, with proceeds from sales being donated to St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital.


=== The Holland Bros (2013 - present) ===
Since 2013, Michael Holland has recorded and performed with twin brother and former Jennyanykind bandmate Mark Holland as The Holland Bros., a musical duo that focuses on a pre-war music mix of covers and originals that cover country and piedmont blues, jugband, folk, and country.
