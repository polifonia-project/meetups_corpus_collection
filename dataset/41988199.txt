Hackman has described it as "probably the poppiest song I’ve ever written".The Guardian, in a four-star review, observed that, on Hackman's "most accomplished record to date", she "flits between self-reflection and self-loathing" in "glorious songs" characterised by "a general wry frankness". Pitchfork called the album "a singular, extraordinarily horny, and occasionally bleak pop record", about "those quiet moments of reckoning with what it means to be alive, young, and cautiously enamoured of it all", also observing Hackman, with her "coolly unimpressed alto" as "not interested in being coy or mincing words". The Independent's review calls the album "blunt and bold" with a "dark sexual energy" on which "Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals".For this album cycle, Hackman toured in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States.
