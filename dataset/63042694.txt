Following the incident, Ilić had moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands, together with his partner, where he purchased a flat in order to join the rest of his family. Ilić had stated that he had resolved on this decision following the outcry of the Serbian public following Đukić's suicide, claiming that the situation had escalated to the point where he had received serious death threats. He had further announced that he will most likely cease streaming on YouTube, stating that doing streaming was too time-consuming and that it was not as profitable anymore   
In 2020, Serbian rapper Voyage, released his opinion that Serbian Youtubers are not in the same rank as Serbian musicians, after which Prase decided to create videos and a diss-track against Voyage's claims. During an interview in 2020, Jelena Karleuša admonished Youtubers (including Prase) for gaining fame undeservedly and shutting out "talented singers" from becoming famous. Prase and Karleuša exchanged response videos criticizing the other. Another Serbian folk singer, Aca Lukas, was asked in an interview what his opinion on Prase was and he criticized Prase, saying that he never heard of him or his work.Croatian YouTube influencer Filip Rožman, better known as KakoLako, created a 37 minutes long video called "Drama Salama - Baka Prase", in which he is criticizing Ilić on a wide variety of topics including his music career and for being a hypocrite.

Another girl started making Tik-Tok & Twitter posts, where she exposes Ilić supposedly having sexual explicit chats with minors, to which Ilić responded that most of them faked or never told their ages, and that one of the chats was fabricated, and that he is making a criminal complaint over the false claim. Because of the claims, Ilić's sponsors dropped him. The allegations motivated Ilić to make a music video for the song named "Lična", which got age-restricted, and taken down from the Serbian YouTube trending list for being too explicit.  On Twitter, a video appeared of Ilić supposedly possessing cocaine during the creation of the music video, to which Ilić responded that it was just rice.
