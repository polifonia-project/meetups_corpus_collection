Jamila Omar Bouamout (Arabic: جميلة بو عمرت), better known as Laila Ghofran (Arabic: ليلى غفران; alt Laila Ghofrane, Layla Ghofran; born March 19, 1961) is an Arabic singer. She is originally from Morocco and holds Egyptian citizenship.
Ghofran rose to stardom thanks to her strong, unique voice. She started her singing career in the mid-1980s and her songs were popular. She is called the "Sultana of Tarab".


== Career ==
Ghofran's career began in the 1980s but really picked up between 1988 and 1998, elevating her to the status of Arab diva, in part due to the work of her husband and manager Ibrahim Aakad. She released her first album “Oyounak Amari” in 1989. She broke through with the song “Bahibak, Bahibak” in 1992.
Ghofran found her way to audiences with her very successful remakes of songs of the legendary Egyptian singer Abdelhalim Hafez in 1996. Her performances  of “Gabbar”, “Kamel El Awsaf” and “Hobbak Nar” remain widely appreciated.
Her greatest hits include “Law Hata Hayerfodny El Alam”, “Bahibak, Bahibak”, “Es’alou Eddourouf”, “Asahelhalak”, "El Garh Men Naseebi" among others.


== Personal life ==
Ghofran has been married six times and is the mother of two daughters.
Her daughter, Hiba, was murdered in 2008 along with her friend. In June 2010, Mahmoud Essawy was sentenced to death for the double-murder case.
