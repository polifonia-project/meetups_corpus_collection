By 1956, Gayles had joined the band now based in East St. Louis, mainly as a vocalist. That year, Turner took the band to Cincinnati to record for Federal Records. The single, "I'm Tore Up" / "If I Never Had Known You," featuring Gayles singing lead, became a regional hit. Gayles briefly left Turner's band to pursue a solo career.
