Eric Zann is an alias of electronic musician Jim Jupp (along with Belbury Poly). Jupp's releases are on the Ghost Box Music label, of which he is a co-founder. The name references a minor H. P. Lovecraft short story, The Music of Erich Zann.


== Eric Zann's sound ==
Zann's sound is deliberately darker and more Gothic than other Ghost Box artists, containing elements of Hammer Horror soundtracks, ambient music and drones; in Jupp's words, "it's full of crows, church bells, magick spells and other gothic clich√©s".
