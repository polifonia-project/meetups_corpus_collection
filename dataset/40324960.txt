Then a curious thing happened, the long haired man stepped through the door into the studio where the musicians were and walked over to the guitar player and sat down in front of him. The two had about a 30 minute conversation as they jammed on the guitarist's instruments and the visitor especially liked the Bartell fretless guitar. After the jam, The man walked back into the booth and he and his followers left. The guitarist in the studio was Mike Deasy who asked someone, "Who was that?" and they told him that Mike had just jammed with George Harrison of The Beatles. The guitar was made by Bartell of California
