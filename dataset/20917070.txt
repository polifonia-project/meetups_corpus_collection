She hosted Eunice and Francesca Shriver to raise awareness for Special Olympics-Bahamas. She also brought Magic Johnson to the Bahamas Chamber of commerce to advise on trade with the US.A State Department inspector general's report on the U.S. Embassy in the Bahamas praised the Ambassador and the embassy noting that the "large and diverse law enforcement community in Mission Bahamas works well together, under the Ambassador’s leadership, to counter threats to U.S. national security." the report also noted that the Ambassador and the new deputy chief of mission, whom she had hired, were "emerging strongly from a
period of dysfunctional leadership and management."The inspector general found Nicole Avant was frequently away from the embassy often traveling to and from her home in Los Angeles.  When she was in the Bahamas, she often worked from her office at the residence rather than working at the embassy. Nicole Avant "was absent from [her] post for 276 days during a 670-day period from November 19, 2009, to September 19, 2011—an average of 12 days per month. The 276 days include ... 102 personal leave days. [She] also traveled to the United States for 77 work days on what she identified as business, with 23 days on what appear to have been official travel orders." The report found she "had not had frequent policy-level interaction with the [State] Department or other Washington agencies ... She relied unduly on her [deputy chief of mission] to attend to day-to-day contacts with the [State] Department." The report offered praise for the service levels from the consular section, noted an "invigorated" public affairs section and reported that "she (Avant) and her staff have improved the embassy’s reputation among Bahamians. This, in turn, has fostered a close bilateral environment that is conducive to
excellent law enforcement cooperation."In response, Avant said that she had inherited a dysfunctional embassy, and the new executive team she appointed had improved things.Nicole Avant resigned in November 2011 and informally worked on Barack Obama's 2012 re-election efforts, including fundraising.
