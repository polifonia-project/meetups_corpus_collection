John Ford, (born 24 July 1985) better known by his stage name Joyryde (stylised as JOYRYDE), is an English DJ and producer, son of John Ford (also known as John Phantasm and owner of Phantasm Records).


== Early career ==
Inspired by his father John Phantasm (and consequently the music he heard playing at home when he was young), Ford started producing his own music in the studio from the age of 9 but did not begin DJing worldwide until he was 13. Wrapped up in the life of DJing, Ford did not return to the studio until he was 15, which was when he 'wanted to get back into the producing part of it since the music was getting more technical'. Not until then did he start producing under the name of Eskimo. The name was chosen because it bears no connection 'to the product'. At age 17 he released his first album Can You Pick Me Up.
Eskimo's music began to show up in the sets of psytrance DJs across the globe. By the time he performed his first live set, his repertoire had trebled. His many remixes from this time - some still unreleased due to copyright wrangles - included Infected Mushroom and Skazi, but it was his unofficial remix of The Prodigy "Voodoo People" that was most popular.
In summer 2004, Eskimo released his second artist album "Take A Look Out There" which included the well-known "Party Pooper", a track sampling the police shutting down a free party. November 2005 saw the release of Balloonatic Part One. Balloonatic Part Two followed in September 2006.
From 2011 to 2015, Ford was a member of electronic music duo Lets Be Friends, which such singles as "Manslaughter" and "FTW". The duo has been inactive since his transition to performing as Joyryde.


== Joyryde ==
Since 2015, Ford has produced bass-heavy house music, solo, under the name Joyryde. He has released all free downloads so far, such as "Flo" and "Speed Trap".
In 2016, Joyryde signed onto OWSLA, releasing singles "Hot Drum" and "Damn" on the record label in 2016 and releasing "I Ware House" and "New Breed" on the label in 2017. He shifted labels to Hard Records in 2019 and released his debut LP, Brave, in 2020.
