She also released the music videos for "Hush" and "U Over Them" during this year. The website Kick Kick Snare named Liz as their favorite solo artist of 2013 and stated that her melodies "bend, twist, and weave around the nostalgic backing tracks in just the right way" and that she was "90's influenced, but forward thinking". In addition to this, Charli XCX asked her to open for her True Romance U.S. Tour alongside KITTEN. It was during this tour that Liz sold her Tour CD.
In 2014, Liz released her seven track EP Just Like You which she made available to download for free through her SoundCloud. She also collaborated with Pharrell Williams for the song "That's My Man," which appeared on The Amazing Spider-Man 2 soundtrack. The music video for this song was released the same year as well as her music video for "All Them Boys."
Liz had met and collaborated with producer Sophie for the song "When I Rule the World" in 2014 but it was not released until 2015. It first appeared in a Samsung commercial and then later appeared in an episode of MTV's Scream. Shortly following the song's release was its music video which gained a lot of attention for its over-the-top glossy and early 2000s aesthetic and hyperpop sound. The song made both The Guardian's and The Idolator's list for "one of the best songs of 2015."During October 2016, Liz released her mixtape, Cross Your Heart, which she made available to stream through her SoundCloud. It was a 33-minute, one-track file consisting of 16 different songs made with producers such as Henrik the Artist, Lido, Mess Kid, King Henry, and Valentino Khan. To complement the mixtape, Liz teamed up with Nicopanda to create a five-part fashion editorial. During the shoot, Liz had to continuously put glycerine on her face to achieve the "plastic" look seen in the photos. The mixtape received a lot of positive press which included Noisey calling it "one of 2016's most forward-thinking pop releases."Liz has stated that being influential and being a "tastemaker" is important to her and her musical career. She places high value on being able to progress with music and pop culture and does not follow music trends without fully understanding the source of that music's origin.On November 15, 2019, Liz released her first full-length studio album Planet Y2K under Moving Castle with the singles "Diamond in the Dark", "BTR 2GTHR", "Lottery", "Laguna Nights", and "Intuition".

=== Musical ===
Liz has stated that she felt she made more original sounding music when she went back and studied the artists that influenced her growing up, such as Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Max Martin, NSYNC, Aaliyah, Ashanti, Mýa and Craig David.

Other artists that influenced her are Britney Spears, Janet Jackson, Gwen Stefani, Kylie Minogue, Madonna, Robyn, Christina Aguilera, and Mariah Carey. Additionally, Liz says that Spears taught her "how to be a pop star".Japanese culture has been stated to have an effect on her music as well.
