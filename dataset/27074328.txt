She moved to South Korea three weeks later.Tiffany attended Korea Kent Foreign School and was trained at SM Entertainment for almost four years. She officially debuted as a member of South Korean girl group Girls' Generation in August 2007. The singer adopted the stage name Tiffany, the name her mother initially wanted to name her at birth. Besides Girls' Generation, Tiffany's early solo work mostly involved songs recorded for side projects and original soundtracks. Throughout her career, she also participated as the host for several television programs. In early 2008, Tiffany was diagnosed with vocal nodules and had to receive medical treatment. The symptoms relapsed in 2009 and 2010 in which the singer had to take a short break from her activities. Tiffany acknowledged her voice became "huskier" and "more mature" as a result.


=== 2012–2017: Girls’ Generation TTS, solo debut and controversy ===

In December 2011–January 2012, Tiffany debuted as a musical actress through a lead role in the Korean adaptation of musical Fame. She played the character Carmen Diaz, a performing arts student who "hopes to rise to stardom by working tirelessly on her craft". In April 2012, a Girls' Generation subgroup named TTS was formed with Tiffany and fellow members Taeyeon and Seohyun. Their debut EP, Twinkle, debuted at number one on the Gaon Album Chart and went on to become the eighth highest selling album of the year in South Korea with over 140,000 copies sold. The subgroup went on to release two more EPs: Holler (2014) and Dear Santa (2015). In November 2013, Tiffany participated as a contestant in the SBS' reality program Fashion King Korea – a program where South Korean celebrities team up with the nation's top designers to compete in fashion challenges and missions. The singer was paired with designer Ji Il-geun and finished the program in third place.During the summer of 2015, Tiffany began work on a solo record, with the mentality of it being the "transition into the next chapter of [her] music career." She participated in writing music since 2014, calling it "nerve-wrecking [sic] to put out music [she's] written on [her] own." Tiffany named Girls' Generation's Taeyeon as "a big part" that helped her throughout the preparation process for the album. The two singers have been known to be best friends since Tiffany's arrival in South Korea in 2004. The album, titled I Just Wanna Dance, was released in May 2016, making Tiffany the second Girls' Generation member to have a solo debut. Her album met with mixed but generally favorable reviews. Billboard's Tamar Herman called the album an "audible canvas to paint a new image for [Tiffany]", elaborating that it "showcases [her] range as an artist." The album, having a more American influence than typical K-pop, debuted at number three on both the Billboard World Albums Chart and South Korea's Gaon Album Chart. It sold 61,409 physical copies and was chosen by Billboard as the seventh best K-pop album of 2016. The lead single, and title track, "I Just Wanna Dance" debuted at number 10 on both the Billboard World Digital Songs Chart and the Gaon Digital Chart. In June 2016, the follow-up single "Heartbreak Hotel", featuring Simon Dominic, was released through SM Station digital music platform. To accompany her solo releases, Tiffany held a series of small concerts titled Weekend during the same month.

In August 2016 during the SMTown Live concert in Tokyo, Tiffany posted photos that involved use of the Japanese flag and Rising Sun Flag imagery to indicate her whereabouts on her social media accounts to interact with fans. Through there was no evidence of ill-intentions, this caused heavy criticism from the Korean public as the timing coincided with Korean Liberation Day, stirring a historical war wound sentiment. This event caused her to step down from Sister's Slam Dunk, a KBS2 variety show that she participated in at that time. Tiffany expressed regret for her actions in two handwritten apologies posted to her social media accounts, acknowledging her lack of history knowledge. After the controversial blunder, some media spoke out in defense of Tiffany, while others questioned the misogyny within Korean society, arguing that it can be "unforgiving" towards a female artist while a male counterpart would not receive the same treatment if the same event had occurred.In October 2016, Tiffany featured on the Far East Movement single "Don't Speak" for their Identity album. In an interview with Billboard, the hip-hop group said that working with Tiffany "really opened [their] eyes", commenting on "how versatile [Tiffany's] range is as a singer."
