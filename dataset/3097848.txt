== Early life ==
His friends gave him the name "DJ Magic" after watching him play on turntables. Mike only learned to deejay because his friend who was a DJ moved away from Louisiana so he felt he had to learn it all for himself. He later changed his name to "DJ Maj" to reflect that, as a Christian, he did not want to be associated with magic. He continued to DJ as a way of paying his way through technical college and soon perfected the art, using it as a means of bringing "holy hip-hop" to the mainstream audience.He signed a recording contract with Gotee Records and in 1999, released his debut mixtape album, Wax Museum: the Mixtape. The success of this album led to him collaborating with several Christian music stars in his following mixtapes and his debut album in 2005, BoogiRoot.
In 2002, Maj moved to the center of Christian Music, Nashville, Tennessee. He started a radio show to raise awareness of Christian urban music.In 2007, Maj released his third album, Speckled Goats II, a low-cost album ($7.99) with proceeds donated to hunger relief in third-world countries.In 2009, Maj produced the Gotee Hip Hope Hits Compilation.
