Marsh worked at DARP as an assistant to Dallas and Sheppard, engineering recordings for Natalie Cole, George Clinton, Joss Stone, Sugababes and Lionel Richie.Marsh steadily became in very heavy demand as more people became aware of his amazing talents as an engineer.

Marsh and CeeLo Green formed the production team The Grey Area to work on music that would be mainstream hits.  He collaborated on Gnarls Barkley's The Odd Couple and CeeLo's 2010 multi-platinum smash "Fuck You" from The Lady Killer album.
