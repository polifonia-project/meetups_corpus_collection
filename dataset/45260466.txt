== Early life and career ==
Ever since Carter was young, he had a passion for music. He was interested in R&B and old school rap. He played the drums in his middle school band and started to make beats in the eighth grade. He didn't play the drums in high school, because he didn't like their band. Soon after, he started to do his own thing in music. He started to take music more seriously after he graduated from Westside High school and went to college at The Art Institute. Carter's roommate was into making beats as well, and would spend more than five hours a day on the computer making beats. At first, Carter wanted to engineer and record for artists, but after seeing his roommates' work, it inspired him to start record producing.In 2011, Carter dropped out of college and started to engineer and record for people, but he wasn't making the kind of money that he wanted to. With no other job, he started to sell his beats. His cousin Yung Jonez, used to criticize his music. Just to impress his cousin, Carter kept trying to make his beats sounds better. As Yung Carter's beats started to improve, Yung Jonez started to like his music. They developed a music chemistry with each other. In May 2012, Carter sent rapper Rich Homie Quan eight beats to listen to. Rich Homie later told Carter on Instagram, that he made a song with one of the beats he sent him. The specific beat ended up being the song "All I Need" from the Still Goin In mixtape.It wasn't until Rich Homie sent him the track, that Carter was proud that his beats were being used. He also produced the "Investments" track from the same mixtape. He used a sample from a Luther Vandross song. Carter originally made the beat for Yung Jonez, but Jonez thought it was a good idea to send it to Rich Homie instead. In November, Carter made the beat to "Type Of Way" and sent it to Rich Homie. In December, Rich Homie Quan got back to him and it ended up being on the Still Goin In: Reloaded mixtape. Carter is often in Atlanta recording with different artists to get recognition and to make himself known in the music business.
