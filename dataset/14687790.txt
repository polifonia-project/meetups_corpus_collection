Zazula's record store in East Brunswick, New Jersey made him a central figure of the East Coast metal scene, regularly playing demo tapes sent to him through his underground tape-trading network which included the likes of Brian Slagel of Metal Blade Records, Ron Quintana (the editor of Metal Mania magazine), and producer Mark Whitaker. He was also somewhat of a mentor to Eddie Trunk.
