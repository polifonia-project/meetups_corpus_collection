Gwen was the youngest of five children, She began performing in local clubs as a teenager, and singing with local groups like the Lafayettes and the Independents. In 1963, she met a young sailor named George McCrae, whom she married within a week.From 1963, she recorded as a duo with her husband George; the couple received a solo recording contract, with Henry Stone's TK Records. The couple were discovered in 1967 by singer Betty Wright, who helped get them signed to Stone's Alston record label.Signed to TK subsidiary, Cat, as a solo artist, she found success on the U.S. R&B charts with her cover version of Bobby Bland's "Lead Me On" in 1970, followed by "For Your Love". Following husband George’s unexpected solo success with "Rock Your Baby", Gwen went on to have a major hit of her own in March 1975 with "Rockin' Chair", a #1 R&B hit which also reached number 9 in the United States' Billboard Hot 100. The follow-up "Love Insurance" also made the R&B chart (#16). Music critic Robert Christgau said "Rockin' Chair" is "almost as irresistibly Memphis-cum-disco-with-a-hook as hubby's 'Rock Your Baby.'"In 1972, she recorded the song "Always on My Mind". The song was later popularized by Elvis Presley and Willie Nelson, then also covered by many artists.
