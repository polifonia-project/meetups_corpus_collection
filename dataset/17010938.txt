Samuel Torres (born September 4, 1976) is a Colombian percussionist composer and arranger.  He was born in Bogotá, and started playing at age twelve and became involved with different bands in his hometown.  Torres' musician credits includes collaboration for 2013 Latin Grammy nominated Alejandro Sanz "La Música No Se Toca" (2013).

In 1999, Grammy Award winner Arturo Sandoval contracted Torres and toured with him for four years.  In 2000, Samuel Torres received the second place at the 2000 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition for Hand Percussion.
Throughout his career as a percussionist, Torres has performed with jazz artist Tito Puente, Chick Corea, Poncho Sanchez, Pete Escovedo, Dave Valentine, Michael Brecker, Don Byron, Claudio Roditi, Paquito D’Rivera, Caribbean Jazz Project, Jeff "Tain" Watts, Lila Downs, Candido Camero and Mike Stern among other great musicians.
