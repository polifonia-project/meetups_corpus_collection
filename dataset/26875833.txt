After majoring in Instrumental Jazz Performance at the University of South Florida, he was hired as guitarist/keyboardist for Atlantic recording artist Savatage.

Shortly after Oliva's death, Wes recorded a self-titled  instrumental acoustic guitar album (using his birth name Wesley Charlton Garren) dedicated to Criss's memory.
