Thomas Michael Coleman (born January 3, 1951) is an American bass player of bluegrass and folk music. He is best known for work with Doc Watson and the Seldom Scene.


== Biography ==


=== Doc Watson ===
Coleman grew up in Mayodan, North Carolina, graduating from Madison-Mayodan High School in 1969 where he was a part of bluegrass and folk groups. After working as a sound technician each time Doc Watson came to nearby Appalachian State University, Coleman played bass with Doc Watson and his son Merle starting in 1974 and continuing until 1986. Coleman also toured with Doc Watson and David Holt during the final three years of Doc's life.


=== Seldom Scene ===
After his time with Watson, Coleman joined the Seldom Scene, replacing Tom Gray. Coleman was with The Seldom Scene from 1986 until 1995. There were initial objections to Coleman's use of an electric bass in the normally acoustic bluegrass lineup, but Coleman's playing fit the group's sound.


=== Chesapeake ===
After leaving the Seldom Scene, Coleman joined Chesapeake with Moondi Klein, Mike Auldridge, and Jimmy Gaudreau. They released three albums on the Sugar Hill label. With no banjo, they were more acoustic country than bluegrass. Chesapeake disbanded in 1999 when their contract with Sugar Hill ended.


=== Sutton, Holt & Coleman ===
In 2013, Coleman recorded the album Ready for the Times with Bryan Sutton and David Holt. They recorded the album as a tribute to Doc Watson. The trio got together in 2011, and have performed frequently under the name Deep River Rising.


=== Pocket ===
Released in 2016, Pocket was Coleman's first album. Contributors included Alan Bibey, Sam Bush, Kelen Coleman, Jerry Douglas, Buddy Greene, Lamar Hill, David Holt, Rob Ickes, Jens Kruger, Jack Lawrence, Jeff Little, Pat McInerney, Stephen Mougin, Herb Pedersen, Allen Shadd, Bryan Sutton, Doc Watson, and Tony Williamson.


=== Awards ===
Projects that Coleman was involved with were nominated five times for a Grammy Award: once in 1982, twice in 1998, once in 1982, and once in 1994.


=== Personal life ===
Coleman is a videographer and film maker, known for his work on Children of Armageddon (2008), Broke: The New American Dream (2009), and Inside the Afghanistan War (2012). Coleman's daughter is actress Kelen Coleman.
