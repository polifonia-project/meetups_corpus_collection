Jimmy Drake (March 24, 1912 – July 24, 1968), known professionally as Nervous Norvus, was an American musician. He was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and lived for a few years in Ripley, Tennessee. Because of his chronic asthma condition, his family moved to California when he was seven, eventually settling in the East Hollywood, Los Angeles. When he was 29, he moved to Oakland, California, where he lived for the rest of his life.His novelty song "Transfusion" recorded for the Dot Records label was a Top 20 hit in May 1956, reaching #13 on Billboard's Hot 100 Chart.  A second single, "Ape Call," released in July of that year, also charted and peaked at #28. A third Dot single "The Fang" released in Sept 1956 did not chart at all.
In what may have been a career-limiting move, Drake refused an invitation to appear on and sing his hit song "Transfusion" on the Ed Sullivan TV Show, likely because of his shyness.
The lyrics in "Transfusion" concern a careless reckless driver who repeatedly receives blood transfusion after each accident, and promises each time to never speed again. This novelty song features the sound effects of a vehicle collision. The song was banned on many radio stations in the 1950s. The song was later played on the radio by Barry Hansen, which reportedly led to Hansen's nickname Dr. Demento.
After a brief solo career, which was less than six months, he concentrated on his demo service, providing music for other artists. He charged around seven dollars to make these demos, some of which led to publishing contracts for the songwriters.
Drake died at age 56 in Alameda County, California of cirrhosis of the liver. His body was donated to the University of California, San Francisco Anatomy Department.
