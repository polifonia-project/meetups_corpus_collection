== Biography ==
Jessy Wilson and Kallie North met through a photograph in 2013. Wilson, a Brooklyn native, came to Nashville looking for new opportunities to branch out as a singer-songwriter after having previously visited the city with her mentor John Legend, with whom she collaborated and toured as a backing vocalist. North, originally from Beaumont, Texas, worked as a photographer before deciding to pursue a career in music. Her photo of a juke joint piano served as the impetus for the Muddy Magnolias's formation after Jessy saw it on a Music Row desk. They were signed to I.R.S. Records but the label closed before they could release an album. Their sound has subsequently been described as "melding city grit and delta dirt".
