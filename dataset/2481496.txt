== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Krusen was born in Tacoma, Washington and grew up in the town of Gig Harbor along with his two brothers and sister. He was into Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry when he was young, and later got into The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Police, and Neil Young. Krusen began playing locally in the Seattle area in 1979 while he was in high school. His first band, Outrigger, was formed with his friends from high school. Throughout the 1980s, Krusen had several stints playing with Seattle area musical acts, including Boibs, Agent Boy, Gary Williams, Tramps of Panic, Liar's Club, Hard Time, and WarmDrive.


=== Pearl Jam ===

Krusen was recruited in 1990 by bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard to be the drummer for Pearl Jam. Krusen was asked to join Pearl Jam after auditioning with the band. Krusen was the first full-time drummer for Pearl Jam, replacing Matt Cameron. Cameron was unable to fully commit to Pearl Jam due to playing full-time in Soundgarden. Krusen played with Pearl Jam through to the completion of the band's debut album, Ten in 1991. After the recording sessions for Ten were completed, Krusen left Pearl Jam in May 1991 and checked himself into rehabilitation. According to Krusen, he was suffering from personal problems at the time, including alcoholism. Krusen said, "It was a great experience. I felt from the beginning of that band that it was something special," and added, "They had to let me go. I couldn't stop drinking, and it was causing problems. They gave me many chances, but I couldn't get it together." Vocalist Eddie Vedder said, "Krusen was a real hero...He was going through a lot, but he had something really special." Krusen was replaced by Dave Abbruzzese.


=== Hovercraft ===

In the mid-1990s, Krusen joined Beth Liebling and Ryan Shinn in the band Hovercraft under the stage name "Karl 3â€’30". Krusen replaced previous drummer Eddie Vedder. With a more technically proficient drummer, the band was now free to play beyond the lo-fidelity noise experiments of its debut release, and play proper shows with structured improvisation and avant experimentalism. While as a member of Hovercraft, Krusen toured with the band and recorded the album Akathisia (1997).


=== Diamond Star Halo ===
In 1994 Krusen co-founded Diamond Star Halo with former Candlebox bass player Aaron Seravo. The two were introduced by a mutual friend and discovered they had exactly the same vision for a band. The band was completed by Singer Bo Bligh and bassist Steve Martin the band released their first record in 1995 tilted In The Rough on Regal Recordings. The album was produced by Cristopher Thorne of Blind Melon and Kevin Martin of Candlebox & was mixed by Kelly Grey. The band enjoyed moderate success but not to the level of their former bands Candlebox and Pearl Jam.
After much conflict centering on singer Bo Bligh's drug addictions the band dissolved. There was a later version of the band reformed by Seravo in 2000.  Aaron Seravo died of cancer January 9, 2011, surrounded by friends and loved ones, at Stanford University Hospital.  Steve Martin died very early in 2011 as well (committing suicide) a few days before Seravo's passing.

After the first plan to carry on Blind Melon with a new singer didn't work out, Smith and Thorn decided to start a new band and came across vocalist Chris Shinn after moving to Los Angeles. Krusen was already friends with Thorn and Smith. While working on tracks for a second album, delays set the band back, and Krusen grew somewhat frustrated and left. This eventually led to Unified Theory's break-up.
