== History ==
Movshon began his career as a teenager playing in the band The Mighty Imperials with longtime collaborators Leon Michels, Homer Steinweiss, and Thomas Brenneck. The band released music on Desco Records, a predecessor of seminal soul labels Daptone and Soul Fire, and soon was working as songwriters and sessions musicians for the latter. He joined Brooklyn Afrobeat ensemble Antibalas in the early 2000s and was soon a member of Michels' El Michels Affair and Brenneck's Menahan Street Band. Among other soul and funk bands affiliated with Truth & Soul Records and Daptone Records, Movshon is also a longtime member of Lee Field & The Expressions and has played with Charles Bradley and Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings.
While sitting in with The Dap-Kings in the 2000s, Movshon got to know Mark Ronson who was producing Amy Winehouse's record Back to Black with the group. He played bass on much of the record and would go on play on many other Mark Ronson productions since, often forming a rhythm section with Steinweiss. In 2010, Movshon and Michels toured with The Black Keys. A few years later, they joined Dan Auerbach along with Steinweiss and Richard Swift to form The Arcs; The Arcs released their album Yours, Dreamily, in 2015. Over the past two decades, Movshon has also played with artists like Brooklyn art-rockers TV on the Radio and hip-hop group The Wu Tang Clan.
In 2014, Movshon built the Long Island City recording studio The Diamond Mine with Brenneck, Michels, and Steinweiss.The bass he is mostly known for using is a vintage Gibson Ripper. 
Movshon lives in New York City.
