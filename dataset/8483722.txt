== Biography ==
Christopher Paul Jones was born in Reno, Nevada. At the age of five, he began playing the guitar. A few years later, he decided to become a professional musician, and when he was 11 years old, he was admitted to a program at the Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore, Maryland. There he discovered Johann Sebastian Bach, to whom he dedicated his student composition "Sonata in D", and for which Jones was awarded the conservatory's "Young Composer of the Year" award.Shortly thereafter, he discovered the blues and started listening to Robert Johnson, James Taylor, and Little Feat.
In 1976, Jones joined the U.S. Army and was stationed in Adenine's, Germany. During this time, the foundation for his musical career in Europe was laid. Over the following decades, he played guitar on albums of artists such as Sara K., Allan Taylor, and Reinhard Mey. He toured and recorded solo and with the blues harmonica musician Steve Baker.
In August 2005, Jones was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in an advanced stage. He died on September 13, 2005 in Northeim, Germany. Many friends and other musicians helped him, either personally or by staging charity concerts to help with his expenses.
