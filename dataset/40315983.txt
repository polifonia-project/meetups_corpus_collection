== Career ==
Tafjord is a graduate of Norges Musikkhøgskole i Oslo. After many years as participant of the Kringkastingsorkesteret, he started as a freelance jazz and studio musician. Tafjord has developed a very unconventional style of playing as improviser, which has had an influence on composers and others musicians, to be more aware of the tuba as instrument.
He has toured with several international orchestras and groups, such as the Scandinavian Tuba Jazz Inc. and Carla Bley Scandinavian Jazz Ensemble. He has worked with the singer and actress Elisabeth Lindland in several different contexts.
