Robert Roy Marlette (born December 7, 1955) is an American record producer, recording engineer, mixer, and songwriter. His production, writing and mixing credits include David Lee Roth, Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, Rob Zombie, Sebastian Bach, Rob Halford, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Atreyu, and Ill Niño.


== Career ==
Marlette started out as a session musician and the first album he appeared on was Al Stewart's 24 Carrots. He has then worked as a musician, mainly as keyboarder and pianist, and composer for numerous artists including Tracy Chapman, John Wetton, Laura Branigan, Alice Cooper, Krokus and The Storm.
In 1994 he produced Red Square Black's Square EP, his first collaboration with John 5, which would be followed by David Lee Roth's album DLR Band, 2wo (industrial metal project of John 5 and Rob Halford), the mixing of the UK bonus CD of Marilyn Manson's The Last Tour on Earth and Loser. In the late 1990s besides Rob Halford he started producing other big hard rock names like Black Sabbath and Tony Iommi, and Quiet Riot.
In the new millennium he became famous for producing hit-records for post-grunge and alternative metal bands like Saliva, Shinedown, Seether and Filter, and metalcore band Atreyu, but also more traditional hard rock bands like Black Stone Cherry, Bleeker Ridge, Airbourne, Sebastian Bach, and Alice Cooper.
In 2011 he also produced heavy metal band Anvil's new album Juggernaut of Justice, their first album after the documentary Anvil! The Story of Anvil.
He is a regular at Monnow Valley Studio in Rockfield, Monmouthshire.
