Blue Meanies were an American ska-core band founded in Carbondale, Illinois, at Southern Illinois University, in 1989.


== Independent years ==
The band made their recording debut in 1991 with the release of their first single, "Grandma Shampoo" c/w "Dickory Dock". Although their personnel was continuously changing, The Blue Meanies' sound would remain consistent throughout their first four albums, Peace Love Groove (1991), Pave The World (1992), Kiss Your Ass Goodbye (1995), Full Throttle (1997), and the live record Sonic Documentation Of Exhibition And Banter (1998).


== MCA records era ==
The band signed with MCA Records towards the end of the commercially successful third wave of ska, with a line-up consisting of John Paul Camp (III) (saxophone/ vocals), Sean Dolan (guitar), Jimmy Flame (trumpet/ vocals), Chaz Linde (keyboard/ vocal), Dave Lund (bass/ vocals), Billy Spunke (vocals/ megaphone), and Bob Trondson (drums). By this time, a total of twenty-two musicians had passed through the band since their formation, including Jay Vance, as a bass player, who went on to form the one-man metal band Captured! By Robots. 
Their sixth full-length album, The Post Wave, released in late 2000 on MCA Records, was the most musically different from their other five albums. In 2001, the band regained the rights to The Post Wave and reissued it on Thick Records, their original record label.
The band ceased touring, though they never issued an official break-up statement.


== Post-breakup ==
In the summer of 2004, it was confirmed that the Blue Meanies would temporarily revive the old tradition of the Winter Nationals. For years the Blue Meanies would have a show on December 23 in their hometown of Chicago. On December 22, 2004 the band played its first show in three years at Double Door with The Tossers and Cougars supporting. The next day the band played an all ages show at The Metro with Mu330, The Methadones, and New Black supporting. The Metro show was filmed with multiple cameras but no plans for a release of the footage have been announced.
On August 16, 2006 it was announced that the Blue Meanies would reunite for Riot Fest 2006, an annual punk rock festival held in Chicago. Other high-profile reunions for the fest include Naked Raygun and The Bollweevils.
Since April 24, 2006, the band (primarily Sean Dolan) has kept somewhat in contact with their fanbase with their MySpace profile. On it, they have provided previously unreleased tracks (any songs pulled from the site can be obtained via email), largely from the recording sessions of The Post Wave.
On May 13, 2014, the organizers of Riot Fest and Blue Meanies revealed that the band will reunite and perform at the Chicago version of the 2014 festival.
