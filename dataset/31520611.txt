In retirement she turned to teaching. Her students included the Danish baritone Frantz Rabinowitz (1918–1948).In 1943, when Italy came under Nazi occupation and Jews were being hunted, Finzi-Magrini who was of Jewish origin went into hiding under a false name. In 1944 a young nephew was deported to a concentration camp, causing a heart attack that left her mute and paralyzed. She died six weeks later from wounds received in an American air-raid on Desio.
