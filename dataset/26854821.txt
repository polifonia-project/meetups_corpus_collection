== Embezzlement conviction ==
According to court documents, in May 2016, DiMaggio was originally contacted by a nonprofit org registered in Bulgaria to recreate a "Live Aid" style charity concert in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia to raise money for the homeless and displaced children of the wars in conflict zones worldwide.DiMaggio offered to contract and obtain talent for the event that was set for October 2016. Not long before the event was scheduled to take place, many in the Bulgarian foundation had doubts about the promised "galaxy of stars" including Mick Jagger to the city of Sofia for a big charity concert and people suspected early on that it was all just a big hoax.On August 5, 2016, the promoter wired $750,000.00 dollars to an account controlled by DiMaggio, who had withdrawn the money four days later. DiMaggio during a press conference said he had received "verbal confirmations" concerning participation from Johnny Depp, Mick Jagger, Bruno Mars, Justin Timberlake, Rod Stewart, the band Earth, Wind and Fire, and others. Court records show that DiMaggio took the money, provided to him to escrow to secure the talent and used it as his own.
DiMaggio used the money to support his lifestyle and purchase a home for his wife. More money was spent on a Volvo ($35,209), another purchase of an auto for $24,000.00, over $15,000.00 in credit card payments as well as $53,821.91 in debit card and cash totaling over $37k. He also transferred $150,000 to the bank account of his company, DiMagic Entertainment Inc. None of the money was sent to the artists DiMaggio promised to book. The sponsor of the charity event sued DiMaggio in Los Angeles Superior Court.Prior to his arrest and upon receiving a request from his victim for a refund, DiMaggio told the foundation the money had been delivered to musicians, although bankruptcy court records showed he had simply used the money as his own. Once confronted he told the victims that he was "Moving to Paris" his birthplace, presumably to avoid criminal prosecution. DiMaggio was found to have forged bank documents as well as deleted his correspondence during civil litigation and also filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in an attempt to delay justice.DiMaggio on September 25, 2019, was criminally convicted with his guilty plea to the charges that he embezzled over $750,000.00 from a charity for homeless children, a Bulgarian-based non-profit.  The "Peace for You Peace for Me Foundation". On September 25, 2019, DiMaggio pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to 27 months federal prison time and 1 year home confinement. He had faced a 20 year federal prison sentence.The case had previously been heard in a civil bankruptcy court where DiMaggio admitted he bought his ex-wife's home with the money. The 'Peace for You Peace for Me Foundation' was awarded a $1.2 million award in Mr. DiMaggio's bankruptcy court case.
