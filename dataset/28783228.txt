In the following years, he played with the Dollar Brand Quintet which included Don Cherry. As a side-man, Jædig was constantly in demand and worked with such musicians as Tete Montoliu, Jimmy Woode, Philly Joe Jones/Dizzy Reece, and Louis Hjulmand. Jædig recorded his first album as sole leader, Danish Jazzman, in 1967 with Axen, Botschinsky, Dusko Goykovich, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen and Alex Riel. He later formed his own trio included bass player Hugo Rasmussen and drummer Kresten Osgood. In a duo with pianist Carsten Dahl, Jædig recorded live shows in 2002 which later were compiled for a release from Timeless Records.
In the 1970s and 1980s Jædig worked with Wild Bill Davison, Art Farmer, Stan Getz, in the Thad Jones Big Band (Live at Montmartre, 1978), also with Duke Jordan, Horace Parlan (Arrival, 1973), Sahib Shihab (Orgy in Rhythm), and in Ernie Wilkins Almost Big Band.

== Reception ==
Kjeld Frandsen, a music critic and journalist from Denmark's Berlingske Tidende mentioned Bent Jædig's influence on Danish Jazz scene for years, in an article published in DanishMusic.Info in January 2008.
Music journalist Kjeld Frandsen wrote: "A Danish tenor saxophonist who was of immeasurable importance to the Danish jazz scene died in the summer of 2004; bebop veteran Bent Jædig. Young musicians flocked around him, learning from his style and his indomitable approach to the music, and it was widely held that an evening on stage with Bent Jædig was worth more than a whole semester at the Conservatory." (The Danish Jazz Scene: "Rich in activities – In Touch With the Whole World", Kjeld Frandsen)
