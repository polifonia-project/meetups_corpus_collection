== Early life ==
From 2007–2011, Byrne formed several bands, among them, Pop Punk band called Mr Lightweight, and 'Moses Moorhouse and the Dinosaur Palace'. A desire to pursue music beyond these ventures led Byrne to audition for The Voice of Ireland.Byrne has come a long way since winning the inaugural season of “The Voice of Ireland”.  “The Voice” was a learning experience, that included both highs and lows. Making an album in 3 months meant writing new songs with some talented people, but also, in some ways, compromising on the art Byrne wanted to create. After the initial roar, things went back to normal and Byrne continued gigging around Ireland, UK and Europe; however, with a new sense of confidence.

=== 2012: The Voice of Ireland ===
Byrne entered The Voice of Ireland in 2011, singing Bruce Springsteen's "The River" at the blind auditions. All four coaches turned around but Byrne ultimately chose Niall "Bressie" Breslin as his coach. During the battle rounds, Byrne was pitted against Dara Molloy; they sang "If It Makes You Happy" after which Bressie decided to send Byrne through to the live shows. For the first live show, Byrne sang "You Do Something to Me" and was saved by the public vote. In week three, he sang "Are You Gonna Be My Girl" and was safe. For the fifth live show Byrne sang "The Day We Caught the Train" and was sent through to the quarter final by public vote. Before the final, his version of "What a Wonderful World" topped the iTunes charts in Ireland. Louis Walsh said he could crack America. On 29 April 2012, Byrne was crowned the winner of the first series.
