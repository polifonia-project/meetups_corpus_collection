== Sound ==
Jesus Freak Hideout says his style "nearly echoes the sound of Jason Mraz". Christian Manifesto says "Armed with a guitar and a clear message, his music is easily identifiable as that 'safe' genre 'acoustic pop'. But, at least, it is stellar acoustic pop, this time." His sound has been compared to Dave Barnes, Bebo Norman, John Mayer, and Brandon Heath.
