Ramel Leroy Gill, (born October 18, 1973) better known by his stage name Black Child, is an American rapper from Queens, New York City. He is best known as being an associate of Ja Rule, Irv Gotti, Cadillac Tah, Chris Gotti and the Murder Inc Records crew. He appeared on hit singles with Ja Rule, such as "Murda 4 Life" with Memphis Bleek and various songs with Ja Rule and other members of Murder Inc.


== Early life ==
Gill was born in Brooklyn, New York. His family moved to Queens when he was young. During his childhood years, one of family friends wrote verses for him at the age of 11. While Gill was spitting rhymes in his neighborhood, he began to write some of his own rhymes to use that motivation from his family and friends.  Learning his ways of life, he had a few run-ins with the law, doing time in jail for a gun case that lasted only 30 months, while after being signed by Jam Master Jay Records (now defunct after Jay's death in 2002) in 1993, which was a label owned by the late DJ Jam Master Jay. Before that, he was already making songs with a few other aspiring upcoming artists who were trying to make a name for themselves, including Irv Gotti who was under the moniker DJ Irv (whose Gill was around at that time) produced "Can I Live" for Jay-Z off the Reasonable Doubt album and Ja Rule with "Cash Money Click" featuring Nemesis and Chris Black. While being incarcerated, he began to write rhymes, joining freestyle battles and showing his unique talent to infiltrate the rap world. After spending a few years in jail, Gill reached out to Ja Rule, showing him his lyrical ability to prove himself as a rapper which Ja Rule liked and accepted him to sign with Murder Inc after being released from Jam Master Jay Records due to a gun charge.


== Feud with 50 Cent ==
Black Child has also been involved in the Murder Inc. and G-Unit feud, where he, Ja Rule, and other Murder Inc. associates had an altercation with 50 Cent, Tony Yayo, and G-Unit associates at The Hit Factory in New York City, March 2000. Black Child admitted that he stabbed 50 Cent, saying it was in self defense and 50 was the one reaching for a gun. He released a diss song called "The Real Wanksta" which attacked 50 Cent labeling him as an informant, which Black Child claims that 50 Cent had filed an order of protection on Murder Inc.
