The video received over 2 million hits on YouTube and received positive reviews from music critics. In a review for The Guardian, Michael Cragg felt that the song creates a "fresh take on 70s disco and filtered house with a dash of funk. But while Hercules & Love Affair sound like they now lack a distinctive vocalist, Jessica 6 are elevated by Ruiz's smoky, melancholic voice." Likewise, Robin Murray of Clash noticed a "definite pop touch, but that doesn’t discredit some fantastic production." The album's critical acclaim further solidified her status as a history making global artist, at the Greek MAD Video Music Awards on 14 June 2011, Berlin’s Tempodrom, London’s prestigious Royal Albert Hall, Tate Modern and making an appearance at Chile’s Vina del Mar Festival where she appeared with Academy Award nominated actress Daniela Vega.
