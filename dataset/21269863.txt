== Personal life ==
Bell grew up in a musical family and began playing music at home. She played clarinet in the Plainfield High School band and performed in an a cappella trio from age ten through her last year of high school.

In the late 1970s, Bell moved to California and worked at a restaurant in Sausalito. While singing "Happy Birthday" to a customer, she was heard by jazz guitarist Eddie Duran, and he invited her to sing with his band. They made a demo tape which became her first album, Let There Be Love (Concord Jazz), recorded with Duran and Stan Getz. They recorded another album for Concord Jazz, this time with Tom Harrell.Bell recorded a third album, Sagacious Grace in 1990 with Houston Person and John Stowell, but technical problems during recording kept the album from being released. She left the music business and became a grade school music teacher in Mill Valley. In 2011 audio engineers fixed the problems with Sagacious Grace and the album was released by Laser Records. It reached No. 31 on the JazzWeek radio chart.
