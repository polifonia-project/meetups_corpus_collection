At age sixteen, he attended a Paul Overstreet concert; while at the concert, Overstreet gave McComas the address of his publishing company. McComas submitted a demo tape to the publishing company, who then encouraged him to continue working on his writing skills.McComas later attended college, but soon dropped out to move to Nashville, Tennessee. He briefly signed with Mercury Records, before he landed a deal with Lyric Street in 2001, charting the singles "Night Disappear With You" and "I Could Never Love You Enough." In 2003, he landed his first Top 10, "99.9% Sure (I've Never Been Here Before)" and the follow-up "You're in My Head", a No. 21 hit on the country charts.
