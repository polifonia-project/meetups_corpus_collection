Richard Sanders (born 8 December 1952) is an English violinist who has played in jazz-rock, folk rock, British folk rock and folk groups, including Soft Machine and Fairport Convention.


== Biography ==
Sanders' first experience with a professional band was in the summer of 1972, touring Europe with classical/rock percussionist Stomu Yamash'ta's Red Buddha Theatre. He later went on to play with jazz pianists Johnny Patrick and Michael Garrick. In the late 1970s, he briefly toured as a member of the jazz-rock group Soft Machine and followed with a stint in The Albion Band. In 1981, he co-founded a recording studio, Morgreen Studios, with which he remained active for a few years.  In 1984, he joined Fairport Convention and recorded his first album with them, Gladys' Leap, the following year. Since 2002, in addition to his work with Fairport, he has also been working regularly with his trio, known as the Ric Sanders Trio, which features Vo Fletcher on guitar and Michael Gregory on drums and percussion.
