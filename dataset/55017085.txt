== Early years ==
Born Edith Josephine Denning in Orlinda, Tennessee as one of eleven children on a family farm, her goal was to become a high school teacher and basketball coach, given she played the sport in high school. Because of the Great Depression and World War II, Denning had to get a job and save money to go to college. During World War II, she worked in the salvage department at the Vultee Aircraft plant in Nashville during the day, while going to the Watkins Institute (now part of Belmont University) for night school to learn how to be a secretary. Denning later attended Peabody College in Nashville (now part of Vanderbilt University) and Lambuth College in Jackson, Tennessee (now part of the University of Memphis).


== Work with the CMA ==
When the CMA was formed in 1958, Denning (then known as Jo Walker) was hired as the first full-time employee to do secretarial duties for the first Executive Director Harry Stone, a former manager for WSM AM radio in Nashville. Stone stayed in the position of executive director until 1960. Prior to her hiring with the CMA, Walker had never visited the Grand Ole Opry.In a meeting on who to replace Stone as CMA's executive director, CMA member and country comedian Minnie Pearl stated, "Jo's doing all the work. Why don't we just hire her?" (Walker was not in attendance at the meeting when Pearl made the comments.) Walker took the position in 1962.In the late 1950s, there were only 81 full-time country music radio stations in the United States. Walker's efforts during her tenure was to increase the number of radio stations in the US, which increased to over 2,400 by the time of her retirement, when she was known as Jo Walker-Meador. Other country music-related items established under Walker during the 1960s were the first Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, with a national fundraising drive that helped complete the physical museum in 1967 (the Hall of Fame itself was established six years earlier), and the creation of the CMA Awards in 1967. In 1972, she helped establish Fan Fair (now the CMA Music Festival) for country music fans worldwide to meet their favorite stars in Nashville.When Walker-Meador retired in 1991, she was honored at a retirement banquet of more than 1,000 attendees that included future Country Music Hall of Fame inductees Garth Brooks (2012) and Brenda Lee (1997).
