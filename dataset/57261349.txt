== Early life ==
Anđelković, a Vučje native, showed interest in music at a very young age, thus in his early youth started learning to play the piano and harmonica. Gaining the ability to play it at a semi-professional level at the Belgrade music school, at 16 years of age, he participated in the first season of Zvezde Granda, where he reached second place, amassing popularity across Serbia.In 2010, he starred as Perhan in the rendition of the cult Serbian film of Serbian-Bosnian artist Emir Kusturica, Dom za vešanje, who was previously played by Davor Dujmović. He performed alongside Milica Todorović, who interpreted Azra, whose character was played in the original by Sinolička Trpkova. The musical interpretation gained massive acclaim due to the new elements it blended in to the movie classic.
Anđelković resides in Belgrade, and is close friends with co-star Milica Todorović.

One of his more notable projects was in late 2017, when he was a contestant in the fourth season of Tvoje lice zvuči poznato, the Serbian version of Your Face Sounds Familiar.
