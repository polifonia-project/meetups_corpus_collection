== Music ==
Wilcox attended The Evergreen State College where she studied film and worked with Tobi Vail at a sandwich shop. During this time she and friends Kathleen Hanna and Vail collaborated on a feminist zine titled Bikini Kill. The three women enlisted guitarist Billy Karren and began a feminist punk band also called Bikini Kill. Wilcox provided bass, guitar, drums, and vocals for the band, which lasted throughout the '90s and is considered one of the definitive bands of the riot grrrl movement. Wilcox's other musical projects include the Frumpies with Vail, Karren, Michelle Mae (The Make-Up), and Molly Neumann (Bratmobile);  The Casual Dots with Christina Billotte (Slant 6, Quixotic) and Steve Dore; and The Julie Ruin with Hanna, Kenny Mellman (Kiki & Herb), Carmine Covelli, and Sara Landeau.
Wilcox collaborated with Fugazi's Brendan Canty on the theme song to the punk rock-oriented children's show Pancake Mountain.


== Personal life ==
Wilcox married musician Guy Picciotto from Fugazi, and as of September 2020 the two were living in Brooklyn with their 14 year-old.
