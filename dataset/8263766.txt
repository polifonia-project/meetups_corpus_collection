She knows how to speak four languages, including Persian, Japanese, English and Spanish.May J.'s Iranian mother refused to acknowledge her Persian roots due to perceived negativity towards Iranians in Japan and May J. grew up forbidden to speak the Persian language. Believing she was American, she discovered her true identity on a chance overhearing of a conversation between her mother and grandmother. During her formative middle school years she began listening to Iranian singers Googoosh and Afshin and has later said she hopes to debut in Iran.At the age of 14, May J. was successful at a Sony Music Japan audition and soon signed onto Sony Music.
