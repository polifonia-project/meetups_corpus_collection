== Early life ==
Nilssen-Love was born in Molde, Norway. His parents ran a jazz club in Stavanger, and he learned to play drums on the kit owned by his father. As a teenager, he played with free-jazz reedsman Frode Gjerstad, which was the start of a long musical relationship. He did musical studies at Sund folkehøgskole 1993-94. In 1994, during studies on the Jazz program at the Trondheim Musikkonservatorium (1994–96), he formed the band Element which musically became a platform for several other groups with bassist Ingebrigt Håker Flaten and pianist Håvard Wiik and led to collaborations with Iain Ballamy and Chris Potter. Nilssen-Love also did a little composing in the mid-1990s.
