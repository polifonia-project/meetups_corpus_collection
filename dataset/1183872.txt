Michel Colombier (23 May 1939 – 14 November 2004) was a French composer, arranger, and conductor.


== Career ==
Colombier wrote the scores of several motion pictures and TV productions. He also wrote chamber music and ballets. With composer Pierre Henry he wrote music for Messe pour le temps présent, a piece created by choreographer Maurice Béjart in 1967. He released an album on A&M Records, "Wings", in 1971, which included a collaboration with Lani Hall on lead vocal, his song "We Could Be Flying, with lyrics by Paul Williams. Recorded in Paris, with Colombier on piano, it was also included on the album "Sun Down Lady", Lani Halls' first solo album after her years as lead singer for Sergio Mendes and Brazil 66,  released in 1972 on A&M Records.
The piece of music for which Colombier was perhaps, most famous, was the piece Emmanuel, named after and written in memory of his young son, who died in his infancy.  It was used by the French television channel Antenne 2, alongside an 80 second animation known as Les Hommes Volants (The Flying Men), by Jean Michel Folon, to signal the beginning and end of their broadcast day between the years of 1975 and 1983.
