Prager started rapping while at school and eventually recorded a track called "I Woulda", which was inspired by her cousin's gang-related death in the U.S.. The track received heavy rotation and was the start of Prager's career as a recording artist. When she was 19, she sent a demo of her music to UK artist Estelle, who invited her to New York City to record the song "Hey Girl" featuring John Legend, as well as "Don't Talk", another track for Estelle's d√©but album The 18th Day, which was certified gold in the UK. Baby Blue was also featured rapping in the video for the top 20 Estelle hit "1980".Later that year, Blue released the mixtape Out of the Blue Vol. I (with Volume II released two years later) which featured Estelle, members of So Solid Crew, Shystie, Sway, and Akala.
