== Praise for Brian Landus ==
The Boston Globe reviewer of his 2011 album Capsule wrote that the album, "which includes pianist Michael Cain (mostly on Fender Rhodes), guitar Nir Felder, bassist Matthew Parish, and drummer Rudy Royston, makes an organic fusion that ignores the boundaries that supposedly separate jazz, rock, pop, and R&B". His 2015 album The Deep Below was described by The New York Times as "a sonic register: low and deep, Mr. Landrus's natural range on baritone saxophone, bass saxophone, bass flute and bass clarinet".
