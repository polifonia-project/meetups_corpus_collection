Bernstein did his first score for the 1969 Oscar-winning documentary, Czechoslovakia 1968.  According to Bernstein, "I met the director, Denis Sanders, through friends at UCLA. It was a brilliant film, and I convinced Denis that I knew what sort of music would tell the story of the Russian invasion of its smaller neighbor. The film was unusual because it had no spoken words, only music and occasional sound effects to tell the story."His first Hollywood score was for the United Artists film, White Lightning (1973), starring Burt Reynolds.  The film marked the first of many collaborations between Bernstein and director Joseph Sargent.  Bernstein also scored the sequel to the film, Gator (1976).

(1977), Outlaw Blues (1977) and Love at First Bite (1979).

=== A Nightmare on Elm Street ===
Under the recommendation of his agent, Bernstein met with Wes Craven and was hired to score his film, A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984).  On working with Craven: "Wes was easy to work with, he gave me a lot of freedom, but we could discuss ideas and approaches. In many ways he was an ideal director to communicate with because he listened well and was open to all ideas."  Bernstein used an electric score since the film was low budget.Bernstein did not return to score the music for the other films in the franchise, though Renny Harlin briefly talked to him about scoring the fourth film.
