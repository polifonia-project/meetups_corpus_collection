== Biography ==
Matteo Zingales was born on 28 October 1980 in Rome and raised in Sydney. He graduated in 2004 from the Australian Film, Television and Radio School with a Masters in Screen Composition. Zingales has cited Thomas Newman, John Barry and Arvo Pärt as his most important musical influences. "When I was nine," he recalls, "I adored movies. I wanted to be a director and then I realised what actually moved me was the music. I just used to sit down at the piano and write".He has worked across a variety of music platforms. His television credits include the music for over 200 episodes of the series, All Saints (2004–2009), broadcast in fifteen countries, and for all 22 episodes of the first series of Winners & Losers (2011), broadcast in four countries.
He has composed the music for feature films, including collaborating on The Hunter (2011), which starred Willem Dafoe and Sam Neill, and on Not Suitable for Children (2012), which was directed by Peter Templeman and starred Ryan Kwanten (True Blood) and Sarah Snook; for television mini-series including the ABC's Devil's Dust (2012), one of the six parts of the ABC's Redfern Now (2012), and SBS's Better Man (2013); and for short films, such as Blue Poles (2004), starring Sam Worthington. His documentary credits include Lachlan Macquarie: The Father of Australia (2011) for BBC Scotland and The History Channel; and he has composed music for television advertisements.
In February 2008 the Sydney Morning Herald's Mark Chipperfield included Zingales as one of Australia’s top thirteen "new talents breaking ground in their chosen fields".He is a co-founder and director of Sonar Music, the leading Australian music composers' collective.
