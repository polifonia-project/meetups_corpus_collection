== Personal life ==
Lee was diagnosed with Moyamoya disease in late 2015. After undergoing two brain surgeries, she briefly lost language and comprehension skills. Once these were regained, Lee eventually began work on her 2017 album Lune Rouge, despite not being able to fully understand music. She has noted that this album was her most personal piece of work due to the difficulties she experienced prior to making it.She discusses surmounting these challenges in Vox's Netflix series, Explained (season 1, episode 20) and the Great Big Story miniseries Soundwave.
