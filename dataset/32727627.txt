== Critical reception ==
Gramophone in a review of Hale singing "Devil's Eyes" stated that it was "gorge for those who enjoy the more extravagantly passionate singers." A different reviewer for Gramophone, in a review of Hale singing "The Bandit", stated that they'd "like him much better if he didn't indulge so much in tasteless exaggeration and think that everyone listened to his records about ten miles from their gramophones." A Gramophone review of "Blowing Wild" stated that it was "more for those 'teen age maidens who swoon every time they hear a voice that has what to them is sex appeal. To me it's just rather tasteless extravagance." In 1952, Gramophone reviewed Hale's double-sided single that featured Hale singing "Anytime" and "Weaver of Dreams". For "Anytime", the reviewer stated that it was a "bouncy number" that was "more pleasant to the ear" than other vocalists had done. However, the reviewer stated that "Weaver of Dreams" had a lot of "weary notes" that sounded like he was "sing[ing] through his nose."


== Personal life ==
Hale was married to Santina Motta in 1946 and had two sons, Paul Dennis Hoare and Robert Norman Hoare (Hale).
