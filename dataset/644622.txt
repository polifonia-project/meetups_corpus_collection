Many Chinese, when asked, say they associate the song with the need to finish their activity or business and go home (although they may not even know the name of the song or its artist).


== Criticism ==
Kenny G has attracted significant criticism from mainstream jazz musicians and enthusiasts. Pat Metheny found him "not really an advanced player, even [among pop-oriented sax players of that time]," adding that, according to his opinion, Kenny G had "major rhythmic problems" and his "harmonic and melodic vocabulary was extremely limited, mostly to pentatonic-based and blues-lick derived patterns". Metheny stated that the "controversy" that has surrounded Kenny G "among musicians and serious listeners" is due to the fact that "he sells an enormous amount of records while not being anywhere near a really great player in relation to the standards that have been set on his instrument over the past sixty or seventy years".  Saxophonist, composer, and bandleader Branford Marsalis, stating that he's refusing to ‚Äúfight that silly war between jazz and smooth jazz," called on G's critics as follows: "When all these jazz guys get in a tizzy over Kenny G, they need to leave Kenny alone. He's not stealing jazz. The audience he has wouldn't be caught dead at a real jazz concert or club. It's not like some guy says, 'You know, I used to listen to Miles, Trane and Ornette. And then I heard Kenny G, and I never put on another Miles record.' It's a completely different audience."Kenny G's 1999 single "What a Wonderful World" was particularly criticized for its overdubbing of Louis Armstrong's recording of the same song. Mark Sabbatini found G's cover to be an "unconscionable act of auditory graffiti" over the Armstrong song. The New York Times'  Ben Ratliff opined that a recording by Armstrong, known especially for improvisation, should not be altered by a musician "whose range and depth of understanding was already in question." Alto saxophonist Charles McPherson expressed "mixed feelings," stating that Kenny G's "audience probably does not know Armstrong or Getz or Charlie Parker. So, if he feels like his audience should be more familiar with those people, I can‚Äôt see anything aesthetically wrong with that." On the other hand, pianist Fred Hersch, commenting on the occasion of that cover track, said that Kenny G is "not a jazz musician."Critic Josef Woodard found Kenny G serving "a noble purpose by offering musicians a paradigm of what not to do," in a JazzTimes poll in which, though, players such as Stan Kenton, Maynard Ferguson, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Ornette Coleman were characterized as "over rated."In 2021, HBO Max started streaming director Penny Lane's documentary Listening to Kenny G, with the subject of the film not having had any control over its content. Lane stated she chose Kenny Gorelick as her subject because he is "a musician who is objectively popular, by way of record sales, but is also hated by the 'critical class'." Richard Brody, in a New Yorker report, cited Kenny G in the film responding "cheerful[ly]" to a question about what he loves about music, with, "I don‚Äôt know if I love music that much," and continuing, "when I listen to music, I think about the musicians and I just think about what it takes to make that music and how much they had to practice."
