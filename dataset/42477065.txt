== History ==
Total Control was formed in 2008 by Eddy Current Suppression Ring band member Mikey Young and UV Race's Dan Stewart. The pair, who came together over a shared interest of early 1980s acts such as Devo, Gary Numan, The Screamers, and The Adolescents, recorded some songs using a sampler and synthesizers at Young's home studio. They gained a following over the next few years after releasing a series of 7-inch singles and playing only a handful of live shows. Total Control became a quintet with the additions of guitarist Al Montfort, bassist Zephyr Pavey, and drummer James Vinciguerra. Young explained the reason for the expansion to The Washington Post: "Bands with drum machines and three synths are just not as much fun to watch as bands with drummers and guitars," he said. "We realized it couldn't be good live, so we tried to adapt the songs to work in a rock-and-roll band."The band released their debut full-length album, Henge Beat, in August 2011 on Seattle's Iron Lung Records. They went on a US tour with San Francisco-based band Thee Oh Sees, with whom they also released a split EP, and performed at the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in Minehead, Somerset in December 2011. The single "Scene From a Marriage" was released by Sub Pop in October 2012. The group released their second album, Typical System, in June 2014.
