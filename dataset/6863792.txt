Niño Josele (born Juan José Heredia, 24 April 1974) is a Spanish guitarist, and exponent of the New flamenco style.
His first two albums show a vibrant, pure, modern flamenco style.
He then released a tribute to Bill Evans' music via his album Paz, showing his versatility as a musician. Having originated in a flamenco background, Josele adapts to complicated jazz music themes as well as creating his own mixture of various genres in his own compositions.
He has participated in the award-winning short film Almendros los Plaza Nueva and "La sombra de las cuerdas" 2009 (By Annabelle Ameline, Benoît Bodlet & Chechu G. Berlanga), a portrait of the guitar genius "El Niño Miguel".
