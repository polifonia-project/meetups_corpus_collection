Chris Sullivan (October 23, 1974 – November 10, 2020), known professionally as DJ Spinbad, was a DJ, producer, and remixer on New York City's radio station WHTZ.


== Career ==
DJ Spinbad was a guest on the syndicated radio show Live In Tha Den With Big Tigger. 
Spinbad was also formerly heard on WWPR at 10:00 p.m.–12:00 a.m. on Fridays. He was also heard on WHTZ in twenty-minute sets at 7:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. on weekdays, Fridays at 5:00 p.m., and Saturdays and Sundays at 7:00 p.m. He was also heard on WHTZ on Saturdays from 11:00 p.m.–2:00 a.m. live from Webster Hall in New York City. Recent recession cutbacks, according to his MySpace page, forced WHTZ to cut him from their lineup.
In 2011, Spinbad returned to WHTZ as a part of the Saturday Night Online staff, which is also simulcast in other various radio markets around the country through syndication by Premiere Radio Networks.
DJ Spinbad toured with electronic artist Moby, and produced one of the albums in the Fabric Live series, described by Allmusic as "literally a party in a can", while Resident Advisor stated that it was "mixed extremely well". Spinbad also mixed the 2001 collection Underground Airplay Version 1.0. He also is credited with having the most bootlegged mix CD titled Rocks the Casbah (The '80s Megamix).
Spinbad deejayed for Russell Peters' comedy tours.
On November 10, 2020, DJ Spinbad died in New York City.
