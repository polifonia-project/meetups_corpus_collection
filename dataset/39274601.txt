James Albert Beck (August 11, 1916 – May 3, 1956) was an American country music talent agent, record promoter, recording studio owner, A&R engineer, record producer, and music publisher from Dallas, Texas. Born in Marshall, Texas, Beck is credited with discovering and, in 1950, being the first to record Lefty Frizzell.  He is also credited for introducing Frizzell and Ray Price to Frank Jones (1926–2005) of Columbia Records, which led to their first major recording contracts.  Marty Robbins recorded his first hit — "I'll Go on Alone" — at Beck's studio.  Beck's studio also recorded a few hits by Carl Smith at his studio.  Record labels and producers who recorded at Jim Beck Studios included Decca (via Paul Cohen), Bullet, King, Imperial, and Columbia Records.  Between 1954 and 1956, Frankie Miller recorded a series of singles for Columbia at Beck's studio.
