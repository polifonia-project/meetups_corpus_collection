In 2018, Al Gomes and Connie Watrous of Big Noise served as Executive Producers, along with Simon, for the remastering and re-release of Simon's collection of solo piano interpretations of pop classics by The Beach Boys. Grammy Award-winning Beach Boys producer Alan Boyd also assisted heavily with the project. The album was placed on the Official Ballot for the 61st Annual Grammy Awards by The Recording Academy for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album. Further validation of the recording was achieved when The Beach Boys' official magazine ESQ posted a rave review of the album. 'Just beautiful,' said Beach Boy Mike Love.
