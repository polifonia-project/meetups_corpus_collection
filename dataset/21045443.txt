Blue Monday (2001–2006) was a Canadian, Vancouver-based hardcore punk band.


== History ==
Blue Monday was formed by guitarist Kyle De Ville and vocalist Dave Mac in the spring of 2001. After securing drummer Chris Pratt and bassist Tony Patrick, the band wrote an eight-song demo which came out in early 2002. After a few short tours down the west coast, Blue Monday entered the studio again in mid-2002 and recorded the 7" EP War Wounds  which came out in early 2003 on now-defunct For The Core Records.Pratt and Patrick left the band, and Adam Mitchell and Jason Kehoe joined on bass and drums respectively. Adam's brother, guitarist Dave Mitchell, joined at the end of 2003. That year, Blue Monday released their second EP, What's Done Is Done on Stab And Kill Records. The band spent the bulk of 2003 and 2004 touring throughout the US, with fellow hardcore bands such as Mental, Desperate Measures, Far From Breaking, Lights Out, Final Word, Internal Affairs, The Distance, and Allegiance.
What's Done Is Done and the subsequent touring brought Blue Monday to the attention of seminal modern hardcore label Bridge Nine Records, which signed them after they played the Summer Hardcore Festival Posi-Numbers in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  In December 2004, Blue Monday entered Atomic Studios in Brooklyn, New York and recorded their debut album for Bridge Nine (engineered by Dean Baltulonis). With the release of Rewritten in the spring of 2005, Blue Monday toured with label mates Champion and Terror, and completed a full US tour with Allegians, and fellow Vancouver band Go It Alone. In October 2005, Blue Monday co-headlined a tour in Europe with Go It Alone.In 2006, Rivalry Records released a split EP of recorded performances from the tour.
