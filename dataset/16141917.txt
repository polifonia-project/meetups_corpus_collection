Alpert's only album as a leader was Trigger Happy (Riverside, 1956), which he recorded with  Al Cohn,  Urbie Green,  Tony Scott, Ed Shaughnessy, Zoot Sims, and Joe Wilder.He was a member of the CBS Orchestra with a rhythm section of Hank Jones, Sonny Igoe, and Chuck Wayne until the late 1960s.

Alpert wrote two instructional books: Walking the Bass (1958) and the Electric Bass (1968).
