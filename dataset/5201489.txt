Eric Sardinas (born November 10, 1970) is an American blues-rock slide guitarist born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  He is noted for his use of the electric resonator guitar and his live performances. He sometimes sets his guitar alight on stage and during shows.  In 2000 in Sydney, Sardinas suffered third degree burns to his left wrist.
Sardinas began to play the guitar at age six and leaned toward vintage recordings by such Delta bluesmen as Charlie Patton, Bukka White, Big Bill Broonzy, Elmore James, and Muddy Waters.  Although he was left-handed, he eventually started to play right-handed.
In 2002, he was featured on the Bo Diddley tribute album Hey Bo Diddley - A Tribute!, performing the song "Ride On Josephine".
He signed to Steve Vai's Favored Nations record label and was the opening act for Vai's The Real Illusions Tour 2005 around the world.
In 2008, Sardinas released Eric Sardinas and Big Motor on Favored Nations in the U.S.
