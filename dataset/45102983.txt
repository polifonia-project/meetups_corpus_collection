== Biography ==
After having graduated from University of the Witwatersrand with a bachelor's degree in Music, Loveday landed a career for a few advertising companies, two of which are Standard Bank and South African Broadcasting Corporation. She returned to school in the late 1990s, and became a part-time lecturer. Once she achieved her master's degree in Music Composition, she started to collaborate with other artists and compose her own music and is most known for her saxophone pieces. 
Clare Loveday then became a full-time lecturer at Wits University, while working towards her doctorate in Music Composition. She has been commissioned by several organisations like "The South African Music Rights Organization" and many more. Although Loveday has worked her talents towards music composition, she has turned her career into a broader spectrum of music, including collaborations, research and teaching.
