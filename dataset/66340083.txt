Kelvin Skidmore Matthewson Thomas  (14 September 1919 – 14 June 2019) was a Welsh conductor, composer, baritone, and author. He was the founder and conductor of The Silver Ring Choir of Bath, and one of the founders and first music director of the Bradford-on-Avon Choral Society.


== Background ==

Born in Grangetown, Cardiff, Wales, Kelvin was one of the five children of the coal merchant Charles Thomas and his wife Lena Thomas. He received musical training from an early age from his musical parents.
As a boy soprano from the age of five, in 1931 (aged twelve) he had a test recording for the Concord record label (the recording was never released). In 1927, the Thomas family removed from Cardiff to Bathampton near Bath, Somerset, and were later involved in the building of Bathampton Methodist Church. During his early years of performances, Thomas once performed in the same concert as the American actor and bass baritone Paul Robeson at the Colston Hall, Bristol.Having continued his musical studies (also playing the violin and piano) throughout his early years, and his interest in singing continued as a baritone (rather than soprano). After a period employed in his father's business as a coal merchant, he worked for the Engineering firm, Stothert and Pitt.

In 1951, he founded the mixed voice chamber choir, The Silver Ring Choir of Bath, and was their Conductor and Musical Director for almost forty years (1951–90). During this time, the Choir featured regularly on BBC Radio and Television (1958–94), achieving great success and winning numerous competitions, including first in its class in the National Eisteddfod of Wales. The Choir also toured various countries including Germany (1961), Hungary (1971), and the United States (1976).

In 1986, when the pianist Gaynor Briscoe was founding the Bradford-on-Avon Choral Society, she invited him to become the Society's first Musical Director, a post which he filled for eight years (1986–94). From initial performances of part songs, anthems, and madrigals, the choir progressed to performing works such as Haydn's Creation, Mendelssohn's Elijah, and Brahms's German Requiem, and later participated in annual Trowbridge and West Wiltshire Music Festivals, amongst others. Thomas also arranged and composed numerous pieces of music for these – and other – choirs (SATB), including many traditional Welsh and other melodies. One of his compositions was Samuel's Hymn, which he later recorded with The Silver Ring Choir of Bath.

In 2017, aged 98, he again performed with The Silver Ring Choir of Bath in a Christmas Concert.
