== Career ==
Told by his art teachers that he would never make it as an artist due to his crude style, he quit art and became a full-time magician. After a few years, his passion for art overtook him and he created the comic Lenore, the Cute Little Dead Girl for Xenophobe magazine. The comic strips were later seen by Dan Vado, president of Slave Labor Graphics.
Dirge has also written books such as Something At The Window Is Scratching, The Monsters In My Tummy, The Cat With A Really Big Head: And One Other Story That Isn't As Good and has done work for The Haunted Mansion comics. He has over 75 tattoos.On February 26, 2013, Dirge was injured in a hit-and-run accident in Hollywood, California, while crossing the street. He and his then girlfriend Amber were crossing the street in the crosswalk when a large SUV was about to hit Amber and Roman pushed her aside, which caused Roman to be directly hit.  One of Dirge's legs was severely injured and had to be rebuilt with a metal rod, but he was said to be in good spirits despite facing a long recovery.  Roman is still not fully recovered.
