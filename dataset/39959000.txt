They released the "low key" EP in 1997, the "No Single" 7 inch white vinyl in 1998, "Resonances: Live Film Music" CD in 2000, "Save Your Breath" CD 2001, and "The Super8 Video LP" DVD in 2007. The Brass Bed played exclusively in Melbourne from 1997 - 2007, apart from one performance as a duo in Auckland, New Zealand in 2001 as a duo (Stu Thomas and Delaney Davidson).
