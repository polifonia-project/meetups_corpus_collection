Little Bruce began rapping in 1989 and had a feud with Mac Dre from then until 1991, where the two rappers made several diss tracks towards each other. He was signed to Sick Wid' It in 1990 and released his debut album in 1994. Before releasing it Little Bruce appeared on several Sick Wid It Records releases, including: Tryin' to Get a Buck, Federal and Down and Dirty.
