Yūka Nanri (南里 侑香, Nanri Yūka, born March 13, 1984) is a Japanese actress, voice actress and J-pop singer from Sasebo, Nagasaki. She is represented by Space Craft Entertainment.


== Biography ==
Yūka Nanri debuted on NHK's Utatte Odoronpa (うたってオドロンパ) (an educational programme) in 1995 as a child star.
In 1997, she joined Minami Aoyama Shōjo Kageki Dan (南青山少女歌劇団, South Aoyama Female Opera Group, also known as Nanshō), a stage group for young girls as one of its seventh generation members, and acted in musicals and other theatrical performances.
Nanri left the group in August 2001 and made her voice acting debut that year as Bubbles in the Japanese version of The Powerpuff Girls. After that, she officially started her voice acting activities as the protagonist of Gunslinger Girl. She has voiced many weak-looking and gentle characters, though in My-HiME she played Nao Yūki, a morally ambivalent middle school student who enjoys preying on perverted men.
In late 2003 Nanri formed tiaraway, a voice acting duo with fellow Japanese singer Saeko Chiba. After releasing three singles and an album tiaraway disbanded on March 6, 2005 after its first (and final) live concert. Nanri and Chiba cited wanting to go down separate paths as the reason for ending the group.
In 2006 Nanri was asked to voice Karen Ichijō from the second season of the anime School Rumble, but she turned it down to play the main character of the musical ANGEL GATE ~Haru no Yokan~ (ANGEL GATE～春の予感～, ANGEL GATE ~Spring's Premonition~), and participated in four performances from April 13–16. She graduated from university in March of the same year with an academic degree in vocal music.Nanri is a currently a vocalist for Yuki Kajiura's "FictionJunction Yuuka" project. She held her first solo concert, entitled Premium Live 2007, as FictionJunction Yuuka in February 2007.Nanri's first mini-album, "LIVE ON!", was released August 22, 2012.
