== Music ==


=== uncertain ===
In 2007, uncertain began as the solo project of Florian-Ayala Fauna. Initially, she made ambient and drone music with the computer programme Ableton. Her first album glass fawn was an ambient soundscape about a deer getting lost. It often involved field recordings, processed sounds, and tape loops while their current cycle (since 2012) features albums about a family of foxes done with composition, sampling, and complex music production on Ableton Live and Kontakt. Influences include Aleister Crowley, Hermeticism, Arvo Pärt, Coil, Current 93, Throbbing Gristle, and alchemy. As of 2016, Fauna is the main producer and collaborates with others, primarily with Felix Keigh who is her fiancé and main vocalist.


=== Live performances ===
uncertain started doing live performances in 2013. Cities for live performances have included Boston, Cincinnati, Columbus, Ohio, and New York City. However, her chronic fatigue limits touring. They use visuals such as the use of animal masks, candles, lights, video projections, and ritualistic costumes. Live shows have included performances alongside TRNSGNDR/VHS.


=== Collaborations ===
Fauna has collaborated with former Coil member Stephen Thrower (Cyclobe, UnicaZürn), Esperik Glare's Charlie Martineau (In Serpents and Seas), and others. Thrower contributed an opening track to her 2016 album Dark Night of the Soul. She has also frequently done artwork for Swiss post-industrial musicians and artists Black Sun Productions. Her most recent collaboration was with London-based industrial hip hop artist Ubik MCDXCII, providing production work for the track "Rites and Ceremonies" on his album "Blackout Blinds".


== Reception ==
In February 2013, Orange County, California alternative weekly OC Weekly's Dave Barton called dancing with the blind (lost children) "atmospheric and haunting" and "one of the most evocative titles for an album I've ever heard." In August 2016, The Public's Cory Perla described both her art and music as "otherworldly." In March 2017, British music magazine The Quietus's Russell Cuzner summed up her music as "somehow fulfil[s] a similar aesthetic to the artist's equally prolific visual art that often depict animal heads [...] as if charged with some kind of hidden power, part gothic horror, part Gnostic totem." In December 2019, Columbus Alive's Andy Downing said God Is a Man Eater was "dense, buzzing, six-track song cycle."


== Politics ==
Fauna supports anti-fascism and identifies as an anarchist.
