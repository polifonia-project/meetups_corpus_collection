The song is featured in Season 5, Episode 7 of the CW teen drama Gossip Girl.In 2014, he released his second album, Post Tropical, which included the song "Glacier". The song was used in the 2014 Spanish Christmas Lottery advertising campaign. The album was recorded in 2013 in the small desert town of Tornillo, 89 kilometres (55 mi) south of El Paso in Texas. The studio is located on a pecan farm, and McMorrow found the location "the most surreal place to work", and one that helped add to the tone of the album and inspire his creativity. He said "I think it's kind of engrained in the record, more than any pinpointed thing. I can hear the hot bedded air in this part. You can hear the birds in the pianos."In 2015, he composed a film score for the short, "Martha", directed by Sam Benenati. In 2016, his cover of the Chris Isaak song "Wicked Game" was used in the first official full-length trailer for the sixth season of the HBO hit series Game of Thrones. 
In April 2016, he was featured on the promotional single "I'm in Love" from Kygo's debut album, Cloud Nine.
In July 2016, McMorrow announced his third studio album and released "Rising Water", its lead single. We Move was produced by McMorrow, Nineteen85, Frank Dukes and Two Inch Punch, and was released on 2 September 2016. It marks a shift in McMorrow's style towards more R&B-tinged sounds. He released his fourth studio album True Care on 26 May 2017.
