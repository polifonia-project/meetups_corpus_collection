He grew up in a poor single parent household and lived with his mother in a room little bigger than 100sqft on the top floor of a block of apartments in Parisian Dense with her great-grandmother. He studied at the Lycée Janson de Sailly in Paris, considered one of the best schools in Europe.As his mother worked, he grew accustomed to solitude and independence. At the age of 12, he cooked cakes as a gift for her after her workday. He confessed that for him, becoming an adult was more a way to learn to get out of trouble, as before his parents separated, he witnessed violence, drugs and abuse. Due to this psychological impact, he became a cautious, introverted and repressed child. However, with the help of child specialists, he was able to overcome this feeling of repression.
