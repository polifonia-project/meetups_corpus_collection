In February 1959 John Cage arrived in Padova (during one of his first journeys in Italy) and Teresa Rampazzi gave a concert with him and with Heinz-Klaus Metzger and Sylvano Bussotti. They played Music for Piano, Winter Music, Variations I & II, Music Walk.Later she sold her piano and with Ennio Chiggio formed the NPS Group (Nuove Proposte Sonore), an experimental collective to research sound generation with analogue devices. (Her husband bought back the piano.) She continued to work with Chiggio until 1968, and continue her activity with the NPS group until 1972 when she took a teaching position in 1972 as professor of electronic music at the Padova Conservatory (one of the first electronic music courses in Italy), where she continued to work on tone research and to publish professional articles on electronic music. She worked internationally at the Institute of Sonology in Utrecht, at Catholic University in Washington, at the electromusic studio in Stockholm, at the department of computer music at the University of Pisa and at the CSC Computer Music Center in Padova.After her husband died in 1983, Rampazzi moved to Assisi and then to Bassano, where she continued to compose.
