Jeff Hartford, better known by his stage name Attlas (stylized as ATTLAS), is a Canadian DJ, electronic music producer and musician.


== Early life and career ==
Hartford grew up surrounded by a variety of musical influences, including New Orleans jazz, Beethoven, hip-hop, and hard rock. After moving to Detroit, he learned to play a piano that was left in the basement of his home and began composing his own music. Later, an interest in electronic music was fostered by listening to productions from Matt Lange, deadmau5, and various artists from Warp Records.Eventually, Hartford sent his music to mau5trap who signed him. The moniker ATTLAS was a sort of mask that he could put on to assume a new identity and separate his music from his personal self. The name was chosen because the ambiguity would allow him to cover a variety of sounds and was a reference to the influence that physical and emotional geographies, histories, and stories have on his writing.In 2015, Hartford released the singles "Scarlett", "Wastaga" and "Beside". These tracks were later included in an EP trilogy consisting of Siren, Scene and Sin through mau5trap throughout the year. He also performed his first live shows as ATTLAS in June.In February 2016, he joined other mau5trap label artists on the MAU5HAX BU5 TOUR across the United States. Hartford then released the single "Aspen" in April. After a brief hiatus, he released another single,"Ryat", in June ahead of the full Bloom EP, a self-described collection of calm, fresh air and vocal collaborations. The EP saw general praise, and the track "I Need You More" was recognized on Billboard's Top 25 Relaxing & Calming Songs to Chill To playlist in 2017. He also released the song "Blood Work" in November.  At the end of 2016, Hartford embarked on a seven show tour across Canada and the United States to promote the second installment of his Storyline mix series and closed the year out by giving away the song "Thanks" for free to his Soundcloud followers as a way of expressing gratitude for his fans. Hartford was named in Billboard's "One to watch" for 2016.In 2017, Hartford released the singles  "Frost",  "Further", and "What You Do To Me". A collaboration with deadmau5 titled "bad at titles" was included on mau5trap's We are Friends, Vol. 6 compilation and received positive attention.At the end of 2019, Harford suffered an accident related to his foot that made activities like hiking, songwriting, and  occasionally even sleep impossible for a time. Some of the ideas that came from this hardship eventually found their way onto later tracks, such as "Polar Concept" from his second album, Out Here With You.In August 2021, Hartford released the single "Into Arms of Lovers" featuring Maylyn.


== deadmau5 alias rumors ==
After releasing a few of his songs on mau5trap, a rumor circulated that ATTLAS was a side project of Joel Zimmerman aka deadmau5 akin to the Testpilot moniker debuted in 2014. Some even theorized that the name was a reference to the video game Bioshock and was a clue to the secret nature of the project.  Although he mentioned his first name in some interviews, ATTLAS' identity was not fully known until Pete Tong revealed it on his Evolution broadcast on iHeartRadio. Tong said "There's been a sneaky suspicion that he's deadmau5 in disguise. However I can now reveal that he's a fellow Canadian producer called Jeff Hartford."Speaking about the beginning of his career and how fans assumed he was an alias of deadmau5, Hartford said:
"When I sent my music to deadmau5's label and he chose to release it, people started assuming that my music was actually his side project... That response was such a big compliment to me... because Joel has always been a huge inspiration. But while it was fun for a bit, I suddenly thought about how I had to start being Jeff, so that I wasn't being disrespectful to the brand that deadmau5 has built over the years."
