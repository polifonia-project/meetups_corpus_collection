Shaw received some of her early musical training in Southeastern Louisiana University's Community Music School.

Shaw would have graduated from Mount Carmel Academy in New Orleans in 2008 but she opted instead to continue traveling around the country to perform.  She called her decision to leave Mount Carmel a difficult one.  Shaw earned her G.E.D. in 2008 and planned to attend Tulane University but did not enroll.

In 2006 Shaw signed with Rounder Records. Two years later she released her third album Pretty Runs Out on Rounder.Shaw has appeared in two Disney Channel original movies filmed in New Orleans: Stuck in the Suburbs (2004) and Now You See It...
