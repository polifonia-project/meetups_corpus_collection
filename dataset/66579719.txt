Dustin Tatro  is an American musician who is the stadium organist for Major League Baseball's Texas Rangers.

Tatro serves as organist at St. Paul United Methodist Church in Abilene, Texas, and is also a 20-year radio personality currently serving as OM/APD for an FM station and formerly hosting middays for Q Country 96.1 (KORQ) and a late-night rock program on KGNZ. He also holds certification as a Texas EMT. He is the founder and host of the globally-syndicated weekly radio show called The RockDown Show with Dustin Tatro [1], which features artist interviews and counts down the top ten songs in Christian Rock.Tatro began working for the Rangers in early 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic. He is the first official organist of the Rangers since Marcia Rogers left in 2001 after playing since the opening of Globe Life Park in Arlington in 1994. He got the job when Chuck Morgan, Executive Vice President for Ballpark Entertainment, saw videos Tatro had posted on social media while rehearsing for a major pipe organ recital and reached out to invite him to become organist for the Rangers.Beginning with the 2020 Major League Baseball season, the Texas Rangers began playing at Globe Life Field, which, as of September 2021, does not have an organ installed.  For the 2020 season, Tatro recorded approximately 750 pieces of organ music on a refurbished 1951 Hammond C2 organ that he acquired from the storage of a local Baptist church. He also recorded some songs on the 2,800-pipe Garland organ at St. Paul UMC Abilene, where he has been the organist since 2014.  Like many other stadium organists, Tatro takes requests on social media.
