Irving Domingo Lorenzo Jr. (born June 26, 1970), better known by his stage name Irv Gotti, is an American DJ, record producer, and the CEO and co-founder of Murder Inc. He is best known for producing multiple number-one records for Ashanti, Ja Rule, and Jennifer Lopez, as well as his collaborations with Jay-Z, DMX, and Kanye West. Gotti is also the creator of the BET series Tales.


== Early life ==
Irv Gotti was born in the Hollis neighborhood of the borough of Queens in New York City.


== Career ==
After helping Def Jam with the success of DMX and Jay-Z, Russell Simmons gave Irv Gotti his own label under Def Jam. While watching Biography on A&E during gangster week, a Murder, Inc. logo appeared on the screen and Irv Gotti decided to use the name for his label because Murder, Inc. put out hits for murder and Irv wanted to put out hit records.
Murder Inc. would change their name to The Inc. after a 2003 investigation, including a raid on the Manhattan offices of Murder, Inc., resulted in charges of money laundering being brought against Gotti and his brother Christopher in connection with alleged financial transactions associated with New York City drug kingpin Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff.  On December 2, 2005, a jury acquitted the brothers of all charges. The label would change their name to appeal better to the public.
Under The Inc. banner, Irv would move the label to Universal Motown and sign Vanessa Carlton. Gotti co-produced Vanessa Carlton's third album, Heroes and Thieves, which was released October 9, 2007, with Channel 7, Rick Rubin and Stephan Jenkins.
In an interview with Angie Martinez in early May 2009, Gotti stated that his label, Murder Inc., was leaving Universal Records.
In September 2013, Murder Inc. was relaunched as an umbrella label under Irv Gotti's new label, Visionary.
