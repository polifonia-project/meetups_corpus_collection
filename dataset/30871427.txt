Playa Fly (born Ibn Young on September 2, 1977) is an American rapper from Memphis, Tennessee. Fly was a member of the Three 6 Mafia (then known as Lil' Fly), but he stopped collaborating in 1995 due to monetary disputes and philosophical differences after recording one album under the group's guidance. Pursuing a solo career as Playa Fly, he released one independent album before signing a three-album contract with Super Sigg Records. During that period he had many underground hits, perhaps the most famous being "Nobody Needs Nobody". Fly's early hit immediately gained notoriety from the song "Triple Bitch Mafia", which lashed out against his former group.

=== Early life and Triple 6 Mafia ===
Young was born in Memphis in 1977 and grew up on South Parkway where he largely raised by his grandmother. His father was the musician Willie David Young. A.K.A, Mr. Bill Chill, a former member of The Avantis and The Ovations, while his mother was a drug dealer, an activity that Young also got involved in at the age of thirteen.Under the title Lil' Fly, Young began his career at the age of sixteen, testing the waters with "Don't Never Test His Pimpin" as a start. He eventually became affiliated with DJ Paul and Juicy J of Triple 6 Mafia (Now known as Three 6 Mafia) and under the wing of the up-and-coming producers, "Slangin' Rocks" was produced (part one featured on his underground single, part two featured on DJ Paul's Vol. 16 For Da Summa Of '94). He was featured on Gangsta Blac's underground hit album, Breakin Da Law, and the Three 6 Mafia's first mainstream album, Mystic Stylez. It was even planned for releasing Fly's first album on their label (which was, at that time, Prophet Entertainment) and his first single, "From Da Darkness Of Da Kut", was released in 1994. After leaving the group a year later, Fly put out his infamous diss record, "Triple Bitch Mafia", then changed his title to Playa Fly and was featured on Tommy Wright III's On the Run album before signing with Super Sigg Records.
