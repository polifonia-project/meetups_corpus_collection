== Career ==


=== 1998–2012: Six as One, IOYou, Westlife ===

Feehily rose to fame as one of the two lead vocalists of the boy band Westlife, the other being Shane Filan. Before Westlife, Feehily, Filan and Kian Egan were members of the self-formed, six-piece, Sligo-based boy band IOYOU, previously named Six As One, which released the single "Together Girl Forever" and songs "Everlasting Love" and "Good Thing." Louis Walsh, the manager of Boyzone, was contacted by Filan's mother and came to know about the group. The final line-up, established on 3 July 1998, consisted of Feehily, Filan, and Egan from the original line-up, and Nicky Byrne and Bryan McFadden, new members who auditioned from Dublin. Boyzone singer Ronan Keating was brought in to co-manage the group with Walsh, assuming an advisory role. 

Feehily has sung completely solo on songs for the band in several instances:

"Imaginary Diva" (from the World of Our Own album)
"Moon River" (from the ...Allow Us to Be Frank album)
"Talk Me Down" (from the Where We Are album)
"Before It's Too Late" (from the Gravity album).During live performances, Feehily has also sung completely solo for the songs "Oh Holy Night," "Imaginary Diva," "Talk Me Down," "Before It's Too Late," and Boy George's "Il Adore." In addition to being a lead vocalist, Feehily has also co-written several songs, including some with his band members. Feehily has spoken to The Boston Globe of his embarrassment about Westlife's Rat Pack-tribute album, ...Allow Us to Be Frank; he blamed Westlife's label for forcing them to record it after Robbie Williams had success with this type of music. He dismissed the instance as a "weird time" in Westlife's career. Despite this, he has referred to his role in Westlife as "the best job in the world."


=== 2015–2018: Solo career ===
As well as releasing music as part of Westlife, Feehily has also released music as a solo artist, under the name "Markus Feehily" rather than "Mark Feehily", which he was known as in Westlife. In February 2015, Feehily launched his solo career with a radio premiere of his debut single "Love Is a Drug" on RTÉ 2fm in Ireland. The next day the track premiered online, via Wonderland Magazine. Moments after the premiere of the song, it was made available for pre-order on iTunes, with the official video for the track launching on his Vevo channel two weeks later. The song was released on 19 April 2015. He released his debut solo studio album Fire on 16 October 2015. It includes the singles "Love Is a Drug" and "Butterfly."
He was a support act for Wet Wet Wet and Mariah Carey. He was also invited by Russell Crowe at Olympia Theatre, Dublin, October 1, 2017 for his "Dublin Indoor Garden Party gig" to sing "Love Was My Alibi", written by Crowe and Carl Falk for the film The Water Diviner, which Crowe both directed and starred in, accompanied by Alan Doyle and Falk.  His second album Christmas, featuring the track "River", a rendition of the song by Joni Mitchell, was released on 1 December 2017.
