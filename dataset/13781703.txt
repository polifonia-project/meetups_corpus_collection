== Career ==
It was in Manchester that his musical career began. Initially working behind the counter at Eastern Bloc records. He went on to DJ at the Konspiracy club in Manchester, and began his own Sunday club Spice with fellow DJ Greg Fenton. In the early 1990s he started the Most Excellent club and played at The Haçienda. Subsequently, he went on to run Sleuth with Richard Hector-Jones and was one of the residents at Bugged Out. He has released several DJ mix albums. Robertson continues to perform DJ sets at venues and festivals globally.
Robertson also began a remix career, re working acts such as Björk, Erasure, Happy Mondays, Paul Weller, Justice, and many others.
Since 2003 he has been living and working from London. He has remixed dozens of high-profile music artists, either as himself or as The Prankster, Revtone or The Deadstock 33s, fronted the groups Lionrock and Thee Earls, and has released albums and singles of original music under his own name. Robertson at one time operated the vanity record label Neverwork. Since 2015 Robertson has been signed to Skint records, with whom he released the Deadstock 33s album Everything is Turbulence.

== Art ==
In 2015 Robertson created a travelling art show of oil paintings called Everything is Turbulence exhibiting in London, Leeds, Manchester, Stockholm and Ireland. The show examined notions of chaos and mystery through images of imagined creatures.
In 2016 Robertson produced a collection of pencil drawings and mixed media called 'The Explorer's Chronicle', launching at the Red Gallery in London, before traveling to the Refuge in Manchester. The show related to 'the mystery of science, the joy of exploration, and the importance of the imagination'.
In 2018 Robertson Continued his exploration of various philosophical themes in his art with 'It's Alive'. The exhibition at the Book Club, Shoreditch, London, explored questions of what it is to be human, what it is to be a conscious being and to what extent everything is 'alive'. Philosophical ideas touched on included Panpsychism and Secular animism.
In 2019 Robertson exhibited a collection of paintings and mixed media called 'Alone' initially at the Folk clothing store on Redchurch street in London. The work explored themes of voluntary and involuntary separation, loneliness, loss and the hermetic life.
