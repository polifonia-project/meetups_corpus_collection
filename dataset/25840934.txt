Mike Richmond (born February 26, 1948 in Philadelphia) is an American jazz bassist.
Richmond started on guitar then picked up bass in his early teens. He attended Temple University (1965–1970), studying with Edward Arian from the Philadelphia Orchestra. After lessons with Jimmy Garrison in the early 1970s he began performing with Chico Hamilton and Arnie Lawrence, also working with Stan Getz, Jack DeJohnette, Horace Silver, Joe Henderson, Lee Konitz, Hubert Laws, Franco Ambrosetti, Dannie Richmond, Gil Evans, Art Farmer, Woody Herman, and George Gruntz.
Starting in 1980, Richmond devoted time to learning the sitar, traveling to Madras, India and performing live with Ravi Shankar. He led Mingus Dynasty (replacing Mingus) from 1980–1985, and began teaching at New York University in 1988 (Teacher of the Year, 1991 & 1994).
Richmond won a Grammy Award for Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux. His book Modern Walking Bass Technique is used internationally.
