== Career ==
In the middle of the 1990s, Cut Killer had already become a well-respected and active DJ. He adapted and consolidated New York hip-hop in France through many of his mix tapes, mixing the latest releases and freestyles of French rap, they became favorites and collectors' items. His dynamic mixes, his smartness to catch the best 12 inches before anyone, and his flair to find local rappers made his mix-tapes important. The big number of top brass of the second generation of French rap went through this: Sages Poètes de la Rue, Lunatic, 113 and many others. The Hip Hop Soul Party series, composed of double mixed CDs, started in 1996 at MCA’s. From the second volume on, exclusive tracks began to appear from Fabe, Busta Flex, among others, with one CD dedicated to hip-hop, the other to R&B. In volume three, a CD was dedicated to international hip-hop, the other to French hip-hop.
Killer, after the death of his rapper mate East established a label called Double H (for Hip-Hop) as a merchandising company and then a production label. In a few years, HH became one of the most influential independent labels on the market. When shifting from Universal to Small (Sony), the Hip-Hop Soul Party project became the Cut Killer Show with a first double CD published in 1997 (containing an outro by Jamel Debbouze), followed in 1998 by Operation Freestyle, a record fully dedicated to French underground. In 1999, Cut Killer and his associates produced R&B 2000, the collective album Double H DJ Crew, but also highly respected artists such as Fabe, Doudou Masta and 113, who managed to make their album Les Princes de la Ville a platinum record to end up winning two "Victoires de la Musique" (French music awards) in 2000. Double H is still developing with a team of street marketing, a clothing line "HH Wear", a publishing company called "Eastory Editions", followed by another production and publishing label "Eastory Production". Besides, Killer is booked by Chaos Prod agency, created by his brother Chakri.
As The Hip-Hop Soul Party and Cut Killer Show series reached the top of the charts and brought in gold and platinum awards, Cut Killer delegated R&B to his longtime accomplice, DJ Abdel, West Coast music to the specialist DJ Cream, and gave himself a try with dancehall Ragga Killa Show, before coming back to the French sound with 1 Son 2 Rue. Over the years, Cut Killer made or produced about twenty mixed albums.
Fond of the cinema, Cut Killer mixed music in La Haine, where he played music from Édith Piaf and NTM on KRS-One’s beat. Many offers followed and he signed several tracks on the OSTs of Zak Fishman’s Gamer, Fred Garson’s The Dancer, and Miguel Courtois’ Un Ange. He signed the complete score for Fabrice Genstal's La Squale, with Herve Rakoto and Sofiane Le Cat's, followed by Le Raid (Djamel Bensallah), Trois Zéro (Fabien Onteniente), Peau d’Ange (Vincent Perez)...
In the middle of the decade, Cut Killer returned to the fundamentals of dee-jaying on radio, and after four years on Radio Nova, he joins Skyrock, where he has a weekly show the best of global hip-hop evolution. Truly an international DJ, he became the first French DJ booked in the USA through Funkmaster Flex’ DJ Big Dawg Pitbulls and 50 Cent's Shadyville DJs.
