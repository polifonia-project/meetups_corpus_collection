=== Altercation with King Von ===
On November 6, 2020, an altercation broke out between the crews of rappers King Von and Quando Rondo outside an Atlanta nightclub, leading to a shoot-out that resulted in the death of King Von. Quando and his entourage claimed that they were acting in self-defense and Von was the aggressor; TMZ reported that previous to the brawl, Quando was napping in a car outside the nightclub, awaking to find King Von and his crew angrily approaching him and his associates. There was footage of Von throwing punches at Quando Rondo's crew, prior to the gunfight. Surveillance videos also showed Rondo helping "Lul Timm" get to the hospital afterwards.Quando Rondo publicly remained silent on the incident until two weeks later, when he released his song "End of Story", which was assumed to be a reference to Von's song trilogy, "Crazy Story". In the song, he recalls the shooting and addresses his involvement. In the song, he again states that he was defending himself and even shows support for his friend Timothy Leeks, a rapper also known as Lul Tim, who was charged for the murder of Von. In April 2021, Quando denied that the song was a diss toward Von, and claimed he did not know that Von had songs with that title. Despite receiving strong criticism, Quando has continued to publicly support Leeks.
