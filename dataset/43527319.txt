== Music career ==

Stevens has been playing drums since she was ten years old, she started a garage rock band, the Flairz, at age eleven with a two friends, John and Dion Mariani (the son and nephew of Dom Mariani), both of whom played guitar, vocals and bass guitar. They played their first live show in December 2003, performing around Western Australia, in between school commitments. The band recorded and released two EPs and an album and performed at SXSW. In November 2009, at the end of high school, the Flairz disbanded and Stevens started jamming with other musicians around the same age. She was asked to play on a friend's recording, which led to the formation of King George, which later became San Cisco.
In a 2013 interview with Modern Drummer magazine Stevens recalls that her initial introduction to the drums happened when she met Jack Johnson's drummer, Adam Topol, who showed her how to play a basic rock beat. Following which he invited her to perform onstage for one song at the Forum Theatre in Melbourne and then again at Bonnaroo Music Festival the following year.
In 2014 she established a side project, a two-piece electronic hip-hop group, Ghetto Crystals, with Doug May (the guitarist and brother of Abbe May).
