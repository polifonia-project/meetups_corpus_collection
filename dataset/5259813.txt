In September 2012, it was announced that Sevendust would go to studio to record its ninth album for an early 2013 release.

On December 11, 2004, after playing a Sevendust show in Columbus, Ohio, it was announced that Lowery had left the band mid-tour, because he wanted to play with his brother Corey Lowery in his new band Dark New Day, who had reportedly just signed with Warner Bros. records.

According to Stryper's Facebook page, Sweet said, "I reached out to Clint and asked him if he would like to co-write a track or two for the new Stryper album. Clint agreed and sent me a few riff ideas. I was instantly drawn to the riff that he sent which eventually became 'Yahweh'. I took his original idea and somehow created this 6:30 minute song, which is quite epic and honestly may be one of the most powerful songs we've done in a long time." Lowery responded, "The tune is amazing man. It's got that old school spirit with this modern take. That choir vibe on chorus is beautiful. Vibe change for the solo. Epic my man. Solos are stellar. I don't remember sending anything near this cool". According to the page, Lowery mentioned how Stryper was "an influence on [him] we he was younger."
