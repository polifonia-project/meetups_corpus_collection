Bill Wolfgramm (7 October 1925 — 25 September 2003) aka Bill Wolfgramme was a musician specialising in lap steel guitar and popular Hawaiian music. He was born in the island kingdom of Tonga and was also of German descent. He is the former leader of Bill Wolfgramm & His Islanders, a popular island band in New Zealand that played regularly at the Orange Ballroom, a historic dance venue in Auckland.


== Background ==
He was born in Vava'u. As a teenager he was a member of a band whose lead guitarist was the nephew of Charlie Sanft a well known Tongan steel guitar player and teacher. at that time he was playing ukulele and rhythm guitar. He started playing the steel guitar at 19 years old. At age 23, Wolfgramm immigrated to New Zealand.
His first recording was Fijian Holiday and released as Mavis Rivers with Bill Wolfgramm and His Rhythm on the Tanza label.
A big draw card on the live music scene, he was also a major recording star in New Zealand during the 1950s. During the 1950s when the transition from 78 rpm records to 33 rpm records was taking place, Bill Wolfgramm & His Islanders recorded South Sea Rhythm at Auckland's Astor Recording Studios. This album took four months to record and it featured Daphne Walker. It has the distinction of being one of the first long playing 33rpm records to be pressed in New Zealand. There is a belief by some that this album may have been the first.
He carried on recording up to the 1970s, and active up until the early 1990s.
He died twelve days before his 78th birthday.He was also the uncle of the Wolfgramm family in the USA who formed the band The Jets and steel guitarist and recording artist Nani Wolfgramm.
