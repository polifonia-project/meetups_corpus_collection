== Name ==
Born into the Stovall lineage, his name, "Baptist" was adopted as a ceremonial name deriving from his father’s occupation as a Baptist preacher. His name, Sir, was ascribed during his parochial school years at Saint Leo Catholic. Professionally, the epithet "Sir the Baptist" was used because his model for evangelizing Jesus Christ in the wild was adopted from the prophet, John the Baptist. Sir practiced ritualistic baptisms at music festivals in America and at 22 shows across Europe.


== Baptism tradition ==
Baptist was the 13th generation to be baptized. His ancestors practiced the Baptist tradition on their transatlantic journey during the English Separatist movement in the 1600s. With his Stovall bloodline, the Protestant Reformation to the Church of England (Anglicans) during the separation from the Roman Catholic Church can be traced back for centuries. The first recorded baptism in Baptist’s bloodline can be traced to George Stovall II in the year 1555, in Guildford, Sussex Co., England.
