== Early life ==
Coburn was born in Great Dunmow, Essex. Coming from a musical family, with her mother once working as a backing singer for bands Duran Duran and The The, Coburn learned to play the guitar and piano when she was six years old. On Boxing Day 2007, Coburn played a song she had been writing called "Hurt" to family and friends. A friend of her mother's, Matthew Marston, heard the song and invited her to his home studio to record it. Coburn and Marston later wrote together on her debut album, Rush.
After picking up widespread promotional coverage in the media from The Times, the BBC, and The Guardian as a young artist to watch for in 2010, Coburn was signed to a record company; She was managed by Empire, and signed to Jive, a subsidiary of Sony Records. There was reportedly a 'bidding-war' to get Coburn to sign up to a record company. She mainly used social networking websites to broadcast her music, such as MySpace where she posted demos and her YouTube channel where the video for her song "Daisy Dares You" and "Rosie" can be found.
Coburn's first single, "Number One Enemy", featured British rapper Chipmunk and reached the top 20 in the UK.


== Songwriting, genre and influences ==
Before Coburn was signed she would write songs on her own on a guitar. For her debut album she co-wrote several tracks with her mother's friend Matthew Marston. Much of Coburn's music is about her own personal experiences such as boyfriends, sibling rivalry, disloyal schoolfriends and emotional growing pains. Coming from a musical family and reading poetry has helped Coburn in her writing.Coburn's musical genres vary from teen-pop to pop rock to pop and electropop. Her musical influences also vary, possibly the reason behind her varying genres; Coburn has stated she is influenced by many bands and artists such as Nirvana and Lou Reed. She has stated that her writing is influenced by indie singers such as Florence and the Machine and Bat for Lashes but when she writes "it just seems to come out as pop". Comparisons have been made between her and British singer-songwriter Lily Allen as well as Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne. Regarding her comparison to Avril Lavigne, Coburn stated "just because I'm female and young they have to put you in a box. Frankly, anyone who says I was influenced by Avril Lavigne can get stuffed".


== Rush ==
Rush is the intended debut studio album by Daisy Dares You, and was scheduled to be released in June 2010, with the single "Rosie" released in May 2010. The album was never released.
