== Biography ==
Charles Sullivan was born in New York City. Growing up, Sullivan was taught how to play the trumpet from his two uncles who were both trumpet players. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree from the Manhattan School of Music in 1967. He also worked for multiple off-Broadway productions shortly before and after his graduation. In Spring of 1967 Sullivan made his first trip to Europe; a five month long tour performing with the Donald McKayle Dance Company then toured briefly as Count Basie's lead trumpeter in 1970 and with Lonnie Liston Smith in 1971. In 1974 Sullivan released his first album as bandleader titled Genesis. The album was entirely arraigned, composed, and produced by Sullivan. Throughout most of Sullivan's career he has worked intermittently on many Broadway productions and with orchestras.
