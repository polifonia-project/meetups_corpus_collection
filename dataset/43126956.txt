== On The Voice ==
Pennell auditioned for the fifth season of the American series of The Voice. She turned the chairs of CeeLo Green and Blake Shelton with her blind audition singing Ellie Goulding's "Anything Could Happen." She chose Green to be her coach. In the battle rounds she battled Anthony Paul, singing "As Long As You Love Me" by Justin Bieber. Green chose to advance Pennell to the next round. In the knockout round, she faced George Horga, Jr. singing Ingrid Michaelson's "The Way I Am". She was again picked by Green to advance to the Live Rounds. In the Live Rounds, she sang "We're Going to Be Friends" by The White Stripes and received the public vote. In the Top 10, she sang "Leaving on a Jet Plane" and landed in the bottom three. Before voting in the "Instant Save" system to pick one contestant in the bottom three to move forward, Pennell and Tessanne Chin performed Lorde's "Royals". Pennell was predicted to be the underdog in the bottom three, but after her performance, she received 80% of the Twitter votes, and moving on to the Top 8. The next week, she sang "Dog Days Are Over" and again landed in the bottom three. Matthew Schuler was picked on Twitter by the "Instant Save," ending Pennell's time as a contestant.
Penell originally picked Green because "comfort is a big thing for [her], and CeeLo radiates comfort. [She] just always wanted to hug him".
