== Personal life ==
Persson grew up in Jönköping, Sweden. "I grew up in a middle-class, academic family," Persson said in 2014. "I lived in a villa with a garden. I had two younger brothers."She did not want to be a musician growing up, having an interest in art instead, which resulted in her attending art school. "I never really strived to be a musician; I was just, sort of, recruited into this band. I was bored out of my mind in this small, safe place (Jönköping). I was like, 'Awesome, I get to hang with fun guys.'"On 16 June 2001, Persson married American songwriter and author Nathan Larson.
Persson was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2009, and underwent surgical treatment.
After three attempts at in vitro fertilization, their son Nils was born on 30 September 2010.  For several years the family resided in Harlem, New York City, but in 2015 they decided to relocate to Malmö, the former base of the Cardigans. In an interview with Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter in March 2018, Persson talked about her expatriate years, the return to Sweden and pointed out that the return to her native country was family business and did not reflect any wish to reboot her old band.
