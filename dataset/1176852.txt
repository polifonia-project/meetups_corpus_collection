Gina Bachauer (Greek: Τζίνα Μπαχάουερ; May 21, 1913, Athens – August 22, 1976, Athens), was a Greek classical pianist who toured extensively in the United States and Europe.
Gina Bachauer was born in Athens, Greece. She was Jewish.  She gave her first recital in Athens at the age of eight. She graduated from the Athens Conservatory in 1929.
Her first concert with an orchestra was in 1932, when she was 19 years old. She recorded for the HMV (His Master's Voice), RCA Victor and Mercury labels. She gave hundreds of concerts, including 630 for the Allied troops in the Middle East during World War II. Gina Bachauer was also the piano teacher of Princess Irene.
Bachauer was a close friend of Maurice Abravanel and often appeared with the Utah Symphony Orchestra.
She died in 1976 of a heart attack at the Athens Festival, on the day she was to appear as soloist with the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington, D.C.

The Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition was established in 1976 in her honour. It attracts young pianists from all over the world to Salt Lake City each year.  The house in which Bachauer lived in the Athens suburb of Halandri still stands; neighbours with fond memories of the pianist take care of the grounds.  The house is visited by numerous fans from around the world, who feed the stray cats just as "The Queen Of Pianists" did when she was alive.
In 1981 the Greek Post honored Bachauer by issuing a stamp in her honour.
