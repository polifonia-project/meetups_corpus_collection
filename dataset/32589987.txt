== Music career ==
Polani founded the singing group "HaTarnegolim" ("The Roosters") in 1960, and was in charge of musical and acting direction, and choreography.  The original group included Yehoram Gaon and HaGashash HaHiver.  It was referred to by The Jerusalem Post as "one of the most exciting things that ever happened to Israeli pop. They brought us some of the greatest hits of all times".  Among the group's hits were "The Neighborhood Song," "Everything's Gold," and "My Great Kid Yossi."  Over 30 years later, Polani worked with a new group to create a comeback of the group.
