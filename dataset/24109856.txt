They subsequently jammed at one of the Rivera amp booths and noticed, that although they had different styles, (Tremonti being heavily influenced by metal and Friedman Blues), they both complemented each other.

=== Early years ===
It all started for Friedman when his teenage guitar hero Kenny Wayne Shepherd pulled him onstage for a jam session during his set at the Galaxy Theatre (Santa Ana, CA) in 1996.

Eric opened up for acts such as Buddy Guy, Jimmie Vaughan, and Jonny Lang. He had a developmental record deal with Steve Vai's label Favored Nations at 15.
