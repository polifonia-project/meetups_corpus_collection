== Biography ==
Born of Czech parents in 1973, Andrea Keller grew up in Sydney, Australia.
Convinced from a young age that she would be a musician, she studied piano, flute and saxophone at Sydney's Conservatorium High School. Inspired by her older brother, she penned her first compositions at the age of 10, and received her AMusA with distinction on piano at age 14. It was around this time that she was introduced to jazz music and the art of improvisation.
Continuing to explore classical, jazz and original musics throughout her teenage years, her musical path became more defined when she moved to Melbourne in 1993 to attend the Victorian College of the Arts.
Since 1996 Keller has been an active educator in Melbourne's tertiary jazz and improvisation departments, including the Faculty of the VCA and MCM University of Melbourne, Monash University and Melbourne Polytechnic (formerly NMIT).
