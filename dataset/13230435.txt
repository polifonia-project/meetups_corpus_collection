Chata (茶太, born November 21, 1979) is a Japanese singer who has performed theme songs for video games and anime series. She has also participated in various dōjin music circles. Her own private circle is called Usagi Kinoko.


== History ==
Chata began dabbling in music in 1998. She used to participate in writing lyrics on Niftyserve's forum for Original MIDI music. She has participated in many dojin music circles, mainly lending her vocals while for some she has voice-acted. At the same time she also releases works of her own under Usagi Kinoko, the circle she runs. She is the main vocalist for two dojin music circles, Idea (formerly known as Souleave) and My Sound Life. In March 2007, she collaborated with composer Yoko Shimomura and released her first major debut album, Murmur. In the same year, she performed the ending theme for the anime television series Potemayo, which first broadcast in July.
Chata is known for her sweet, whisper-like voice. She is close friends with dojin musicians Rekka Katakiri and Haruka Shimotsuki, and they have collaborated on many occasions. They once formed the group Shimochamin, and from December 2006 to June 2007 the three of them hosted the internet radio show Harechatta Utatane Biyori. She, Rekka and Haruka have all performed on the Ar tonelico Hymmnos Musical – Side Cocona.
