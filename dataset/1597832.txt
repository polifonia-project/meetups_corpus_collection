Dahlgren was discovered by musician/producer Bruno Glenmark in 1978 after appearing on the TV show Sveriges magasin and her debut album Finns det nån som bryr sej om was released the same year. In 1979 she placed third in Melodifestivalen (the tryout competition for the Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden).

Dahlgren's career grew steadily with several album releases during the 1980s but her definite breakthrough in Sweden came in 1991 with En blekt blondins hjärta, her most successful album, which sold over half a million copies and won her five Grammis awards.Dahlgren composed the score for the film Ingrid Bergman: In My Own Words (2015).


== Personal life ==
In 1996 Dahlgren made headlines in the Swedish press when she came out as a lesbian through her civil union with jewellery designer Efva Attling, whom she met when she moved to Stockholm in the early 1980s. In connection with the civil union, Dahlgren changed her surname to Dahlgren-Attling. In 2009 they went through a marriage ceremony, after Sweden passed its gender neutral marriage law.
