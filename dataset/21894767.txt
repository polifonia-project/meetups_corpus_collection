David played guitar and piano; Robin guitar, mandolin, and electric violin. The partnership lasted until 1990. The Washington Posthas described the duo as "an irresistible amalgam of melodic, sensual pop, folkie grit and killer wit." They appeared together, composing and performing throughout New England in various clubs, including The Bottom Line.
David performs with his partners, Rob Carlson and George Wurzbach in the group "Modern Man â€“ filling the void between The Three Tenors and The Three Stooges." "With the release of their third CD, "Assisted Living," the somewhat musical group known as Modern Man continued its assault on the out-moded idea that only those persons not yet manifesting symptoms of Alzheimer's should perform in public."From 2005 to 2014, Buskin rejoined his former partner, Robin Batteau and percussionist Marshal Rosenberg.  They created a new CD and toured as "Folk du Soleil."  In April, 2014, Robin announced his retirement from performing, but reunited with Buskin starting in 2019 [1].
