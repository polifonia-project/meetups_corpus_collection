Richard John Williams (born February 1, 1950) is an American guitarist and songwriter, primarily known for being one of the only consistent original members of the American rock band Kansas, alongside  drummer Phil Ehart. Both have appeared on every Kansas album.

Williams shared guitar duties with keyboardist/guitarist Kerry Livgren until 1984 when Kansas first broke up, and later from 1990-1991 as well as 1999-2000. From 1985-1991, he shared guitar-playing with Steve Morse, and later with Zak Rizvi from 2016-2021. Since April of 2021, Williams has served as the bands only dedicated guitarist, as he also did from 1991-1999, and 2000-2016. David Ragsdale will sometimes serve as a second guitarist when the band plays songs with little or no violin, such as "Portrait (He Knew)", "Fight Fire With Fire", and "Carry On Wayward Son".

Among the songs he co-wrote with the band are "Can I Tell You", "No Room for a Stranger", and the hit "Play the Game Tonight".
