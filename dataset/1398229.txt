At age 19, Black was discovered by Warner/Chappell Music who immediately signed her. Shortly after, she was courted by Universal Music Canada where she was offered a deal to help propel her career. Black capitalized on these opportunities, which saw her garnish her first Juno Award nomination in 1997 and continue to be nominated almost every year thereafter as well as having the opportunities to collaborate with and/or write for other well-known artists such as Nas, Destiny's Child, Sean Paul, Kardinal Offishall, and many others.Black had a Top 40 hit on the Canadian charts with 1998's "Rally'n". Subsequent singles also charted, such as "You Changed" and "Between Me and U". In the same year, she was invited to contribute to Rascalz' groundbreaking hip hop single, "Northern Touch", but was unable to participate due to other commitments. In 1999, she appeared on 2Rude's single "Dissin Us", which won the MuchMusic Video Award for Best R&B/Soul Video in 2000.Black's debut album was originally scheduled for release in 2014 on MCA Records, under the title I Traveled. however, was shelved after MCA folded that same year.

Also in the same year, Black played the Preacher in the theatre production of "Da Kink in My Hair" at the Princess of Wales Theatre in Downtown Toronto. The play was a critical success as it sold out all of its 106 performances, being extended 5 times. This led to the weekly TV series on the Global Television Network, with Black singing the opening theme and featured two episodes.
In Summer 2007, her new single, "Seven Day Fool", was released, becoming Black's first Top 10 hit in Canada. Her second album, Revival, was released on October 16, 2007, and was awarded the Juno for R&B/Soul Recording of the Year, where she performed the song live.
