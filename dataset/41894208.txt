Cooter Brown (born in Tampa, Florida) is an American country music singer. Brown's debut single, "Pure Bred Redneck", was released by Reprise Records in November 1995. It peaked at number 71 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. Deborah Evans Price of Billboard gave the song a negative review, writing that "there is nothing wrong with Brown's vocals, they would just sound much better wrapped around a good song." A version of the song with Jeff Foxworthy was included Foxworthy's 1996 album Crank It Up: The Music Album.
