=== Early life and career beginnings ===
Evans was raised in Stockbridge, Georgia. After graduating from Stockbridge High School, he began his career as a professional drummer for the band Marching Two-Step, which included Michele Rhea Caplinger, Ed Roland and Matt Serletic. The band performed local gigs for a few years, but never managed to grow beyond the club scene.


=== Collective Soul ===
Evans performed on half of the tracks featured on Hints Allegations and Things Left Unsaid, an album consisting of Ed Roland's songwriting demos. He remained in the band for the albums Collective Soul, Disciplined Breakdown, Dosage, Blender, and Youth. After the release of Youth, session drummer Ryan Hoyle had filled in for Evans on sporadic dates. The band then recorded the EP From the Ground Up in 2005; however, at the end of the year, Evans was dismissed from the group due to excessive drug use. He eventually got sober and joined his former band on stage at the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in September 2009.
