Tommy Giles Rogers (born December 30, 1980 in Morganton, North Carolina) is an American musician, most notable for being the lead vocalist, keyboardist and lyricist of the American progressive metal band Between the Buried and Me, which he co-founded in 2000.

Although he intended to be their guitar player at first, the band could not find a vocalist which prompted him to take that role. After acquiring a full lineup, Between the Buried and Me released their three-song demo and then their self-titled debut album in 2002. In 2004, Rogers released a self-titled debut album for his electronica side project, named Giles. Rogers was one of the vocalists for the metal band From Here On and has appeared in numerous other musical projects, including the metal band Undying. He was part of a clothing line and a small musical duo project with Jacob Troth that is known as Jacob Rogers.

His other solo albums are Modern Noise, released November 25, 2014, Velcro Kid, released November 4, 2016, and Don't Touch the Outside, which was released on November 9, 2018 via Sumerian Records.
