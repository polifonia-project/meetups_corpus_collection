== Career ==


=== Singing and live performance ===
Whitley was born in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. He began his singing career in New York City in 1930. He had traveled to New York where he became a construction worker on the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge. While working as a steelworker, he heard of an audition at a local radio station.  He was hired as a pop singer and learned a few chords on a guitar to back himself.  Soon he was backed by professional musicians, including the Frank Luther Trio.   He formed "The Range Ramblers" and began to broadcast on WMCA. He then traveled with the World's Championship Rodeo organization, under the ownership of Colonel Johnson, renaming his band "Ray Whitley and The Six Bar Cowboys." Whitley was skilled in the use of the stockwhip and could remove a cigarette from a man's lips with a single stroke, using either hand.Whitley recorded for several record labels, including Okeh, Apollo Records and Decca.


=== Development of the Gibson SJ-200 ===
In 1937, Whitley had worked with Gibson on the production of the Gibson SJ-200 acoustic guitar, which was initially known as the "Super Jumbo". Whitley used his own time and money to design a guitar, which he took to Gibson. He explained the features and merits of the instrument, suggesting that by presenting them to other stars of the day, would result in really putting the Gibson name on the musical instrument map. As a result, Whitley was the first performer to own a Gibson SJ-200. The first SJ-200, custom built by Gibson for Whitley, is on display in the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum.  The SJ-200 has since become an American icon, and has been played by hundreds of different guitarists over the years.


=== Motion pictures ===
In 1938, Whitley was signed to RKO Pictures and made 59 movies, over 20 of them short western musicals where he played the lead role.In the late 1950s, Whitley made appearances on the Roy Rogers TV specials, he also appeared in the feature film Giant starring Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, and James Dean.
Whitley wrote the original western tune Back in the Saddle Again. The song was first performed by the author, Ray Whitley, in the western movie Border G-Man, in which he played the part of "Luke Jones.” Gene Autry heard it and bought the song for a reported $200, making it his theme song.  Whitley and Autry changed the order of the verse and chorus, and made a very slight change in the melody, resulting in the present popular version. It is one of the most recognized and recorded Western music tunes in history.
