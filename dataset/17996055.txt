Ricotti was born in London, England, into a musical family and took up percussion, following his father who was a drummer. He came to the attention of teacher Bill Ashton who encouraged him to extend his studies. Ashton embarked on a project that eventually became the National Youth Jazz Orchestra. Ricotti concentrated on the vibraphone and developed his talents as a composer and arranger, playing in the NYJO while a teenager and then attending Trinity College of Music between 1967 and 1970.
