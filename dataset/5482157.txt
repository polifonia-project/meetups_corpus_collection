Having established a reputation with the Kweskin Jug Band during the 1960s, Geoff and his then wife Maria Muldaur recorded their first album, Pottery Pie, for Warner Bros. Records in 1968. this album contained his version of "Brazil" ("Aquarela do Brasil"), which became the theme for the film Brazil (1985) directed by Terry Gilliam. After recording the album, the Muldaurs moved to Woodstock, New York. They separated in 1972, shortly after Geoff Muldaur joined Paul Butterfield's Better Days band.
After leaving the Butterfield band in 1976, Muldaur recorded an album with Amos Garrett, and Geoff Muldaur and the Nite Lites for Hannibal Records. He also recorded with Bobby Charles, Jerry Garcia, Eric Von Schmidt, Bonnie Raitt, and John Cale. In the early 1980s, Muldaur left the stage and recording studio for a working sabbatical. He wrote scores for film and television, won an Emmy Award, and produced albums for Lenny Pickett and Richard Greene. In 2003, Deutsche Grammophon released his album, Private Astronomy: A Vision of the Music of Bix Beiderbecke. In 2009, Muldaur formed Geoff Muldaur and the Texas Sheiks with Stephen Bruton, Cindy Cashdollar, Suzy Thompson, Johnny Nicholas, and Bruce Hughes. Bruton died in 2009, and Tradition & Moderne released the album Texas Sheiks.
