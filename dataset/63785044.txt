Stefania Serafin (born December 30, 1973) is a professor at the Department of Architecture, Design and Media technology at Aalborg University in Copenhagen.


== Education ==
Stefania Serafin completed her master's degree in acoustics, computer science and signal processing applied to music, from IRCAM (Paris) in 1997. Following, she received her PhD in computer-based music theory and acoustics from Stanford University in 2004.


== Career ==
In 2018, Stefania Serafin was employed as professor at the Department of Architecture, Design and Media technology at Aalborg University in Copenhagen. Before becoming a professor Serafin worked as an associate professor and lecturer, also at Aalborg University. As a researcher, her focus lies on sound models and sound design for interactive media and multimodal interfaces.Serafin holds the position as president of the organization, Sound and Music Computing Network, which is a portal for the sound and music computing community. Also, she is the project leader of ‘The Nordic Sound and Music Computing Network (NordicSMC)’, which is a university hub for sound and music computing lead by the fields internationally leading researchers from the Nordic countries.
