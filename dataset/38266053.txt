== Early life ==
Wills was born in Edmonton, Alberta to teenage parents, and was put up for adoption when he was 18 months old. He was soon adopted and raised by a family from Calgary, Alberta. Wills grew up with his adoptive parents and their biological daughter in Oakridge, a southwest Calgary community. Although Wills had an interest in music during his childhood and teenage years, his adoptive family wasn't musical, so he spent more time focusing on athletics like skateboarding and hockey.When Wills was 18, he registered with an adoption registry with the hopes of being able to connect with his biological family.Wills began to get into music while on a backpacking trip through Australia in the late 1990s. At an open mic night, Wills' friend bet him $20 that he wouldn't go on stage and sing a song with the band. Wills accepted the bet, sang "The Dance" by Garth Brooks, and received an overwhelmingly positive reaction from the crowd. Wills then decided that he wanted to begin to focus on music, and learned to play guitar while still in Australia.When Wills returned home from his travels, he discovered that his biological mother had also registered with the adoption agency, and that she was requesting contact with him. When Wills was 20 years old, he met his birth parents and his five biological siblings, and found that there was a big musical streak in his birth family.

While in Nashville, Wills began working with producers Mike Pyle and Walt Aldrige, who helped him develop his craft.Wills released his debut album, Man with No Past, independently in 2010. It produced four singles, including "A Little More Time", which made it onto the Billboard Country Top 40 Chart.In 2012, Wills signed with On Ramp Records.

=== Artistry ===
Wills' music is stylistically diverse – while it's rooted in a classic country sound, some of his tracks have rock influences, some have more of a funk appeal, and others are reminiscent of 70's and 80's country crossovers. Wills cites Garth Brooks, George Strait, Keith Whitley, Waylon Jennings, Lefty Frizzel, and Merle Haggard among his musical influences. He believes he got his passion for country music from his adoptive father, who was a big country music fan and listened to country music frequently at home while Wills was growing up.

Wills is a committed humanitarian who acts as an Ambassador for the Adoption Council of Canada. He also supports the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, and during the 2014 Golden Globe awards weekend, he gave a charitable performance at the Oh Canada Cocktail Party to support the Friends of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.
