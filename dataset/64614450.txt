== Early life ==
Despite being born in Seoul, Kim has spent a little of his childhood in Saudi Arabia due to his dad's job.

In February 2016, he graduated from Hanlim Multi Art School and enrolled into Daekyeung University's Model Department. His mom initially didn't want him to become an idol and wanted him to be a normal student like everyone else, but he insisted on giving him a chance.
He started dreaming of becoming a singer and a dancer watching performances of Big Bang and J.Y. Park when he was little. He was especially interested in dance, and started dancing when he was 14, joining the Body & Soul crew: with them, in 2010, he won second place at the national competition Adrenaline House Dance Battle. While attending the first year of middle school, he took part in the Hidden Performing Arts Tournament, where he danced to Beast's "Shock". His older brother filmed the performance and posted it to Cyworld, where the footage caught the attention of Kim's cousin, a dance teacher, who invited him to join her dance school. Another teacher at that school was a dance instructor for JYP Entertainment, and this led him to an audition for the label. He became a trainee in 2011.
