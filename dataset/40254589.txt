== Early life ==
Kelley was born on August 26, 1985 in Ormond Beach, Florida, and is the son of Ed and Mary Margaret Kelley. Growing up, Kelley enjoyed sports and writing and spent most of his time playing baseball or at the beach.  As he got older he started to spend more time writing music and leading worship at his church. He also developed a strong love for playing guitar. When he was in his teens, his sister began to introduce him to country artists by playing him tapes on the way to the beach in exchange for Kelley washing her car. By the time Kelley was ready to graduate from Seabreeze High School in 2004 and Daytona State College in 2007, he was splitting his time between baseball (playing college baseball at Daytona State College and Florida State University and being scouted by the pros) and writing music. However, when he was doing more bench sitting than playing, he filled the void with writing. He later decided to move to Belmont University.
