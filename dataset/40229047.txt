On his 2nd solo album Golden Xplosion (2011), receiving rave reviews from The Guardian, Telegraph and Irish Times in addition to Danish Magazine, Jazz Special and Norway's Jazznytt. The critique Ian Patterson of The Guardian comments in his review of Golden Xplosion: "Marius Neset, the 25-year-old Norwegian saxophonist who surfaced in the UK last year with Django Bates (his teacher and mentor at Copenhagen's Rhythmic Music Conservatory), not only combines Brecker's power and Jan Garbarek's tonal delicacy, but has a vision that makes all 11 originals on this sensational album feel indispensable, and indispensably connected to each other. Bonuses include an inspired Bates on piano and synths, and the formidable Phronesis rhythm section of bassist Jasper Høiby and drummer Anton Eger."In 2012 Neset collaborated with the violinist Adam Bałdych on the album Imaginary Room within "The Baltic Gang", including Jacob Karlzon (piano), Lars Danielsson (double bass), Morten Lund (drums) & Verneri Pohjola (trumpet). The third solo album Birds (2013) was called "a heady concoction that surprises at every turn and enthralls in its stirring ensemble passages and epic scope", by the All About Jazz reviewer Ian Patterson. Here Neset is accompanied by Ivo Neame (piano), Jim Hart (vibraphone), Jasper Høiby (upright bass), Anton Eger (drums), Ingrid Neset (flute & piccolo flute), Daniel Herskedal (tuba), Bjarke Mogensen (accordion), Tobias Wiklund (trumpet), Ronny Farsund (trumpet), Peter Jensen (trombone) and Lasse Mauritzen (French horn). The reviewer of NRK Jazz states: "He abolishes the border between jazz and symphonic music and elevates thus both genres to unprecedented heights. He signed up for the label ACT Records in 2013. His first ACT release "Lion" (2014) together with the "Trondheim Jazz Orchestra" reached international acclaim as one of the most important large ensemble albums of 2014.
