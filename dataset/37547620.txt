== Early life ==

Maron then went to the University of California, Santa Barbara as a chemical engineering major. He decided to switch his major to computer science midway through his freshman year, based on his interest in video games. After the first quarter of his sophomore year, he dropped out. In December 2011, he made YouTube his full-time job.


== Career ==
Maron owns a total of eleven YouTube channels. Four of his channels are currently active. On February 9, 2010, he created his first channel titled ProsDONTtalkSHIT (PDTS) where he primarily uploaded gameplay videos of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. When PDTS began to become more popular, Maron decided he wanted a less vulgar name. He created a new channel named CaptainSparklez on July 20, 2010, and left PDTS inactive. Nearly two years later in April 2012, the CaptainSparklez channel reached 1 million subscribers on YouTube. In September 2013, CaptainSparklez reached 1 billion video views, becoming the fifth solo YouTube gaming channel to reach the milestone behind PewDiePie, SkyDoesMinecraft, UberHaxorNova and TobyGames.On May 15, 2015, he created a channel called CaptainSparklez 2, where he uploaded unedited Twitch live streams and videos and other content he felt did not belong on his main channel. On March 27, 2016, he created Maron Music, a music promotion channel where he would share other artists' music, as well as his own original music. On February 9, 2017, Maron created a dedicated channel for personal vlogs. Maron later created "Fortnite Cinema", a channel which featured short films created in the game Fortnite Battle Royale.
In early 2017, Maron began to upload videos featuring his reactions to top Reddit posts to his main channel. These reaction videos gained popularity, but Maron ultimately decided they were not what his core audience enjoyed watching. As a result, Maron created a new channel called Jordan Reacts on August 11, 2018, where he continued to upload Reddit reaction videos, and refocused on making Minecraft videos for his main channel. Maron's next channel is Jordan Games, where he uploads gameplay videos that would be irrelevant on his main channel. His newest channels are Jordan Lifts, featuring him lifting weights in his home gym, and SparkleShorts, containing small shots from various videos from the CaptainSparklez YouTube and Twitch channels.
Maron was featured in the 2016 Forbes 30 Under 30 list. In June 2016, he made an appearance in the sixth episode of Minecraft: Story Mode.


=== XREAL ===
Maron started a mobile gaming company called XREAL with Howard Marks, co-founder and former CEO of Activision and co-founder of Acclaim Games and StartEngine. XREAL released their game Fortress Fury in May 2015, which received over 1.5 million downloads within its first month of launch. Fortress Fury was originally titled Fortress Fallout; however, ZeniMax Media, parent company of Bethesda Softworks, known for the Fallout series, sent a cease and desist letter which requested that XREAL "immediately expressly abandon the application for Fortress Fallout and cease any and all current or proposed use of any mark incorporating the term Fallout." The letter was sent to prevent competition in the mobile game market for their game Fallout Shelter. Maron and the XREAL's legal team were not informed of this, because Bethesda kept Shelter a secret at the time and did not reveal its existence until its release on June 14, 2015.
