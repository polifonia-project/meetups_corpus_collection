== Stiff Records and Beyond ==
Robinson co-founded Stiff Records in August 1976 with his business partner Jake Riviera, with a £400 loan from the Dr. Feelgood lead singer Lee Brilleaux.

Later Robinson admitted that the merger was a mistake. He said "Island was in a bad financial state and I spent too much time worrying about his label and not enough about my own. I had a big hand in the success of Legend, the Bob Marley compilation; U2 went multi-platinum; and I had a lot to do with the marketing of Frankie Goes to Hollywood. (Chris) Blackwell (the founder of Island Records) kind of double-crossed me after I'd essentially saved his arse". Stiff again became an independent again after the demerger, however by 1986 Stiff had gone into liquidation and was sold to ZTT records for £300,000By 2004, Robinson had established Shell Records to be able to release Best Laid Plans by Sandra McCracken. He was a director of the label for just 6 days, from 7 May 2004 until 12 May 2004.
