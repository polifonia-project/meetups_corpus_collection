=== Early life ===
Theimer was born in 1946 in the village of Sankt Johann in Tirol in the State of Tyrol, Austria. His parents managed a retreat camp in the Austrian Alps for children from the nearby city of Innsbruck. In the farm-like setting, Theimer's earliest exposure to music included singing folksongs around the campfire, while hiking, and at evening gatherings.
Theimer began taking piano lessons at age four in the village of St. Johann, about an hour's walk down the mountainside every other week.


=== Education ===
Theimer was accepted into the training choir of the Vienna Boys’ Choir at age seven and joined one of the touring choirs at age nine. He was a member of the choir until age 14. During those years he toured Europe, South Africa, Rhodesia, Mozambique and, twice (1958 and 1960) the United States. The tour in 1958 included a concert at Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota.After completing his time with the boys’ choir, he finished his high school education (Realgymnasium) with the matura while also continuing his piano studies and singing with several choral groups in Vienna, including the Jeunesse Musicale and the Zusatzchor at the Vienna State Opera. After high school he was a student at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna until he moved to the United States to begin his tenure on the music faculty at CSB/SJU.

While living in Vienna, Theimer conducted the Chorus Viennensis, the adult performing partner ensemble to the Vienna Boys’ Choir, for two years. In 1969, SJU Men's Chorus director Gerhardt Track recommended Theimer to succeed him as the choral director at Saint John's University. Theimer arrived in Minnesota that summer.
Theimer has conducted the SJU Men's Chorus since joining the faculty at Saint John's University in 1969. In the same year, he also organized the first mixed choir for students of the College of Saint Benedict (a college for women) and Saint John's University (a college for men), which evolved into the CSB/SJU Chamber Choir, now one of the major touring ensembles of the combined CSB/SJU music department.In 1984 Theimer founded the Amadeus Chamber Symphony, a community chamber orchestra for central Minnesota musicians and audiences. The orchestra plays a full concert season each year and participates in annual Christmas at Saint John’s and other concerts involving CSB/SJU choral ensembles. The orchestra also hosts several community and youth partnership concerts each season.
Since 1988, Theimer has conducted Kantorei , a professional choir specializing in 19th- and 20th-century a cappella music from central Europe. The choir is known throughout the Midwest for its distinctively effortless sound, warm blend and expressive interpretation. It has been praised for reflecting the emotional content of both text and music. Kantorei presents concerts at churches in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul area and collaborates with schools as a part of its “Singing for a Lifetime” educational outreach program. Kantorei has been featured on Classical Minnesota Public Radio (KSJN), A Prairie Home Companion, and Twin Cities Public Television, and has produced five CD recordings. While its main repertoire is a cappella choral music, Kantorei has collaborated with the Minnesota Orchestra, Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, Minnesota Sinfonia and Minnesota Chorale during its 22 seasons. Kantorei is not affiliated with the choir of the same name based in Denver, Colorado, or the boys’ choir of the same name based in Rockford, Illinois.Since 2000, Theimer has been music director of the National Catholic Youth Choir, a choir for Roman Catholic high school students from across the United States that meets each summer at Saint John's University.Theimer has conducted all-state choirs, choral festivals, and honor choirs throughout the United States, Canada and Asia, and has presented master classes, workshops and seminars for state, regional and national music conventions and conferences, including ACDA, MENC, VCDA (Virginia Choral Directors Association) Senior Honors Choir Director  MMEA, OKMEA, and NPM.
