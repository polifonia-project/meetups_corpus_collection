In 2014, Baka was arrested and charged with forcing a 22-year-old woman into prostitution and taking her money. In 2015, he pleaded guilty to assaulting the woman and an unrelated weapons charge. He was sentenced to six months, but since he had already done 10 months in custody, he did not serve an additional six months.The woman refused to testify so they had to drop the charges for procuring prostitution and human trafficking. She was working as an escort and had an on-and-off relationship with Baka. She moved from Toronto by the time the trial was underway.Baka has priors for armed robbery, assault, discharging a firearm while committing a robbery, and possession for the purpose of trafficking. Upon his release, Drake said: "When [he] got out of jail there was a lot of different paths he could've took and he decided to focus on music."
