== Career ==


=== Faktion: 2002–2010 ===

In 2002, after attending the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas, Dutton met Josh Franklin, Jeremy Coan and Jeremy Moore; together the four-piece band formed Faktion. Originally Dutton was the lead singer until the band later recruited a fifth member, Ryan Gibbs to come in and be lead singer; Marshal then took over as lead guitarist for the band. Dutton recorded and released his first EP with the band titled "Make a Dent" in 2004, the EP attracted the attention of Roadrunner Records and the band was signed to their label in October 2004. A reunion is in the works which will showcase new songs. In addition, you can count on: Jeremy Blackstock's patented come hither (sunglasses pulled slightly down while making eye contact with the camera), signature look on drums; a shorter haircut, 6'4", Josh Franklin on guitar; Marshal "Wolfie" Dutton on lead guitar, vocals, and howling; Rounding it out with new dog owner, vocal genius/savant, Ryan Gibbs.


=== Hinder: 2009; 2012; 2015–present ===

In 2009 Dutton began helping write and produce songs for Hinder's 2010 studio album All American Nightmare, shortly thereafter he founded Back Lounge Productions alongside Hinder's drummer Cody Hanson. Their cliental includes acts like "9 Left Dead" and "Right On Red". He was also featured as a producer and writeron their 2012 studio album Welcome to the Freakshow. On January 20, 2015, it was announced that Dutton was the new lead singer for Hinder via the band's social media sites. This came after Hinder announced in November 2013 that their former lead vocalist Austin Winkler left the band to pursue a solo career. The decision came after Hinder experimented with Nashville-based singer Nolan Neal in the summer of 2014 throughout the rest of the year, band stated Neal's voice was a little too country for their rock image and that Dutton was the perfect fit because he had been writing and producing for the band since 2009. Cody Hanson of Hinder stated that Dutton was right under their nose the entire time it just took them a little while to see he was the perfect fit.


=== Other work: 2012–present ===
Dutton also founded a country group with Jarrod Denton on lead vocals, although Denton and Dutton are listed as the only two members in the group. Cody Hanson from Hinder has been supplying drum work for the group.
Drankmore released their first single titled "Beer Pressure" on March 2, 2012.The group released their second single titled "You Got To Me" on October 26, 2012, they released a music video for the single and it did fair some pretty well radio success. Dutton once again in 2012 helped write and co-produce Hinder's Welcome to the Freakshow album.
In October 2019 Dutton announced a new side band along with Hinder band-mate Cody Hanson titled "Dangerous Hippies". The side project will be used to release unreleased tracks that didn't make the Hinder records.
