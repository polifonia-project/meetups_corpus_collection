== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Johnson was exposed to music at the very early age of 2. Beginning with his father, Les Johnson, who was a Birmingham promoter for such bands as New Order, Killing Joke and New Model Army.
At the age of 5, Johnson started to join his father on tour with the band he managed The Wonder Stuff.  Johnson was then given his first pair of drumsticks by Martin Gilks and would often even get to soundcheck the drums. '"All my life I've been around music. I'd go to shows and soundcheck the drums for the Wonder Stuff and get to play kits on these big stages during soundcheck and hearing the sound of a drumkit through a PA I thought, 'Man I really want to do this!'"', says Johnson. With the support of his parents, at the age of 6, Johnson started taking drum lessons.


=== Beat Union ===
Beat Union was a pop-punk band from Birmingham, Bromsgrove and Redditch. They were formerly known as Shortcut to Newark. The group has garnered comparisons to Elvis Costello and The Jam, as well as pop punk groups like Green Day.
In 2006 the band toured the UK with Bedouin Soundclash and Zox. Their debut full-length album, Disconnected, was released on Science Records in April 2008. It was produced with the help of John Feldmann, producer and frontman of Goldfinger. Rolling Stone named their song "She Is the Gun" Song of the Day on 17 July 2008. The song also received rotation on BBC Radio 1, where it rose to No. 5 on the station's airplay charts.
After releasing the album, the group toured with Goldfinger and then played the 2008 Warped Tour in the U.S. A U.S. fall tour was announced with Flogging Molly, followed by UK dates with Less Than Jake.


=== Lostprophets (2009–2013) ===
Following the departure of American drummer Ilan Rubin from Lostprophets, Johnson was officially announced as the band's new drummer in August 2009, after they had completed the recording of their fourth studio album The Betrayed. The album was released in January 2010, and Johnson toured with them in support of the album, commencing in February 2010 with their UK tour in which they were supported by Kids in Glass Houses, Hexes, We Are the Ocean and Sharks.

He was replaced by former Kids in Glass Houses drummer Phillip Jenkins as their touring drummer.
