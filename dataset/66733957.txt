To hone her skills, Aikawa would often read aloud and made it part of her daily routine.While in junior high school, Aikawa wanted to join her school's basketball club due to her and her father's interest in the sport, but instead joined a club where she practiced using English, which she felt would help her improve her acting skills. Her family initially pushed her to pursue a career as a doctor, but permitted her plans to audition as a singer or voice actress. She applied for an audition held by the talent agency Music Ray'n, and after a series of screenings, participated in a training camp where the finalists would be chosen.
