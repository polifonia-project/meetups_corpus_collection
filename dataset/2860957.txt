== Comments on torture ==

In Spin's December 2006 issue, the magazine confronted Benton with information regarding his music being used as a torture and interrogation method at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In response Benton said, "People assume we should be offended that somebody in the military thinks our song is annoying enough that, played over and over, it can psychologically break someone down ... I take it as an honor to think that perhaps our song could be used to quell another 9/11 attack or something like that." He later added: "If they detain these people and the worst thing that happens is they have to sit through a few hours of loud music - some kids in America pay for that ... It doesn't seem all that bad to me."On December 13, 2008, Benton issued an apology on Drowning Pool's MySpace page about these comments on musical torture, stating his comments had been "taken out of context".
