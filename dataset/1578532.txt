Nicholas Lofton Hexum (born April 12, 1970) is an American singer, songwriter and rapper, currently the vocalist and guitarist for the multi-platinum alternative rock band 311 and The Nick Hexum Quintet.


== Early life ==
Born in Madison, Wisconsin, to father Dr. Terry Hexum and mother Pat, Hexum went to Westside High School in Omaha, Nebraska. There he played in the school's concert jazz band, and played in several local bands like "The Extras", "The Eds", "The Right Profile". In the 1988, Nick moved to Los Angeles to pursue music with his band "Unity", including Chad Sexton, Ward Bones, Marcus Watkins. This group split ways. Nick moved to Germany for a brief stint in 1990 when he got a call from Chad. He was back in Omaha and his band "Fish Hippos" had a gig with Fugazi and invited Nick to join the band. Nick agreed, but said they needed to change the name of the band. At that show, they announced from stage that their name was 311.

311 began playing together in 1990. Hexum was considered the bands default manager and did the legwork of organizing the band's schedule. He took out a student loan and used the money to get time at Rainbow Studios in Omaha to record their first independent album Dammit! released under his own record company called "What Have You Records". The band released three albums, Dammit!, Unity, and Hydroponic. In 1992, the band felt they'd done all they could on the local scene and moved out to Los Angeles to pursue a record deal. They signed to Capricorn Records.
Since then, 311 has released 13 major label records. They have performed over 2,000 shows in 27 countries and all 50 U.S. states. Hits include Amber, Down, You Wouldn't Believe, Creatures (For A While), and many more.


== Personal life ==
Hexum has three siblings: Angela, Zack and half-brother Patrick. His parents are divorced. Patrick died fighting an opioid addiction.Hexum was in a relationship with Nicole Scherzinger of The Pussycat Dolls from 2000 to 2004.
Hexum married his wife Nikki on New Year's Eve 2008 and they have three daughters. Their oldest daughter, Echo, was born in a home birth on August 29, 2009. Their second daughter, Maxine, was born May 1, 2011, also Nikki's birthday. Due to the absence of his family's midwife, Hexum performed the delivery.
