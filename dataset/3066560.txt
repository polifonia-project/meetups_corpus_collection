Lee Garrett (born June 30, 1943, in Mississippi) is an American rhythm and blues singer-songwriter, most famous for co-writing the song "Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours".


== Career ==
Garrett wrote several songs with Stevie Wonder, including the Jermaine Jackson song "Let's Get Serious" and The Spinners "It's a Shame".
In 1976, his solo track "You're My Everything" reached number 15 in the UK Singles Chart. Without any further chart presence, he became a one-hit wonder.Over the years, Garrett and Wonder have mended their relationship.  During his 2007 tour, during a performance on August 30, Wonder paid tribute to Garrett by singing a medley of songs they co-created, and also introduced Garrett to the audience by acknowledging his presence at the show, and thanking him for years of friendship and support.
Garrett resides in the Portland, Oregon area (in Beaverton, a city just west of Portland) and continues to perform throughout the United States. He is currently involved in the Ray Charles Tribute, which is a group of Northwest based musicians along with a 1950s style rock and roll and 1960s style R&B group called the Boomerband.
In 2007, Garrett formed a song writing partnership with Mir German of Miriams Well, a rock band based in Portland. German and Garrett had heard about each other from friends in Portland for some time, and were encouraged to meet to consider writing together. The partnership worked and they, along with co-writer Mark Bowden, created an album called Indians And Clowns, released in 2010. Their song catalogue is well over 60 songs to date.Garrett toured in 2011 with Miriams Well, sharing the stage for a set of Garrett's Motown hits and more contemporary tunes as well. They appeared together at the Waterfront Blues Festival in Portland in 2011.
Like Stevie Wonder, Garrett is also blind.
