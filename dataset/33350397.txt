== Music career ==


=== 1993–2002: Diversion ===
Diversion was Rene's first musical alliance; it was an alternative pop band based in Soquel, California (1994–2002) composed of Tas Szemeredi (vox/bass), Chris Rene (guitar/vox), and Mike Rene (drums). They were only 12 or 13 years old when they formed the band, but still performed at well-known venues such as the Red Room.
The group released a self-titled CD, Diversion, in 2000. The band recorded more tracks for a second album, but they broke up in early 2005 without being able to finish it.


=== 2003–2009: Solo career ===
The band continued working on music for their second album until 2005, but never saw the project through. After the split-up of the band, Rene began writing and recording music as an individual. He continued to work as a solo artist and in 2009 released the album Soul'd Out on an independent label.

His song "Young Homie" is "about learning how to be a grown-up," says Rene. "When you're young, you feel like there's no limit, no consequences to your actions. So it's me talking to my younger self and to all the young brothers out there, telling them that life's too beautiful to live like that." While the song contains a heavy subject, it is reflective of Rene's personal life.
Rene plays piano, guitar, bass, drums, among others. He began writing songs and playing guitar at age 12, teaching himself the pentatonic scale and beyond.
