== Early life ==
Anders Kobro was born in Kristiansand, Norway on 10 June 1975. Kobro began playing in a band called Green Carnation, which later changed its name into In the Woods, when he was 14.


== With Carpathian Forest ==
Anders Kobro's first collaboration with Carpathian Forest was the debut liveshow for the band at the Quart Festival 1998 in Kristiansand together with Immortal and Satyricon on the bill. Two weeks later Carpathian Forest played at Under the Black Sun festival in Germany. After these two shows Carpathian Forest agreed on continue the work together, so in October 1998 R. Nattefrost, J. Nordavind, Tchort and A. Kobro got together a Friday afternoon in Soundsuite studio with Terje Refnes and much alcohol. The result of that session was the 7-inch He's Turning Blue/Ghoul (Mayhem cover) featured on Tribute to Mayhem album released by Avantgarde Music. One year later the band again entered Soundsuite studio (with Terje Refsnes) and recorded the album Strange Old Brew, and Morbid Fascinations of Death also released on Avantgarde Music.
