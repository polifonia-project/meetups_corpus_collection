David Stout Stogner (May 15, 1920 – May 17, 1989) was an American musician, who was one of the premier Western swing musicians playing on the West Coast. Known as the "West Coast King of Western Swing", Stogner moved to California to pursue a musical career with the encouragement from fellow Texan, Milton Brown.Although famous for his long-time big band, The Western Rhythmaires, his first band was called The Arkansawyers. Dave Stogner and The Western Rhythmairs hosted a show at the Big Fresno Barn Dance for more than ten years.At least one author described Stogner's sound as "hard driving hillbilly".Throughout his long career, in addition to his many hit recordings, Stogner wrote, and co-wrote, several songs including "Hard Top Race" in 1953. Stogner was elected to the Western Swing Hall of Fame in Sacramento in 1988.
