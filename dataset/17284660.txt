Mitchell was raised in Syracuse, New York until age eight, when her family moved to Anaheim, California. Her first instruments were piano and viola, which she started playing in fourth grade. She was classically trained in flute and played in youth orchestras as a teenager.

In the early 2000s, she became a co-host for the Avant-Garde Jazz Jam Sessions in Chicago that were started by Boykin, bassist Karl E. H. Seigfried, and drummer Mike Reed.She issued her debut album Vision Quest with Black Earth Ensemble in 2001 on her label, Dreamtime Records.
