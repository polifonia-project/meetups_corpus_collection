== Early life ==

Later, his mother was relocated to Germany along with her new husband while Sfakianakis was visiting her and, at times, living with her. He raised in the island of Kos by his mother's relatives and others. His schooling ended after he finished the first grade of gymnasion (first year of lower secondary education). Notis became a disc jockey in his early 20s and helped support himself by working as a waiter and as well as with his brother-in-law (his sister's husband) as a staff in hands-on works of electrician, plumber and labourer.

In 2003, Sfakianakis had an operation on his vocal cords, leading to a two-year hiatus between his following albums, As Milisoun Ta Tragoudia, and Me Agapi O,ti Kaneis. His 2004 album Me Agapi O,ti Kaneis, sonically illustrates Sfakianakis' mourning for his brother Giorgos, who died of cancer. His mother Mairi (Despina) Laoumtzi died on 27 June 2020.

== North American tour (2009) ==
In November 2009, Sfakianakis undertook his first North American tour since 1999 when he was at the peak of his career. On this tour he performed in Atlantic City, NJ, Chicago, IL, and Canada. Many in the Greek community believe that this 10-year period between Sfakianakis' last US visit was due to politically oriented comments he made during a concert during his prior visit that caused some displeasure among Greek-Americans. However, during his 2009 concert in Atlantic City, Sfakianakis expressed his gratitude to the audience for their devotion and affection over the years and wished to give them a concert that "we will all remember after 10 years". Sfakianakis made good on his word, as the crowd gave him numerous ovations during the concert.


== Controversies and opinions ==
Sfakianakis' interviews with the press are always memorable and controversial. He has a reputation for being very outspoken and uses the press to air his opinions on various matters. When he has appeared on live television, he has drawn praise and criticism in equal measure. On the one hand, some have praised his disarming honesty and applauded him for addressing hard-hitting issues. On the other hand, he has been heavily criticised for being argumentative and confrontational; some critics claim he lacks the capacity to be diplomatic.
In the late nineties, Sfakianakis appeared in a television interview during which he argued that cannabis should be legalised in Greece. When asked if he had ever used the drug, Sfakianakis admitted that he had been habitually smoking cannabis for the last ten years. He argued that this substance is not any more harmful than legally distributed substances such as tobacco and alcohol – while pointing out that many fatal road accidents are due to alcohol abuse.Also in the same period, some publications were talking about tax evasion by him and other artists without providing documentation for their claims.He has been declared that one of Greece's greatest singers, Stelios Kazantzidis, used to have a "somewhat okay vocal ability" and play a role when singing, while claiming that he would never sing at the Greek Concert Hall, as he never would he visit a place that he dislikes  not mentioning if such a musical scene would invite him.
Most of the criticism he has raised is a result of his highly supportive statements towards the Greek far right, Golden Dawn, which he argues are not fascist. More analytically, he said that "everyone must support Golden Dawn because they're about the dawn while everything else is plain darkness" and objected to an elected political party's leader being imprisoned.
These declarations were the main reason for the discontinuance of his on-stage collaboration with Despina Vandi, a result of Vandi being deeply insulted, coming from an immigrant family.
