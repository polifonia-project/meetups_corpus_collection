Jochem George Paap (born 14 February 1969, in Rotterdam), known by his stage name Speedy J, is a Dutch electronic music producer based in Rotterdam. His breakthrough came with the release in 1992 of the minimal techno track "Pullover". He released music as part of Warp Records' Artificial Intelligence series in the 1990s, including his debut LP Ginger (1993).


== Career ==
His debut album Ginger (1993) was released on Richie Hawtin's Plus 8 record label in Canada, while in the UK it was part of Warp Records' Artificial Intelligence series of electronic listening music. A further, more introspective release, G-Spot, followed in 1995. A live album, !ive, was also released. Afterwards his work, which included Public Energy No.1 (1997) and A Shocking Hobby (2000) became more xperimental, importantly influencing the development of what is known as "IDM", or intelligent dance music.
In his dance music course on Masterclass, Armin Van Buuren cited Speedy J's Ginger album as being one of his major early influences.
"Upon first impressions, Public Energy No.1 highlights a big departure from previous Speedy J offerings... in a complete role reversal, it enters upon an iconoclastic electro territory more familiar to admirers of such other purveyors as Autechre, the Aphex Twin, Mike Paradinas and Martin Damm in his Steel persona," wrote Andrez Bergen in 1998 for Australian magazine Inpress.The album Loudboxer (2002) saw a return to a more minimal four to the floor style of techno. While the CD version of the album contains 15 tracks mixed together, the vinyl version instead contains 200 locked grooves.
He collaborated with Mike Paradinas on the project Slag Boom Van Loon, through which they have released two CDs on Paradinas's record label, Planet Mu. In 1999, he also released two ambient albums for the FAX +49-69/450464 label under his real name.
In 2008, he released his sound library/audio software, entitled Kreate by Jochem Paap. KREATE is released by Fixed Noise.
Also in 2008, Speedy J started releasing music on his own record label, Electric Deluxe, as well as records by Terence Fixmer, Gary Beck, Tommy Four Seven and others.
In 2013, Speedy J and Luca Mortellaro released a collaborative album under the name Zeitgeber. It was released on Mortellaro's label Stroboscopic Artefacts.
