C.V. Jørgensen  (born May 9, 1950) is a Danish music composer, guitarist and singer-songwriter.
C.V. Jørgensen sings exclusively in Danish. His songs are mellow and the lyrics are delivered in an inventive and laconic style. Some songs revolves around hypocrisy in society at large with a critical, sarcastic and satirical exposure of the philistines, while other songs deal with existential issues or paint surreal poetic images. His album "Tidens Tern" from 1980, was selected for the Danish Culture Canon in 2006.
