Matthew Swann,  performing under the name Astral Swans, is a Canadian singer-songwriter from Calgary, Alberta, signed to Dan Mangan's Madic Records, an imprint of Arts & Crafts Productions. His music style has been described as "introspective late 60s folk Ã  la Nick Drake filtered through an avant-garde 90s lens." His 2015 album, All My Favorite Singers Are Willie Nelson, was described by VICE as "a stark, beautiful project [...] steeped in 60s psych-folk mythology and loner punk iconography." His latest album, Strange Prison, was released in May 2018. Previously Matthew Swann was a member of Hot Little Rocket and  Extra Happy Ghost!!!
