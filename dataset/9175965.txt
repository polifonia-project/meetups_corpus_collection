In 2001 and 2002, he served as opening act for boy band NSYNC, which featured fellow Mickey Mouse Club co-stars Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez.

Come Around Again was released in 2008.
Lucca participated in a cooperative tour with Jay Nash and Matt Duke, which resulted in the 2009 EP entitled TFDI.  The collaboration, which stands for "Totally Fuckin' Doing It" was recorded in the Evanston, Illinois, studio SPACE during an impromptu visit to the studio, after the three artists formed a friendship during the tour. Lucca briefly returned to acting in 2010, starring in a 901 Silver Tequila commercial, which was directed by the brand's founder Justin Timberlake.

Lucca joined Patreon in 2013. On November 12, 2013, while plugging Patreon on his YouTube channel, Tony announced he is no longer with Adam Levine's record label 222 Records.  Excerpt: "Some of you know that recently I was signed to a fairly high profile record deal.  -Super cool.  What most of you don't know is that, said "record deal", has since come to an end.  -Not as cool. Your basic record business 101 really..."
Tony Lucca then moved to Nashville, Tennessee to further develop his songwriting. He funded his 2015 album Tony Lucca via crowd-funding platform Kickstarter, also releasing a corresponding collection of songs called Made To Shine – The Kickstarter Sessions. Lucca would later share that the 2015 album took a personal toll on him, like "going through a really bad breakup," and told Billboard that after the record he "was in no hurry to get back in the studio" but instead elected to co-write as many songs as he could with Nashville collaborators.In 2018, Lucca partnered with Nashville startup company RootNote and began work on his new record Ain't No Storm, which he recorded with Nashville-based producer and former Wilco drummer Ken Coomer.
