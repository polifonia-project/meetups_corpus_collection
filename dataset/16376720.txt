Taft Jordan (February 15, 1915 – December 1, 1981) was an American jazz trumpeter.


== Life and career ==
He was born in Florence, South Carolina, United States. Jordan played early in his career with the Washboard Rhythm Kings, before becoming a member of Chick Webb's orchestra from 1933 to 1942, remaining after Ella Fitzgerald became its leader. Jordan and Bobby Stark traded duties as the main trumpet soloist in Webb's orchestra. From 1943 to 1947, he played with Duke Ellington, then with Lucille Dixon at the Savannah Club in New York City from 1949 to 1953. After this he played less often, though he toured with Benny Goodman in 1958, played on Miles Davis's Sketches of Spain, and worked with the New York Jazz Repertory Company. He recorded four tunes as a leader in 1935, and led his own band in 1960–61 when he recorded albums for Mercury, Aamco Records, and Swingville.
