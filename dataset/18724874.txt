José Fernando Suárez (born October 15, 1980), known professionally as Cosculluela, is a Puerto Rican rapper, singer and songwriter. In 2018, he was caught up in a controversy after fellow Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA released a diss track.


== Early life and education ==
Cosculluela was born to a Cuban father and a Puerto Rican mother. He came from an upper-class family and was raised in the gated community of Palmas del Mar. At a young age, Cosculluela became interested in tennis and eventually played for his high school, Colegio San Antonio Abad. He also developed passions for golf and surfing.


== Career ==
At the age of sixteen, Cosculluela began producing underground mixtapes with his brother Jaime and his friends. After a few years of recording underground, popular Reggaeton producer Buddha found out about Cosculluela's talents in a San Juan studio. Buddha was working with Latin hip hop producer Echo at the time. Buddha selected Cosculluela to replace rapper Tempo in the hip hop group Buddha's Family. Echo eventually signed Cosculluela to his label, Invasion Music.
Cosculluela gained international recognition with the hit single "Te Va Ir Mal" (feat. Getto) from the album Buddha's Family 2 distributed by Machete Music/Universal Latino. Soon after, Cosculluela began working with famed producers Gocho and Alex Gargolas for multiple compilation albums. He also released a reworked version of his classic mixtape, "Este Es Mi Momento", in 2006.After this, Cosculluela moved up in the ranks of reggaeton, appearing on such albums as Los Bandoleros Reloaded, Invasion, Gargolas, Los Bravos, El Pentágono, El Pentágono: The Return, Los Brother, Talento de Barrio, and many more. Cosculluela is known to many as "El Principe del Verso" (The Prince of Verse) because of his exceptional lyrical abilities as an MC.
Echo was unable to get Universal Latino to release an album from any of his artists and only saw his compilation album "Invasion vol. 1" distributed. This caused Cosculluela to leave Invasion in 2007 and sign a recording contract with the renowned executive producer Elias De León and his influential record label White Lion Records. After struggling with record executives to set a release for his debut album, which was originally meant to be distributed on Sony Latin, and after various delays in 2009, Machete Music was pressured into releasing Cosculluela's hit debut album, "El Principe" (The Prince). It was released thanks to Cosculluela's friendship with Wisin y Yandel, who had a partnership with Universal Latino for their record label WY Records and were very influential at the company due to their immense success and popularity.

=== Blanco Perla ===
In 2014 Cosculluela left Universal Latino which lead to a bidding war among Latin labels to sign him, thanks to his success and much-publicized rap battle against Tempo. Warner Music Latina won the right to distribute Cosculluela's works through his Rottweilas Inc imprint and immediately began work on his latest album "Blanco Perla".  Cosculluela released the hit single "Baby Boo" featuring renowned hitmakers Wise "The Gold Pen" and DJ Luian to prepare for his upcoming release.Although he began 2015 with a domestic violence charge, he otherwise enjoyed major success that year. He released the smash hit "Te Busco" with Nicky Jam, the first single from his album Blanco Perla. In October 2016, he released the album, which features major hits such as "Te Busco", "Manicomio", and "La Boda", the latter of which is about his wedding, which occurred in November 2015; it features singer O'Neill as well as an intro by rapper Kendo Kaponi. The album also features collaborations with artists such as Daddy Yankee, Nicky Jam, Farruko, Arcangel, De La Ghetto, and Tempo.
Blanco Perla remains Cosculluela's most notable work in terms of popularity as the artist decided to leave behind his hardcore hip hop roots in favour of the modern mainstream reggaeton sound of artists such as J Balvin and Nicky Jam.  Hit singles from the album such as "Te Busco" feat. Nicky Jam, Manicomio, "La Boda", and "A Donde Voy" featuring Daddy Yankee have garnered hundreds of millions of plays through various streaming platforms and become some of the most well-known songs of Cosculluela's catalogue.


=== 2021 ===

== Controversy ==
On September 15, 2018, Anuel AA released a diss track aimed at Cosculluela. The track was widely criticized due to its foul language and offensive remarks about homosexuality and HIV patients.Two years later, amid the George Floyd protests around the world, the urban artist expressed through Instagram Live that Afro-Puerto Ricans are not descendants of Africa. This is contrary to the basic teachings of the Puerto Rican education system that educate on the history and colonization process of Puerto Rico which included the African slave trade that lasted almost 500 years, and the vast and evident African influence on Puerto Rican culture (along with European Spanish and indigenous Taíno influences). Although he did not clarify where he believed the Afro-Puerto Ricans are originally from, in his insulting expressions of June 7, 2020, he also called for Puerto Ricans to not join in on protests, calling the demonstrations a "crap that affects the economy". Later that day, the urban artist issued an apology.
