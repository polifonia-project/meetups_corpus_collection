David Cross (born 23 April 1949 in Turnchapel near Plymouth, England) is an English electric violinist and keyboardist best known for playing with progressive rock band King Crimson from 1972 to 1974. He appears on their studio albums Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Starless and Bible Black, and a single track on Red. Cross also appears on numerous other live recordings from 1973 & 1974 that have been released by Robert Fripp's Discipline Global Mobile label in the decades since, including  USA (1975) and  The Night Watch (1997).
After his time with King Crimson, Cross traveled extensively, eventually returning to music through work in the theatre. In 1987 he formed an ensemble called Low Flying Aircraft with Keith Tippett on piano. In 1988, he was invited by keyboardist Geoff Serle to join Radius, with whom he has recorded five studio albums.
Since the late 1980's, he has toured and recorded with his own eponymous band (see below). Over a 30 year period, the group has included saxophonist Pete McPhail, guitarists Paul Clark and Peter Claridge, bassists Simon Murrell, John Dillon (who also sang lead vocals) and Mick Paul, drummers Dan Maurer, Lloyd, Craig Blundell, Steve Roberts and Pat Garvey, keyboardists Sheila Maloney and Alex Hall, and lead singers Arch Stanton and Jinian Wilde. Former (and current) King Crimson musicians John Wetton, Robert Fripp and Pat Mastelotto, as well as former Crimson lyricists Peter Sinfield and Richard Palmer-James have all contributed to David’s albums.
Prominent session work includes recordings with Clearlight,  Jade Warrior and Tony Levin’s  Stick Men (with whom Cross toured).
Recently, Cross has released a series of duo recordings with Robert Fripp, Andrew Keeling, Andrew Booker (of No-Man),  David Jackson (formerly of Van der Graaf Generator) and Peter Banks (formerly of  Yes), the latter two including a full band.
Cross has composed music for theatre and worked as an actor as well. He runs his own record label, Noisy Records.
