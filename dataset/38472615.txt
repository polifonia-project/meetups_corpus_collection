=== Career beginnings ===
At the age of 7, under the supervision of her uncles, Brianna Perry made her first recording at the Poe Boy Music Group studios. Her frequent visits to the studio would accumulate the attention of rappers Trina and Trick Daddy, the former who would grant Perry a recording deal with Diva Records (Diva Enterprises/DP Entertainment). From there, Perry guest starred on BET's Rap City and made her rapping debut on Trina's Diamond Princess on the track "Kandi", which would attract the attention of Missy Elliott. Elliott would go on to sign Perry to her label, The Goldmind Inc., and feature the young rapper in various promotional concerts with her and Timbaland. Additionally, Perry would also make cameo appearances in a few of Elliott's work such as the music video to "Pass That Dutch" and her short-lived reality series, The Road to Stardom with Missy Elliott. In between cameo work, Perry would work extensively on an untitled debut album which tentatively comprised forty tracks and sole production from Elliott and Timbaland; however, the project was never released. In 2006, due to creative differences, Perry parted ways with Elliott on good terms.In 2007, Perry readied a mixtape, Princess of Miami, with Slip-N-Slide recording affiliates and former mentor Missy Elliott. In 2008, Perry announced work on a debut album tentatively titled Girl Talk, alongside a film project with Malcolm in the Middle actor Frankie Muniz, however neither project was released. In 2009, Perry was shuffled to Flo Rida's label International Music Group, where she materialized a mixtape, The Graduation, and an underground single, "Boom Shacka", that failed to serve as a commercial release.

In 2011, Perry departed from Flo Rida's camp and went on to do further work with longtime family label, Poe Boy Music Group. That same year, Perry released the single, "Fly Kicks", alongside an accompanying music video. Its visual premiere on BET's 106 & Park would earn her a contract deal with Atlantic Records, and accumulate enough buzz to compose the mixtape Face Off.
