Jim Krewson first played bluegrass in a group called the Slobber Mountain Boys; Jennie Bedford learned bluegrass from her father, a banjo player. The two first met in New York City in 1998 and began playing together with banjo player Brad Hutchison and bassist Brendan Skwire. They recorded their first album under the name Jim & Jennie and the Pine Barons, released in 1999; two further albums would follow on Overcoat Recordings before landing an album on Bloodshot Records in 2005, touring the US all the while (including dates with Neko Case) and encountering significant media exposure.
