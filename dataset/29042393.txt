When asked by Something Punk about the current status of Underminded, Wayne said that "Nick Martin (vocals) and I decided that we wanted Underminded to be an open thing forever. I don't think Underminded will ever die. We've talked about possibly putting together a record next year, but who knows. Underminded is an outlet for us to do whatever the fuck we want."

According to an interview with Decoy Music, Wayne actually came up with the name of the album and explained its origin, saying that "Brad, Brandon and I were sitting in Brad's house discussing album titles. Someone brought up illuminati and I randomly said Illuminaudio. It means finding the light/positivity through sound, which ended up being a big theme on the record." On March 27, 2012, Tanner announced via his blog that he was leaving Chiodos because "our personal and business relationships went to shit."
