With Williams' help, Thomas made chart-topping albums for the Hot Boys, which was composed of Lil Wayne, B.G., Juvenile, and Turk, producing all of the group's albums. He also produced all tracks on the members' solo works as well.Later, Thomas formed the Big Tymers along with Williams, as Mannie Fresh and Birdman respectively, bringing him fame, and released five albums.

In 2005, he split from Cash Money for financial reasons, and later joined Def Jam South, to which he is currently signed.
