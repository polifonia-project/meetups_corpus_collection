In 2001, Thomas began dating Usher, after she starred in his music videos for "U Remind Me" and "U Got It Bad". Their relationship lasted for two years: they broke up in December 2003, followed by a media frenzy surrounding the personal nature of Usher's fourth album, Confessions. His fans inferred the reason he and Thomas split is due to infidelity on his part, giving allusions to the lyrics of the songs. In an interview on The Bert Show on the Atlanta radio channel Q100 on February 17, 2004, Thomas claimed that Usher cheated on her: "Usher did the ultimate no-no to me....I will never be with him again, and that is that". Usher defended: "it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up".Rozonda credits Doug Bachelor and Amazing Facts on television for making a difference on her walk with God. She later met and talked to Doug Bachelor at the National Religion Broadcasters Convention in Nashville.
