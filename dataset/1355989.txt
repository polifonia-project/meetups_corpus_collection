== Career ==
Taylor was born in Livingstone Hospital, Dartford, and attended Dartford Grammar School. In July 1962, while he was at Sidcup Art College, the Rolling Stones was formed when Taylor, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards' three-piece group Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys joined Brian Jones and Ian Stewart's Rollin' Stones. Initially, Taylor played lead guitar in the band, but switched to bass to accommodate Jones, who quickly went on to become an accomplished slide guitarist. That November, Taylor left to return to art college, and his former bandmates posted an advertisement seeking another bassist. Bill Wyman responded, and succeeded him as the Rolling Stones' bassist in December 1962.
In 1963, Taylor formed the Pretty Things with vocalist Phil May, and once again played his preferred guitar position. He left the Pretty Things in 1969, after the release of their concept album S.F. Sorrow. The band released a few more albums without Taylor and disbanded in 1976, but regrouped with Taylor in 1979 to release Cross Talk. Taylor remained with the Pretty Things until they broke up in 2018.
In addition to his work with The Pretty Things, Taylor co-produced Hawkwind's debut album, on which he also played guitar, as well as Cochise's first album and Skin Alley's first album. His contribution to punk rock was a recording by Auntie Pus. During the second half of the 1980s, Taylor played guitar with the English post-punk band the Mekons. He recorded with Andre Williams in Chicago for George Paulus' St. George Records.
