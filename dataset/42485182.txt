== Life and career ==


=== 2011-2012: Career Beginnings and "Ima Read" ===
Originally from Washington, D.C., Jarvis moved to New York in 2000. Before entering the world of rap, Jarvis was a full-time student at Cooper Union. Jarvis' first experience with rap was on her best friend Ojay Morgan's 2012 single "Ima Read". The song was recorded in one night, directly into a computer microphone, and hasn't been re-recorded since. On January 18, 2012, the song manifested into a music video directed by Ruben XYZ and quickly became a viral underground sensation.

In Spring of 2013, Jarvis and Katz opened twice for Die Antwoord and toured European festivals through to the end of Summer. The duo later went on to open for the British leg of Azealia Banks's Fantasea tour in late 2012. "Ima read" also became the soundtrack for Rick Owens' and Alex Mattsson's Fall-Winter 2012/2013 and Fall-Winter 2013 collections, respectively.


=== 2013-present: Solo work and Needful Things ===
Following the unexpected success of "Ima Read", Jarvis began penning several songs under her Reddd Foxxx persona, releasing them periodically on her SoundCloud account. Jarvis' first solo song, "Silly Bitch", was released as a promotional single off her debut mixtape Class President, which has yet to be released. In September 2013, Jarvis was featured in a short film, modeling for British designer Kitty Joseph in association with Absolut Vodka. Jarvis' latest single "Watercolour" is used throughout the film. On December 15, 2013, Jarvis released her highly anticipated debut EP Needful Things, in collaboration with London-based producer Jepordise, to rave reviews. Jarvis is expected to release her first full-length mixtape The Wiz, which samples all of the songs featured in the 1978 feature film The Wiz, sometime later this year.
