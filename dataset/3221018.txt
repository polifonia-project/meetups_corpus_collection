Lucien Barbarin (July 17, 1956 – January 30, 2020) was an American trombone player. Barbarin toured internationally with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and with Harry Connick Jr.He made his debut at the age of six, playing drums in the Onward Brass Band, with his great-uncle Paul Barbarin.In New Orleans, Barbarin performed locally. After Hurricane Katrina severely damaged his home in 2005, he said: "I'm not running from New Orleans. [...] I'm going to stay because I was born and raised here and I'm going to pass away here." He died from prostate cancer on January 30, 2020. He was just 63 years old.
The cut from the CD Alone with My Faith from Harry Connick, Jr. is presumably dedicated to him.
