Jam Factory (Korean: 잼 팩토리; RR: Jaem Paektori) is a South Korean music publisher which sources song tunes and lyrics for K-Pop, J-Pop and Mandopop artists from songwriters predominantly based in the USA. Writers of the tunes are often songwriters for American companies, such as Brandon Fraley, a well known provider of tunes to South Korean girl and boy bands, who is a songwriter for Sony Music Publishing in Los Angeles. Korean, Japanese and Chinese language lyrics are usually provided by Jam Factory's own lyricists based in Seoul.As with the songwriters of America's Motown era Jam Factory's songwriters and lyricists may support a band's development over many years. For example, Girls' Generation songwriter team has included Korean lyricist Kim Hee-jeong for over 8 years, his lyrics growing with the band.
