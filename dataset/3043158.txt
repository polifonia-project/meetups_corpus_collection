David Carr of the New York Times said, “Ike Reilly is a kind of natural resource, mined from the bedrock of music. All the values that make rock important to people—storytelling, melody, rage, laughter—are part and parcel of every Ike Reilly show I have ever seen."

The band's 2007 album  We Belong to the Staggering Evening was described as "soulful, blues-tinged."

=== Crooked Love (2018) ===
On May 18, Reilly released "Crooked Love." Reilly told The Current, "I don't have an iron-clad mind, but I remember people, you know. Who they are and what they're about. And then I steal their souls and stories. I act like I like them. And then I suck everything I can out of them."


== Style and influences ==
Stated guitarist Tom Morello in June 2015, "In my view, he's one of the best American songwriters of the last 10 years, both in delivery and lyrics. It's, like, part Springsteen, part Replacements.
