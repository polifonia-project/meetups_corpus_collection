== Early life ==
Born John Stephen Sudduth in Louisiana, Mikky Ekko had a restless childhood as the son of a preacher, moving around America's deep south.  Having settled briefly in Tupelo, Mississippi, and absorbed as much gospel as he could, he relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, and started playing in bands. Ekko began working as a songwriter for other artists, but realized that he wanted to be a singer himself. He released his first EP Strange Fruit (produced by Tim Lauer) on February 15, 2009 containing the first songs he'd written by himself, most of them a cappella. Ekko says of Nashville:  "fortunate to be in a city that's so loving and hospitable." From September 2009, he toured with the Nashville-based collective group Ten Out of Tenn.
