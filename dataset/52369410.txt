== Biography ==
Nash Chambers is the first child of country musicians, Bill and Diane Chambers. Soon after his younger sister, Kasey, was born in 1976 the family travelled around the Nullarbor Plain, where their parents hunted foxes and rabbits for pelts during seven or eight months a year, spanning nine years. For summer holidays they returned to Southend, South Australia. From 1986 Bill and Diane began performing as a country music duo and added first Kasey and then Chambers to their act, which became the Dead Ringer Band.Chambers was recorded on two albums released by his father, Sea Eagle (1987) and Kindred Spirit (1991). In 1992 the family's group, Dead Ringer Band, became a full-time concern and they toured both rural and city venues. Chambers provided vocals, drums, acoustic guitar, harmonica and didgeridoo for the band. They released four albums, Red Desert Sky (1993), Home Fires (1995), Living in the Circle (1997) and Hopeville (1998), before disbanding. By that time his parents had separated. Chambers assisted Kasey's solo work starting with her first album, The Captain (May 1999), recorded late in 1998. He provided backing vocals, bass guitar and acoustic guitar as well as being her talent manager, record producer and audio engineer.At the ARIA Music Awards of 2007 he was nominated for Producer of the Year for Kasey's album, Carnival (August 2006).

During 2002 Chambers produced the debut solo album for Shane Nicholson (ex-Pretty Violet Stain), It's a Movie, including the track, "Designed to Fade", which is a duet with Kasey.
