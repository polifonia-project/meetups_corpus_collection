== Biography ==
Tomasiak was born on 6 June 1993 in Goleniów, Poland. His interest in music started at a very young age. At the age of 17, he discovered electronic dance music and was inspired by artists such as deadmau5 and Daft Punk. Over the next few years, he taught himself the art of DJing and saved up his earnings and bought a proper DJ setup, transforming himself from a bedroom DJ into an artist with an unrivaled drive for music production.In late 2011, his first official remix of Gareth Emery's single "Tokyo" was released on Garuda and climbed into Beatport's Top 100 chart. This remix was followed by two other remixes for Steve Aoki and Kaskade, "Ladi Dadi" and "Room for Happiness", respectively. In March 2012, his debut track, "Elva", was released on Ultra Records. Two months later, he remixed Nervo's "You're Gonna Love Again" on EMI, his last release under the alias Pixel Cheese.
Securing over twenty tour dates in his debut year to complement his original releases and remixes, Tom Swoon ended the year warming up for Avicii on his concert tour and on a tour of India with Steve Aoki. Nominated by Nervo as their 'Breakthrough Artist DJ for 2012', and voted as the "Polish Breakthrough DJ of the Year" by FTB Poland, both Mixmag and Billboard Magazine called Swoon an 'Artist to Watch' in 2013.With his remix of Bloody Beetroots - "Chronicles of a Fallen Love", he received further acclaim. His collaboration with Amba Shepherd, "Not Too Late", was followed by a remix package by Bassnectar and Patrick Reza, Maor Levi, Sebjak and Josef Belani. "Not Too Late" also premiered Tom Swoon's first official music video, which was shot and produced in Tokyo. Swoon was called in for another set of remixes for Nervo, Sultan & Ned Shepard's single "Army" and Benny Benassi's collaboration with John Legend called "Dance The Pain Away". In between such duties, Tom's fourth single, "Wings", was released in July and received support from a variety of dance musicians, with the remix by Myon & Shane 54 topping the Beatport trance chart at the No. 1 position for several weeks.
In the third quarter of 2013, Tom Swoon released another collaboration titled "Rollercoaster", together with Josef Belani. On 29 October 2013, he released his remix of Burn It Down by American rock band Linkin Park, which was included in their album Recharged. In December 2013, Tom Swoon launched his own weekly radio show and podcast titled "LIFT OFF Radio", which was broadcast through iTunes and Soundcloud.
In late 2013, he released "Synchronize", a collaboration with Paris Blohm and Hadouken!, which reached the No. 12 position on Beatport progressive charts and hovered for over a month on the top No. 20. 2014 saw the release of his collaboration "Wait" with Paris & Simo, which was released on Spinnin Records. Later that year, DJ Mag also revealed that he had placed 130th in voting for their annual Top 100 DJs poll.


=== Fatal crash and suspension of career ===
In the early morning of 5 December 2017 in his neighbourhood in Poland, he was driving his car under influence of alcohol and caused an accident killing one person and seriously harming another. The prosecutor's office accused him of causing an accident with fatal consequences while driving under the influence of alcohol.
Tom Swoon announced in a public statement on 6 June 2018, that he will be ending his career in music. On 4 September 2018, he was sentenced to four years and eight months in prison, after pleading guilty in court for manslaughter. Swoon also had to pay 280,000 zlotys to the wife and children of the victim, and had his driving license permanently removed. He cited not being able to recall the events prior to the accident, and apologised to the victim's wife for his deeds.
