A group of friends had a band, and were about to go on the road. They asked Cherney if he would drive the truck and roadie for them. One day while on the road, the soundman did not show up to a gig and Cherney ended up mixing the band. The gig went well, and he realized he had an affinity for mixing audio. Later that summer, the band invited him into the studio for his first time.
