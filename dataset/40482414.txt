== Career ==


=== Swartz & Schulner ===
In 2008, Jowie Schulner began his career as part of a Dutch Tech Trance duo, Swartz & Schulner, by winning two remix contests for Hybrid Players and Brent Sadowick. Anthony Nardone's Looks Good (Swartz & Schulner Remix) that was played by UK's trance Legend Judge Jules on BBC Radio 1 as "Tried and Tested" track of the week (The "Looks Good" Remix by Swartz & Schulner has been played by Judge Jules at the Ministry Of Sound nightclub based in London) and Will Atkinson's Pacific Moment (Swartz & Schulner Remix) reached the Top 10 Trance / Tech Trance Charts at Trackitdown, Beatport and Junodownload. Since then, every release of Swartz & Schulner ended up in the top 10 downloads. The duo received several mentions, such as MixMag. They have produced music for Musical Madness (Marcel Woods' record label), CGI records, Virus Audio, Riot Recordings, Crossing Over Recordings, Benefactor, Trance Allstars, Keep On Techno records, Digitally Infected, Tech Art records.  They have also made remixes for Dart Rayne, Iris Deejay, Jason Grey, Joe-E, Louk and Matias Moor as well as produced a radio show called "Wicked Waves" at Digitally Imported.
