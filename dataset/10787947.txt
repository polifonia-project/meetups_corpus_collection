== The Search for the Next Doll ==
Treasure appeared in the first season of the CW reality show Pussycat Dolls Present: The Search for the Next Doll. Sisely was often praised by Robin Antin for her uniqueness and individuality.  On the show, she was a couple years older than the others and said she at times felt like an outsider. She was the third girl eliminated after being told her vocals were off and she didn't live up to her rock persona.  She shook up the show's fanbase and fellow contestant and eventual winner Asia Nitollano when she responded to the contestants' discussion of each other's dancing abilities by stating that she thought that Asia danced "like a drag queen", shortly before she was eliminated, causing the other contestants (with the exception of Nitollano) to burst out laughing. She then very briefly joined the Paradiso Girls.
