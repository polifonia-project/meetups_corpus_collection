F.M. Cornog is an American songwriter, singer, self-taught musician, and home-recordist who records under the name East River Pipe. The New York Times describes Cornog as "the Brian Wilson of home recording."Cornog was born in Norfolk, Virginia, and raised in Summit, New Jersey.  After high school, Cornog worked a series of menial jobs before succumbing to alcoholism,
drug abuse, mental illness, and eventual homelessness, ending up in the Hoboken train station.During this time he met Astoria, Queens-resident Barbara Powers, and with Powers' support and label (Hell Gate), Cornog released some home-recorded cassettes and 7" singles under the name East River Pipe, which he chose after observing a sewage pipe spewing out raw waste into the East River. These initial 7" singles attracted the attention of UK-based Sarah Records who released his records from 1993 to 1996, making Cornog one of the few American artists ever signed to the label.
In the U.S., Cornog released his first LP, Shining Hours In A Can, on the Chicago-based micro-indie Ajax Records in 1994. A year later, he found a more permanent home on Merge Records, the Chapel Hill-based indie run by Mac McCaughan and Laura Ballance. Merge released Poor Fricky (1995), Mel (1996), The Gasoline Age (1999), Shining Hours In A Can (2002;reissue), Garbageheads On Endless Stun (2003), What Are You On? (2006), and We Live In Rented Rooms (2011).
Artists who have covered East River Pipe songs include David Byrne, Lambchop, The Mountain Goats, Okkervil River, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Hazeldine, For Against, Mary Lou Lord, and others. Rolling Stone called Cornog "the most gifted of the new loners."
