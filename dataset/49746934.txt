== History ==
From 2010 to early 2014, Sarah P. was the frontwoman of the Athenian dream pop duo Keep Shelly In Athens. After she left the band, she relocated to Berlin to start working on her solo debut. In December 2015, her solo debut EP Free was released via her own record label EraseRestart.

In early 2016, Psalti released a music video for "I'd Go".
Sarah P.'s solo debut full-length album Who Am I was released in May 2017 and is described as an "ode to our humanly deep need of security and love." The album's first single release, "Berlin During Winter", deals with conflict, both internal and external, tackling depression and how that can be affected by the outside world, from social media to war. The video of "Berlin During Winter" is made of archive footage of war, with Sarah P. noting "we can't undo our history, but we can learn from it and shape our future."
In December 2018, Sarah P.'s second EP Maenads was released. Her second full-length album Plotting Revolutions was released in June 2020.
