== Personal life ==
"Fonseca is also very concerned with changing the rest of the world’s view of his mother country, Colombia, using his music as a platform to publicize the positive aspects of the nation" During his U.S. tour in early 2013, Fonseca made a point to show videos of and to speak personally about Colombia.  On the same tour Fonseca worked with Marca Colombia, ("Brand Colombia" in English) a program run by the Colombian government to re-educate other countries about Colombian culture, as well as with the Colombian airline Avianca, a sponsor of the tour. Of his work with these two entities, Fonseca has said to Colombia Reports, "I am excited that on my Illusion World Tour I will carry the message of Colombia from the Brand Colombia [markets a positive image of the country] to the United States. I am very proud of my country and I'm honored to be its ambassador". Fonseca states that he views music as a representation of culture, so using his music to promote and educate people on Colombia makes sense to him.
