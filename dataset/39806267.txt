Jared MacEachern (born August 16, 1980) is an American Heavy metal musician, best known as a singer and rhythm guitarist of the American heavy metal band Sanctity. In 2013, he joined Machine Head as bassist, replacing Adam Duce.


== Biography ==
MacEachern started singing in his parents' church choir when he was five and did that until he was thirteen. He started playing musical instruments when he was ten, starting with the violin but then switching to cello, and then to bass guitar, which he played for several years.
He graduated from Frank W. Cox High School in Virginia Beach. He went to college for music performance for bass. He then met his future Sanctity bandmates and switched to guitar.
MacEachern became exposed to heavy metal music around the age of twelve. A friend had a copy of Metallica's Black album and he played the song "The Unforgiven." Afterwards, another friend gave MacEachern an old copy of Kill 'Em All. MacEachern was captivated, as he did not previously know music in that style existed. He considers his two favorite heavy metal albums to be Kill 'Em All and Arise by Sepultura. He became completely enamored with all the metal bands of that time, such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Pantera, but for his bass playing, his main influence was former Metallica bassist Cliff Burton.
