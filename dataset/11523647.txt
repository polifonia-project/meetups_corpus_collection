== Career ==
Rocky Burnette was born in Memphis, Tennessee, United States, and became part of the early 1980s revival of the rockabilly style.  He released his first album, The Son of Rock and Roll, on EMI America in 1979.  In the summer of 1980, his single "Tired of Toein' the Line" became a No. 8 pop hit in the United States. The song was also popular internationally, becoming a No. 1 hit in Australia and peaking at No. 3 in South Africa. It reached No. 58 in the UK Singles Chart.EMI America's financial problems interfered with promotion efforts for the follow-up singles (several of which became hits in other countries), and Burnette's second album, Heart Stopper, was not successful.In 1981, Burnette toured Europe with the final version of his deceased father's Rock and Roll Trio.  He also used the band on his next album, Get Hot or Go Home! on Enigma Records.  It also sold poorly, and Enigma dropped Burnette and the Trio rather than release a follow-up.Burnette worked with Rosie Flores and Dwight Twilley in the mid-1990s, and also contributed vocals and the original "Trouble Is I'm in Love With You" to Paul Burlison's 1997 Train Kept A-Rollin'.  In 1996, Burnette released Tear It Up on Core Records.
Burnette co-wrote the European hit "You Got Away With Love" for Percy Sledge in 1997 which was produced by Saul Davis & Barry Goldberg.  He continues to tour internationally at a number of rockabilly shows.
He will appear on BMG's "Americana Railroad" album to be released in 2021.
