Uhm Jung-hwa (Korean: 엄정화; born August 17, 1969) is a South Korean singer, actress and dancer. Uhm is considered to be one of the most influential women in the Korean entertainment industry, with many female artists recognizing her as a role model.Uhm began her career in 1989 as a chorus member for the broadcasting company MBC. She starred in the 1993 romance drama film, On a Windy Day, We Must Go to Apgujeong, and released her debut studio album, Sorrowful Secret, that same year. Though both releases found limited audiences, the album's lead single, "Pupil", helped to establish a uniquely sensual image for Uhm. 
She pivoted to dance music with 1996's "Sad Expectation", and found breakthrough success with "Rose of Betrayal" (배반의 장미) from her third studio album, After Love (1997). Subsequent releases Invitation (1998) and 005.1999.06 (1999) were bolstered by a string of hit singles: "Poison", "Invitation", "I Don't Know" (몰라), and "Festival", which gained status as her signature songs and cemented her position as the preeminent pop icon of the '90s decade. 
Starting in 2001, Uhm began to concentrate efforts on her acting career. Her performance in the 2002 erotic comedy Marriage Is a Crazy Thing won Best Actress at the 39th Baeksang Arts Awards. Her 2000s musical output saw declining commercial reception but greater appeal with critics. Uhm began experimenting with electronica on Self Control (2004), and funk on Prestige (2006), the latter of which won Best Dance and Electronic Album at the 4th Korean Music Awards. Following a nearly decade-long hiatus from music, she released her tenth studio album The Cloud Dream of the Nine in 2017.
