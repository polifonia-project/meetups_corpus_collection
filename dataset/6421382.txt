Sumrall grew up in a Christian home. He says: "My dad was one of the pastors at Applegate Christian Fellowship and my whole family was very involved with the church on a daily basis. It grew to be a very large church of nearly 7,000 people and I found myself even at a very young age in a bit of the spotlight. By the time I was 12 years old, I was involved in leading worship as well as helping with some of the younger Sunday-school groups. I feel like being on stage has been a part of my entire life but little did I know then how these experiences would play into my life."
