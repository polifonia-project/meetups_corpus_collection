== Musical career ==
June Panic first began performing and recording in 1990, and released his early material on cassette tape on his own label 3 Out of 4 Records. He was the first artist ever signed to Bloomington, Indiana-based record label Secretly Canadian, after cofounder Chris Swanson returned to his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, and heard Panic playing at a strip mall. His 1995 album Glory Hole was reissued by Secretly Canadian in 1996, as their first release. The album was 28 songs in length, and drew inspiration from the 28 categories of ancient Tibetan yogic practices.In 2002, Panic went on tour with the Impossible Shapes and Songs: Ohia, and later toured Europe with the Impossible Shapes and Jens Lekman. He is a mainstay of the Fargo music scene, regularly performing with artists from outside of the city, including Bon Iver, Low and Haley Bonar, and David Bazan. Panic was a performer at the 2008 Tanned Tin Festival in Castell√≥n, Spain.June Panic has appeared on several compilation albums, including the 2007 Secretly Canadian compilation SC100, featuring 18 artists signed to the label covering songs by one another. Panic contributed a cover of "Fruitful Weekend" by Danielson Famile, while Nikki Sudden covered Panic's song "Seeing Double".In 2007, Secretly Canadian released a triple album called Songs From Purgatory containing 48 songs he had originally recorded on a four track and released on cassette between 1991 and 1996. The master tapes, located in Panic's parents' basement in Grand Forks, were damaged in the 1997 Red River flood. Panic was successfully able to salvage material from these tapes, which appeared on Songs From Purgatory, featuring mastering by Kramer.
