== Life and career ==
Dobkins was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Helen and Carl Dobkins. He was from a musical family, and learned the ukulele and guitar as a child. He started writing songs in his teens, and began singing at local events.  The Seniors, Dobkins' backup group, included Keith Ross, Paul Powers, Harry Clifton and Bill Smith. The Seniors first met with a common interest in singing at Nast Memorial Methodist Church in Cincinnati. The group sang together for approximately eight years. Dobkins and the Seniors were promoted by Gil Sheppard, a local Cincinnati radio disc jockey, who noted the young singer's early high school compositions and a two-song demo record. This led to a recording contract with Fraternity Records, who released their first record.
After recording "If You Don't Want My Lovin'" at King Records studios, Sheppard sold the master recording to Decca Records. Dobkins then recorded sessions for Decca in Nashville, Tennessee, which included "My Heart is an Open Book" in 1959, which reached No. 3 on the pop chart and number 11 on the R&B chart. He also served in the United States Army Reserve for six months.   When reissued,  "If You Don't Want My Lovin'" reached number 67 later the same year.  Dobkins had two other Hot 100 entries: "Lucky Devil" (number 25, 1959), and "Exclusively Yours" (number 62, 1960).Dobkins was featured frequently at Castle Farms, and on television for the Bob Braun Show (WLW-T, Cincinnati). He appeared fourteen times as a guest on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, and toured with such singers as Bobby Vee, Frankie Avalon, and Jan & Dean. He continued to perform at oldies festivals for some years.
He was inducted into the Cincinnati Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.

Dobkins attended Hughes High School in the late 1950s, but moved to Mt Healthy High School graduating in 1959. Dobkins married Janice Cox in 1960 and had two daughters, six grandchildren, and four great-grand children.
