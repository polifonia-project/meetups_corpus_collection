== Education ==
McFall grew up in the Belvedere neighborhood of East Los Angeles, California, long established as a Mexican-American enclave.  In the 1940 and 1942 Los Angeles Voter Registration directory, Ruben's father, Ernest VanSant McFall (1887–1957), was listed a musician.
McFall attended Westlake College of Music in Hollywood, California, one of the first institutions in the county to offer a diploma in jazz.  The school was founded in 1945 and ran until 1961.  In Los Angeles, during the early 1950s, his friends included trumpeter Donald Roy Fromknecht, Jr. (1928–2012).
