Alexandra Prince (born 1975) is a German singer and songwriter. 


== Biography ==
Prince was born in Hamburg, West Germany to a German father and Brazilian mother.
Her early career started in Germany with the Booya Family, for which she sang many top hits and also Nana's Number 1 Hit "Lonely". Her first solo single "How we livin" was a top 30 hit and stayed in the German Charts for a full 16 weeks.
Since the song "So many Times" by Gadjo feat. Alexandra Prince became a massive international club hit in 2005, Alexandra earned a place as an established, well-respected house diva. The song which she not only sung but also wrote, reached Number 1 in the Worldwide Dance Charts, and number 22 in the official UK Single Charts.
Currently, Alexandra is working together with major house music producers from around the world in the making of her debut album. She has so far being recording with producers such as Steve Angello, Sebastian Ingrosso, Syke'n'Sugarstarr and Till West & DJ Delicious. On top of this she has written songs for Oliver Moldan, DJ Moguai and the label Deep Dish.
According to the Eurodance Encyclopaedia she is rumored to have been the ghost singer of Sqeezer, with frontwoman Lori Stern miming onstage and in video clips to Prince's vocals. It is debated that she may also have been the true singing voice behind Fernanda Brandão from Hot Banditoz and the '90s German teen pop star Blümchen, with Prince providing the higher vocals, while Jasmin Wagner took the spoken/shouted parts.
