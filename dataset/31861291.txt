Ayke Agus (born 1949) is an Indonesian classical violinist and pianist, known primarily through her longtime collaboration with the violinist Jascha Heifetz.  She is one of the rare classical music performers who has performed as a soloist accompanied by an orchestra as a Multi-instrumentalist.


== Early life ==
A native of Indonesia, of Chinese, Dutch and Javanese ancestry, Agus was recognized as a child prodigy at the age of 7 on violin and piano. By the age of 11, she had learned everything Mr. Tan, her teacher in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, had to teach her.  He recommended that she continue her studies with Mr. Adidharma in Jakarta, 450 miles away.  The solution to the inherent logistics problem was for her to study with Mr. Adidharma in the summer, giving her the opportunity to study the piano during the rest of the year.Agus was offered many scholarships, starting at the age of 7, but was unable to pursue them initially because her parents thought her too young to live on her own, and later because she was unable to obtain an exit visa.  A missionary, Sister Brigid Conboy, who was following Agus's career was able to arrange for a scholarship at Rosary Hill College near Buffalo, New York, United States.  After her first paid concert in May 1969, Governor  Ali Sadikin granted her the exit visa.After achieving success in local competitions, she became the youngest member of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra.  This was followed by two full scholarship offers: Juilliard School of Music, recommended by violin pedagogue Ivan Galamian and the University of Southern California.  With her acceptance into the Jascha Heifetz Master Class at USC began a lasting association with him that lasted until his death in 1987.

=== Recording artist ===
Agus has recorded three albums, and has collaborated with a number of other artists as an accompanist or chamber group member.  She combined her talents on both violin and piano on the album Ayke Agus Doubles which was created by using a Yamaha Disklavier piano to mechanically record her piano keystrokes for the accompaniment, which was then played back on the special instrument while she recorded the violin solo with it.

Agus has performed as a violin and piano soloist, as a piano accompanist, chamber group member, and orchestra member throughout the United States, Asia, and Europe, including venues such as the House of Composers, St. Petersburg, Russia, and the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.  On at least two occasions (2004 and 2008), she was a soloist on both instruments playing with the California Philharmonic Orchestra in the same concert.Her piano playing has been described as that which "other pianists talk about with awe", and having a "swinging sense of rubato equal to the composer's challenge."Her violin playing has been described as "illuminated with brilliance like that found in the rays of the sun," and "reminded us of Yehudi Menuhin."
