== 2015â€“2019: Early career and music ==
Vian is a South African immigrant who moved to the United States in 2000. His love of songwriting started out of a need to communicate as English was not his native language. He cites U2, Coldplay, and Death Cab for Cutie as early influences. As a young man he moved to Nashville and opened a recording studio on the historic Music Row. Izak brought an international sound to the Nashville music scene which made him stand out. This is exemplified in his collaborations with Grammy winning South African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo on "Brink of Love" and with Italian composer Davide Rossi on "Sangre de Cristo".He combines his music with the illustrations of Hein Zaayman to create multimedia comic stories. His first multimedia release, Northern Anthems (2018), was nominated for numerous awards including two Independent Music Awards. Music streaming platform Spotify also highlighted the release as a unique project from Nashville.


== 2020: Music and COVID aid ==
In March 2020 Vian worked with U.S. Bancorp to release a COVID-19 television advertisement using his song "Things Will Get Better" encouraging people to stay hopeful in hard times.
