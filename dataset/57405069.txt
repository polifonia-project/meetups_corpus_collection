== Personal life ==
McMahon currently lives in Los Angeles. He previously lived in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.In December 2018, comments made by McMahon during an interview with No Fear of Pop in 2014 were recirculated on social media. In the interview, McMahon replied that he did not wish to collaborate with female musicians, stating, "I don't think my energy would work with that. I mean, I love women, and I have plenty of female friends, but I don't think my energy would work with a woman. I don't know, I can't imagine it, actually. It's just not my vibe, and I don't mean that in any kind of disparaging or critical way; I just don't think chemically it'll work." McMahon responded with a post on Amen Dunes' Facebook page, where revealed that he had been sexually abused by two different adult women throughout his adolescence, between the ages of 9 and 18. He said, "When I finally reached an age where I gained enough courage to begin to acknowledge what happened to me, Amen Dunes became a form of my own therapy. It was the one safe space I had to explore the feelings and the trauma from childhood, and to start to try and reclaim my identity and sexuality as a man." He also said, "I realize without giving context, my answer was not phrased well. At that time I did not feel it appropriate, nor was I healed enough, to explain my reason in detail." The recirculation of McMahon's prior comments on social media without context has been labeled as an example of cancel culture.
