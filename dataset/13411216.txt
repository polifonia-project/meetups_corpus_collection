Rich A. Matteson, (born Richmond Albert Matteson, January 12, 1929, Forest Lake, Minnesota – June 24, 1993, Jacksonville, Florida) was an American jazz artist, collegiate music educator, international jazz clinician, big band leader, and jazz composer/arranger.  Euphonium was his primary instrument, although Matteson was proficient on several other low brass instruments, particularly bass trumpet, valve trombone, tuba, and Helicon.  He also was a proficient jazz pianist.  Except for Kiane Zawadi, Matteson was the only significant euphonium soloist in jazz.

Matteson served two years (1950–52) with the U.S. Army bands.  He then studied music at the University of Iowa.  In 1955, he earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Music from the University of Iowa College of Liberal Arts (his principal instruments were tuba and euphonium).  He then taught high school in Durant, Iowa.  In 1957, he moved to Las Vegas. There he performed on bass trumpet, played the tuba in a walking bass style with Bob Scobey (1958), and worked with the Dukes of Dixieland for two years (1959–61). In 1967 he conducted the Brothers Castro Big Band in Mexico City. He joined the faculty of University of North Texas College of Music in 1973. In 1976 he co-founded, with tuba player Harvey Phillips, the Matteson-Phillips Tubajazz Consort, which consisted of three euphoniums, three tubas, and rhythm section.
In 1986, the University of North Florida appointed Matteson the Koger Distinguished Professor of American Music and, upon retirement in 1992, the university named him Distinguished Professor Emeritus.
