== Career ==


=== 2014-2018: Career beginnings, Vine, and demo EPs ===
Puff first began writing songs in fifth grade. The Left at London project originally started as a band, though after the project fell apart Puff kept the previous group's monicker as her stage name, as she was uncomfortable using her legal name. The name Left at London comes from an experience where Puff misread the sign of a local bar called "The Loft at Tandem". She began posting short videos on Vine in 2014. In 2014 and 2015 while still in high school, Puff released three demo EPs, Youth Group Computer, 2 Rowdy 4 Dennys / Give Peace a Break, and Will Write Songs 4 Money, all receiving very limited releases. The EPs were later re-released on Bandcamp on February 5, 2021.


=== 2018-2019: The Purple Heart and Transgender Street Legend Vol. 1 ===
Puff released her first widely released extended play, The Purple Heart on June 18, 2018. That same year Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 1 was released. The later EP featured her breakout single "Revolution Lover" which went on to receive a music video and be featured in an episode of Welcome to Night Vale. In that year, she started gaining online attention thanks to the success of her viral Twitter video titled "How to Make a Frank Ocean Song". In 2019, additional parodies of Tyler, the Creator and Mitski further popularized Left at London, including recognition from both artists.


=== 2019-present: Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 2, T.I.A.P.F.Y.H., and You Are Not Alone Enough ===
In December 2019, Puff released the Dylan Brady-produced "6 Feet", the first single from Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 2. "Blacknwhite (Radio Edit)" was released On January 14, 2020, as the lead single to her second studio album (at the time announced as her first) You Are Not Alone Enough, an album themed around her mental health. On March 17, 2020, Puff released You Wouldn't Download a Car, a mixtape of her own remixes of various popular songs. On July 20, 2020, she released the two song EP Jenny Durkan, Resign in Disgrace. The EP's title refers to Jenny Durkan, then mayor of Seattle, who [Puff] holds responsible for condoning police violence and causing "the citizens of a historically gay neighborhood to be gassed on the first day of Pride Month." The songs on the EP were also inspired by the establishment of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone and the murdersof Charleena Lyles and Summer Taylor. The first track "Do You See Us?" appears on Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 2. On July 24, she released the four-track covers EP This One's For the Milfs, featuring covers of songs by Janelle Monae, Billie Eilish, Ginuwine, and Kanye West. A day later Tales From Transgender Street, an album of Left at London covers by other artists, was released and promoted through a virtual concert of the same name. Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 2 was released on September 25, 2020. She confirmed in an interview that a third volume of the series is forthcoming. On September 29, 2020, Puff announced that she was working on new music part of a new duo called WOW OK. The band released their first track, a remix of "
