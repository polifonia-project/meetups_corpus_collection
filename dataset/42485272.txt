== Chatroom Controversy Involving Jung Joon Young ==
On April 4, 2019, MBC's "Newsdesk" reported that Eddy Kim was one of the members in a group chat where Jung Joon Young shared illicit videos of him having sex with other women without their consent. Mystic Entertainment revealed later that day that Eddy Kim was in fact in the chatroom, but denied that he was involved in the filming or spreading of the footage.On March 6, 2020, all charges against Eddy Kim were dropped by the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office because the singer had only shared a photo he found online (on one occasion), and did not directly film nor distribute the illicit footage of the women. Additionally, the chatroom where he shared the photo was revealed as not the chatroom where Jung Joon Youngshared the illicit footage, but just a group chat for hobbies.
