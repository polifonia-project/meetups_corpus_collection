Guðlaugur Kristinn Óttarsson (born December 11, 1954) is an Icelandic musician.


== Music career ==


=== Early bands ===
Steinblóm (Stone Flowers) (1969) was his first group. It was a trio formed by Guðlaugur (electric and acoustic guitars), Haraldur Johannessen (acoustic guitar) and Gunnar Magnússon (acoustic bass). Steinblóm played punk versions of artists such as Bob Dylan and Donovan, Guðlaugur originals and folk songs. At that time, he was experimenting with homemade electro-acoustic guitars and amplifiers. Steinblóm played gigs in Reykjavík and the suburbs.
Lótus was created while he was at Laugarvatn high school in 1972. In 1974 and 1975 and played all over Iceland in 1974 when the country celebrated its 1,100th anniversary. Lótus was basically a rock band whose members were Guðlaugur, Guðjón Sigurbjörnsson, both on electric guitars, Böðvar Helgi Sigurðsson (electric bass), Guðmann Þorvaldsson (drums) and Sigurður Ingi Pálsson (vocals). Lotus' music was in the jazz-rock style of Dave Brubeck and Guðlaugur originals, including arrangements to Mozart and Beethoven in a rock style. Lótus did not release any record, but they did some two-track recordings believed to be lost.
He joined Sextettinn (Sextet) (1977) when he was at University. He joined Sveinbjörn Baldvinsson (guitarist), Gunnar Hrafnsson (bass), Stefán Stefánsson (saxophone), Guðjón Hilmarsson (drums), and Kristín Jóhannsdóttir (vocals). The music of Sextettinn was original themes performed in several different styles from country-rock and pop-rock to pop-jazz. Sextettinn gigged throughout Iceland and had a presentation at the local TV station. Guðlaugur stayed for a short time, as his studies were taking most of his time. The remaining members of the group continued under a different name: Ljósin í Bænum, (The Lights of the City) and released an album still popular in Iceland.
Guðlaugur then joined a group called Galdrakarlar & Wilma Reading (The Wizards & Wilma Reading) (1977). This band consisted of brass, keyboards, guitars, bass and drums. The band toured Iceland and gave around 30 concerts. Wilma Reading (vocals), was the group leader. She was an Australian singer and actress with roots in Broadway and Hollywood. Their music style was mainly jazz-oriented with influences from George Gershwin, Louis Armstrong, Oscar Hammerstein II to Duke Ellington. The other members of Galdrakarlar & Wilma Reading, besides were: Birgir Einarsson (trumpet), Hlöðver Smári Haraldsson (keyboards), Hreiðar Sigurjónsson (clarinet and saxophone baritone), Pétur Hjálmarsson (electric bass), Sófus Jón Björnsson (drums) and Stefán Stefánsson (saxophone soprano and flute).


=== Þeyr ===
In January 1981, Guðlaugur joined Þorsteinn Magnússon on guitar, Hilmar Örn Agnarsson (electric bass), Magnús Guðmundsson (lead vocals) and Sigtryggur Baldursson, (drums/percussion).By spring 1981 their first single was on the streets. It was "Life Transmission", the band's first work sung in English. By autumn they came up with Iður til Fóta, a four-track EP. Its cassette version featured "Brennu-Njálssaga", the soundtrack to the eponymous film by Friðrik Þór Friðriksson about Njál's saga.In late 1981 Þeyr released an album titled Mjötviður Mær.
In 1982, Þeyr released their last album with the title of As Above.... This work contains English versions of the group's hits. The most notable song of this record was "Killer Boogie" since it is considered as an attempt to achieve an international position. In 1982 the group performed on a concert in Reykjavík that was recorded and went out as a live concert release named Rokk í Reykjavík (Rock in Reykjavík). This concert gathered some of the important Icelandic bands including Purrkur Pillnikk and Tappi Tíkarrass. Þeyr appeared in this compilation with two songs: "Killer Boogie" and "Rúdolf". That year the group released an EP titled The Fourth Reich.
In 1982, Jaz Coleman, the singer of Killing Joke, had moved to Iceland because he feared that the end of the world was looming. He collaborated with several music bands, but above all with Þeyr, and created a group originally called Iceland, but subsequently renamed Niceland. Although this group was formed by Coleman and Þeyr's musicians, it did not include Þorsteinn Magnússon, the other guitarist. After rehearsing, Niceland was ready to record 5 songs in 1983, but two were not finished; the three recorded songs were: "Guess Again", "Catalyst" and "Take What's Mine". They have never been released officially and still remain as unpublished material.In 1983, Þeyr released the last single: "Lunaire".
In 2001, thanks to the support of family and friends, he released a CD to commemorate Þeyr's 20th anniversary. This CD contained newly discovered mixes of Iður til Fóta y Mjötviður Mær, and was named Mjötviður til Fóta.


=== Kukl and the Elgar Sisters ===
Following Þeyr, Guðlaugur and Sigtryggur joined Einar Örn Benediktsson, the vocalist of Purrkur Pillnikk, Einar Arnaldur Melax keyboardist from Medúsa, Björk Guðmundsdóttir, vocalist of Tappi Tíkarrass and bassist Birgir Mogensen from Spilafífl when Ásmundur Jónsson from Gramm (then Iceland's most important record company) wanted to create a band with cutting-edge artists to perform for the last edition of the radio program Áfangar which had been cancelled. After composing and rehearsing for two weeks the group appeared under the name of Kukl ("Sorcery", in Medieval Icelandic).Although Kukl's style was a type of dark gothic rock in the style of Killing Joke and innovative references to the Fall's post-punk, it was later defined by Björk as "existential jazz-punk-hardcore".
While touring Iceland, they performed with the pro-anarchy group Crass and subsequently visited the United Kingdom in a series of gigs with Flux of Pink Indians.
Their first release was the single "Söngull" in 1983, a version of "Dismembered", corresponding to their following release of The Eye, an album released in 1984. With respect to this work, Sounds magazine gave it 5 stars (excellent) for expanding the music imposed by Crass Records. With decaying metals, disrupted rock sounds and vocal inflections of "Assassin" that show the essence of this album. Other songs include "The Spire" that stands out with central phrases overlapped to background lines and the song "Anna", maker of a threatening environment.On September 14, 1984, Kukl performed in Paris, where they recorded a cassette edited by French independent record label V.I.S.A. with the title of KUKL à Paris 14.9.84. Kukl continued with another album titled Holidays in Europe (The Naughty Nought) in 1986. It was released through Crass Records. This work is far more complex and all wind instruments were replaced by keyboards and bells. Songs like "A Mutual Thrill" are a mélange of pop and experimental post-indie music.Þór Eldon Jónsson, the guitarist of Medúsa had been dating Björk when she became pregnant, so Kukl became an exhausting task. Einar Örn was studying in London and when he came back to Iceland in summer 1986 decided that Kukl was over and a new project should be set up in order to deal with the group's expenditures. The Sugarcubes band soon followed, ending Kukl. Guðlaugur and Birgir Mogensen were the only musicians who did not continue on the new project.Guðlaugur and Björk created the Elgar Sisters, which coexisted with Kukl, although it lasted longer. This group released no albums, but did record 11 songs from 1984 to 1986. Guðlaugur (electric and acoustic guitarist) and composed most of the songs. Björk (vocals), composed three songs (two with Guðlaugur). The Elgar Sisters could be seen as their duo project. The other musicians were Birgir Mogensen (electric bass), Einar Melax (keyboards), Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson (HÖH) (keyboards and synthetic drums), Sigtryggur Baldursson (drums/percussion and Þorsteinn Magnússon (electric guitar).A few songs recorded by the Elgar Sisters came to light via Björks's solo career and on Guðlaugur's solo album released in late 2005.


=== Other music projects ===
Hættuleg Hljómsveit ("The Dangerous Orchestra") was a group in which he participated along Magnús Þór Jónsson (Megas), Björk, Birgir Baldursson, and Haraldur Þorsteinsson. This group, which was active from 1990-1991 was established after the release of Hættuleg hljómsveit & glæpakvendið Stella, an album by Megas in 1990. The band did many concerts in southwestern Iceland, in the outskirts of Reykjavík and later in rural areas of Northern Iceland. By this period Björk was no longer a member. Hættuleg Hljómsveit never released a record.MÖK Trio was a group formed by bassist Tómas Magnús Tómasson (mainly known by his work in Stuðmenn), Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson and Guðlaugur. In fact, the name stemmed from the initials corresponding to the middle name of each member. Their first gig was approximately in 1992. MÖK Trio did not play regularly and they never released an album. Their last presentation was in August 2001 at Galdrahátíðin á Ströndum, Reykjavík.INRI was a project of Magnús Jensson. Guðlaugur joined Magnús and played extensively through Iceland in irregular periods from 1993. Some tracks were recorded in 1995.Gvdl was a group created in 2001 with Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson and bassist Georg Bjarnason for the arrival of the American band Fuck. In fact, the sequence Gvdl corresponds to Fuck with each letter switched to the next one in the alphabet.


=== Collaborations ===


==== Psychic TV ====
In 1984 Guðlaugur added guitars on Psychic TV's album Those Who Do Not. This work was produced by Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson and Guðlaugur and used one of his inventions, the P-Orridgemeter. It was a device that could be programmed with any given frequency and was activated to make an identical structure and pattern for other sampled sound. By this means, digital or sound samples were "played" by individuals who were not physically present. For instance, a vocalist could activate a bell sound. This could be recorded as an identical pattern and then the voice was erased.In 1987 these tracks were reissued with a different name, Live in Reykjavik, an album that was released by Temple Records, the record label owned by Genesis P-Orridge.
