John Campbell (born July 7, 1955) is an American jazz pianist.
Campbell was born in Bloomington, Illinois. He studied piano privately as a youth, then attended University High School (Normal) (class of 1973). He briefly attended Illinois State University where he was known nearly as well for his vibes work as for his piano playing. In the 1970s, he moved to Chicago, then to New York City in the 1980s. He has worked with Buddy DeFranco, Terry Gibbs, Stan Getz, Eddie Harris, James Moody, Charles McPherson, Clark Terry, and Mel Torm√©. Campbell has recorded as a soloist on John Campbell at Maybeck (Concord Jazz, 1993) and in various trios, such as After Hours (Contemporary, 1988) with bassist Todd Coolman and drummer Gerry Gibbs, and Workin' Out (Criss Cross Jazz, 2001) with bassist Jay Anderson and drummer Billy Drummond.
