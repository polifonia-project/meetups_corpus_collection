Vinny Miller (born 1969 in Dorset, England) is an English singer-songwriter and record producer, once signed to the 4AD label.
He first came to musical prominence in 1998 as a 4AD signing under the moniker Starry Smooth Hound, releasing a track co-produced by Guy Fixsen (of Too Pure band Laika) on the label sampler Anakin.Two singles, "Pigpen" and "Breaking Out of Your Arms," preceded Miller's debut studio album  On The Block in April 2004. Two tracks included drumming contributions from Clive Deamer, whose previous credits included recordings with Portishead and Roni Size. Miller states "Pigpen" was first demoed using the opening drum riff from the Led Zeppelin classic recording of blues original When The Levee Breaks.
He has provided guest vocals on tracks by Mark Van Hoen and Sing Sing, toured the US briefly with John Darnielle and Peter Hughes from American act The Mountain Goats, and recorded radio sessions with Mary Anne Hobbs for the BBC Radio 1 show Breezeblock, Gideon Coe for BBC 6Music, John Kennedy for XFM, and for British Council's The Selector. He has also collaborated with Steve Cobby, one-half of electronica acts Fila Brazillia and The Cutler.
Of his prolonged silences Miller says: "I create when conditions are favourable. That could be soon, or it might be never."
