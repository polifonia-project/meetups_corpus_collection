Mojmir Sepe (11 July 1930 – 24 December 2020) was a Slovenian composer, conductor, arranger and trumpeter.


== Career ==
In 1949 he graduated at Celje First Grammar School (gymnasium) in Celje. Later he studied piano and trumpet at Ljubljana Academy of Music.
In 1950 he started his professional music career as a promising trumpet player at Radio Ljubljana Dance Orchestra, but suddenly had to stop due to a night street fight incident at Opatija Festival '65, defending Slovenian singer Elda Viler against pears robbery and his wife next to him, when four guys knocked out a couple of his front teeth. He committed to composing and conducting, mostly influenced by jazz and swing music.
He collaborated with several Slovenian poets who wrote lyrics for his arrangements. Among them were Frane Milčinski Ježek, Gregor Strniša, Branko Šomen, Miroslav Košuta, and Ivan Minatti.

== Brez besed vs. Eres tú plagiarism ==
Eres tú, the Spanish entry in the 1973 Eurovision Song Contest, has been accused of being a plagiarism of the Slovenian song "Brez besed" performed by Berta Ambrož and representing Yugoslavia at the 1966 Eurovision Song Contest. Brez Besed was written by composer Mojmir Sepe and lyricist Elza Budau, both Slovenians. However, Sepe and Budau never officially complained or filed a lawsuit against Eres Tú composer Juan Carlos Calderón, and therefore nothing further happened.


== Eurovision ==
Sepe represented Yugoslavia two times as composer.
Sepe conducted both his compositions in the Eurovision Song Contest. Additionally, he was the conductor for the Slovenian entries in 1997 and 1998. He was also the Slovenian jury member in the 1993 Eurovision pre-selection.


== Personal life ==
Sepe was married to Majda Sepe, a famous Slovenian singer, for whom he also wrote music. He died on Christmas Eve 2020, at the age of 90.
