Paul Robert Ash (February 11, 1891, Germany â€” July 13, 1958, Manhattan, New York) was a German orchestra leader, composer, vaudeville personality, and recording artist, who emigrated to the United States.
He recorded several hit songs: "Rememb'ring" (Brunswick, 1924), with his Granada Orchestra, "My Pet" (Columbia, 1928) and "Shadows on the Swanee" (Columbia, 1933). He also penned Kay Kyser's theme "Thinking of You."
In 1928 he performed a three week engagement in New York City at the Paramount Theatre with a young Ginger Rogers as her career was beginning.
He was born in Germany but, at the age of one, moved to America.
