Steve Roche and David Donaldson and Janet Roddick have been part of the eclectic Wellington music scene for over twenty-five years. They first collaborated as members of the electric 1980s band Six Volts and continued with the Brainchilds. Roche and Donaldson are involved in a band called The Labcoats with David Long, Anthony Donaldson, Riki Gooch and Toby Laing. They also comprise a band called "Thrashing Marlin". The band made a big splash in 1996 with their debut, and was followed by a second release, Garage Sailors in 1999. In 2006, they produced their third album, Witâ€™s end which is a collection of lo-fi, experimental pop music which ranges from a take on a Len Lye vocal sample All You've Got Someday to a Janet Roddick composition Sea of Tranquility. "The finished project is always an envelope-pushing but accessible blend of pop songwriting instincts within the sprawl of free-improvisational jazz and collage-rock. Early Split Enz and The Mutton Birds spring to mind as obvious touchstones".
