In 2012, he released the solo album, G Is for Deep, on Anticon.Doseone is also a visual artist. He has worked on the cover art for many of the albums he has performed on. He has contributed the artwork on Jel's album Soft Money in 2006. He has also done work in animation. He worked on an online animated cartoon NOTGarfield. The series consists of characters from Garfield involved in surreal dada situations.In January 2012 it was announced that Adult Swim has ordered a pilot of an animated series called Mars Safari that will feature a soundtrack by Doseone and Jel. Doseone will star alongside Steve Little and Carl Weathers to voice the character Emilio.Doseone has also participated in creating music for indie games, including Sludge Life, Samurai Gunn, Catacomb Kids, Enter the Gungeon, Vlambeer's games Gun Godz and Nuclear Throne, Messhof's Nidhogg 2, Disc Room and many other independent games currently in development.


== Style ==
Doseone is known for his nasal and high pitched voice, fast polyrhythmic rapping style, and extremely dense and abstract lyrics. His words tend to express upon topics of childhood, nature, and American life. While rapping/singing onstage, he often also simultaneously performs on the synthesizer, sampler, or keyboard.A recurring character in much of Doseone's work is a man named Hour Hero Yes. He is mentioned in the 13 & God song "Ghostwork" as well as throughout albums of his band Subtle. Album and video artwork, as well as art on Subtle's official website, suggest Hour Hero Yes to be a bald man with a black and white striped face; an image which is embodied by a bust that serves as a centerpiece prop during live Subtle shows. On the cover of For Hero: For Fool, he appears in old military garb with fire for hair.
