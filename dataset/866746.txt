Shep Pettibone (born 10 July 1959) is an American record producer, remixer, songwriter and club DJ, one of the most prolific of the 1980s.


== Career ==
Shep Pettibone surfaced after his work with Arthur Baker on Afrika Bambaataa & The Jazzy 5's "Jazzy Sensation" and as an in-house mix engineer for Prelude Records. 
During his recording career, he launched innovative "mastermixes" for New York's KISS FM. The popularity of these mixes persuaded Prelude Records to release some of them commercially. 
Pettibone built his brand through his personal approach to remixing tracks, specially crafted for the dancefloor. Acclaimed by DJs worldwide, he was the go-to man to achieve club and chart success. His prowess at production and mixing led him to work with such artists as Madonna and George Michael the late 1980s during the height of these artists' popularity. His influence is still perceivable in today's music.
Pettibone is the subject of the first volume of the Arthur Baker Presents Dance Masters series, Shep Pettibone: The Classic 12″ Master-Mixes, a 47-song box set with highlights from his career.
