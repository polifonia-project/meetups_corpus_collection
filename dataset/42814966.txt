Matt and Bubba Kadane is an American musical duo that consists of two brothers, Matt Kadane and Bubba Kadane. They have founded three indie rock bands, serving as producers, songwriters, vocalists, and guitarists in all of them. The first, Bedhead, released three well-received studio LPs before it was disbanded. The brothers reformed as The New Year in 2001, and in 2012 they formed the group Overseas with David Bazan and Will Johnson.
