Having heard Coates singing on an Edwin Hawkins Singers gospel album, he decided to use her on the recording as it needed a female voice. Anka was pleased with the results (both artistically and commercially; the song reached number one) and recorded several more songs with her. The two recorded several more  Top 10 & Top 20 hits, including 1974's "One Man Woman/One Woman Man" and 1975's "I Don't Like to Sleep Alone" and "(I Believe) There's Nothing Stronger Than Our Love".

Both songs come from her only self-titled solo album released in 1975 by United Artists Records with producer Rick Hall. Also recorded "Make It Up To Me Baby" on the Buddah label in 1973, written by Anka and Harris and very much sought after by soul collectors.
