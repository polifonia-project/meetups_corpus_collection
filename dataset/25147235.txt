== History ==

Spaceman Patterson was one of the musicians in Miles Davis' touring line-up in the 1980s. In 1992, Patterson provided music for Ntozake Shange's The Love Space Demands, an adaptation of some of her poetry. In 1995, Patterson produced Melvin Van Peebles' 1995 album Ghetto Gothic. In 2003, he was musical director for the play Dream on Monkey Mountain presented at the Harlem School of the Arts.In 2008, Patterson was enlisted to produce a hip hop album for Bill Cosby. Known at that time for his comedic work and not for performing hip hop, Cosby's album came as a surprise to some. Patterson told the Associated Press that when Cosby contacted him about making the album, "people started speculating, is he going to rap about Jell-O Pudding Pops or what?" The resulting release, titled The Cosnarati: State Of Emergency, came out on November 14, 2009 on World Alert Music.
In 2016, Spaceman Patterson played guitar on multiple Frank Ocean recordings, including the albums Endless and Blonde. As of 2018, at least 20 hours of outtakes from Patterson's Frank Ocean sessions have not been released.
