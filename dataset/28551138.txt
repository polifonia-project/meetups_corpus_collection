Nick Egan (born 4 July 1957 in London, England) is a visual design artist, and director of music videos, commercials and film.  He graduated from the Watford College of Art and Design with a DGA in 1976. While attending college, he created cover art for the singles "White Man In Hammersmith Palais" and "Tommy Gun" for The Clash and T-shirt design for the single "Sheena is A Punk Rocker" for The Ramones. His first chart topping album cover was Dexys Midnight Runners' 'Searching For The Young Soul Rebels'. He collaborated with former Sex Pistols manager and fashion entrepreneur Mr. Malcolm McLaren, for whom he designed the album cover for Bow Wow Wow's 'See Jungle'. His longtime partnership with McLaren McLaren led the art direction of McLaren's own inventive albums; Duck Rock and 'Fans'. Egan relocated from Britain to New York, where he created cover art for legendary artists like Bob Dylan and Iggy Pop. Egan also art directed books; John Lennon Listen To These Pictures by Rock-n-Roll photographer Bob Gruen and Bob Dylan's Drawn Blank.


== Art direction in fashion ==
In the early 1980s during London's thriving Piccadilly fashion scene, Egan designed much of the graphic material for Vivienne Westwood's 'Worlds End' clothing line and later art-directed her fashion shows in London and Paris. In New York he continued his exploration in fashion by designing the label for the first collection by Marc Jacobs. The name of the collection was 'Sketchbook'. In addition to art directing Jacob's early fashion shows, Egan's collaboration with Jacobs would continue through the designer's meteoric rise in the fashion business. Additionally, the pair later collaborated on a Sonic Youth video "Sugar Kane", which featured actress Chloë Sevigny in one of her first ever appearances in front of the camera. Egan is presently designing T-shirt prints for retailers Superfine Jeans and 2K Creative.


== Video and film director ==
With the advent of MTV, Egan facilitated his artistic shift into film work through the direction of music videos, the first of which was Iggy Pop's "Real Wild Child". After a period of working with INXS on their multi-platinum 'Kick' and 'X' albums, he relocated to Los Angeles where in time he solidified his place as one of Hollywood's premier music video directors earning among other distinctions, a nomination for an MTV Music Video Award (Soup Dragons, 'Divine Thing'). He went on to direct close to one hundred music videos for many of the top names in the music industry including INXS, Oasis, Duran Duran, Sonic Youth, Kylie Minogue, Belinda Carlisle and Mick Jagger. A May 1997 article in Promo Magazine referred to him as 'his MTVness'. Egan moved into the commercial arena, directing TV spots for such brands as Coca-Cola, Levi's, Nike, Nintendo and Sony PlayStation. Nick's first feature-length film was 'Red Light Runners' starring; Michael Madsen, Harvey Keitel, Roy Schneider, and Crispin Glover. Filming was halted mid production.

College reference book 'Designing For Music' (published by Spencer Drate, 1992) refers specifically to the work of Nick Egan.
