In 1977 he released the album "Acariciame" (Caress Me) and one year later, he was selected by TCS to represent his country in the seventh edition of the OTI Festival that was held in Santiago, Chile. Although he got the second to last place, tied with the colombian entrant Billy Pontoni, this was not an obstacle for his career. He became better known in the 1980s. Years later, Torres moved to the United States. He lived in Colorado, California and finally Florida. In 1991 Torres had an artistic breakthrough when he released "Nada Se Compara Contigo". He was voted Songwriter of the Year by BMI in 1994.
