Pavle Merkù (pronounced [ˈpaːu̯lɛ mɛɾˈku]) (12 July 1927 – 20 October 2014) was an Italian-Slovene composer, ethnomusicologist, Slovene specialist, and etymologist.


== Life ==
Merkù was born in Trieste on 12 July 1927. He received a bachelor's degree in Slavic studies at the University of Ljubljana in 1950, and he obtained his doctorate in Rome in 1960. He studied composition in Trieste. As a composer, he primarily wrote chamber music and works for choral ensembles. He wrote the opera Kačji pastir (The Dragonfly). His professional work involved both music and Slovene studies. In the mid-1960s he started collecting folk songs among ethnic Slovenes living in Italy; this eventually grew into a collection of stories, customs, superstitions, and other folk material that he published in 1976 under the title Ljudsko izročilo Slovencev v Italiji (Slovene Folk Heritage in Italy). In 2004 he published the book 1300 primorskih priimkov (1,300 Littoral Surnames), which complemented the etymological research of France Bezlaj. Merkù was a member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He died in Trieste at the age of 87.

Some of Merkù's books are seminal works, and his creativity and confident approach mark the Slovene physical and cultural presence in Trieste."Merkù received the Prešeren Award for lifetime achievement in 2014.
