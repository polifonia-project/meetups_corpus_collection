Don Mancuso (born March 26, 1955 in Rochester, New York) is an American rock music guitarist and songwriter best known for his role as guitarist and co-writer for the rock band Black Sheep as well as The Lou Gramm Band and The Voice of Foreigner.  He also has a successful solo career and continues to work with Phil Naro in DDrive. He is also working with Regi Hendrix on his first solo effort.


== Biography ==
Mancuso attended Greece Olympia High School in Rochester, New York, and graduated in 1973. He attended the College Of Marin for music and graduated from Monroe Community College with an AAS degree in Electronics Engineering in 1988.


=== Pre-solo work ===
Mancuso began his music career playing guitar in Black Sheep. After the release of the band's self-titled Black Sheep and Encouraging Words, he continued to write and record with groups such as Cheater, Lou Gramm Band, Johnny Smoke, The Park Ave Band, Phil Naro and Celtic Fire.


=== The Lou Gramm Band ===
In 2004, Mancuso was asked to join his former Black Sheep bandmate (and former Foreigner frontman) Lou Gramm in his new Lou Gramm Band, which also included another Black Sheep alumnus, Bruce Turgon.  The band plays old Foreigner hits as well as Lou Gramm Band material, and released a Christian rock release, for which Mancuso wrote half the music.
