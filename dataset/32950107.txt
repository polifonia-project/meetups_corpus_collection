Eric Matthew, real name Joseph "Joe" William Tucci (born 1953), has been a record label owner, record producer, engineer, songwriter and guitarist, previously involved in the New York post-disco scene of the early 1980s.


== Biography ==
Matthew originally performed at weddings, bar mitzvahs and parties in the New York metropolitan area with his friends, then after producing a demo with fellow bandmember Gary E. Turnier, he landed a record deal with indie label SAM Records, owned by Sam Weiss, which by then had major label Columbia as their distribution company.  Essentially a minimal rock combo with musical influences ranging from deep funk, pop, jazz to disco that consisted of a saxophonist, a trombonist, a flutist, a percussionist, and keyboardists, was named Gary's Gang by Matthew. His second album Keep on Dancing  performed well on the music charts, peaking at #27 on the Billboard R&B Albums and #42 on the Billboard 200. This accomplishment led Matthews to open his own record label and produce other artists. Among those he produced were "Reach Up" by Toney Lee (on his own label) or the album Redd Hott by Sharon Redd (for Prelude Records).
Matthew, a pseudonym of Joe Tucci, is married and has three daughters. Musically his influences include 1960s pop and the "zaniness of the later Beatles albums." He produced records like Tracy Weber's "Sure Shot," Sinnamon's "Thanks to You," and Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde's "Genius Rap" in his garage.
