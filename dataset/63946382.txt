Marjory was born in Eyemouth in Berwickshire in 1943, but married Richard Dougal, who lectured at the University of Edinburgh.  They settled in Edinburgh where, during the 1970s and 1980s she was a learning support teacher in Edinburgh primary schools in the town such as Sciennes, Tollcross and South Morningside.  Although not a professional musician, Marjory loved music and played the piano, so she took the opportunity to establish recorder and other music groups in these schools.  Marjory encouraged her daughter Fiona and son Ian to learn to play musical instruments, and they both became involved with the Edinburgh Youth Orchestra.  In 1989, when the EYO concert tour of California was completed, and she learned of a vacancy for an orchestral manager, she successfully applied for the job, and retired from teaching.
