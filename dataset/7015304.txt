Mr Fogg is an English electronic musician from Reading, Berkshire, England.  He is the grandson of an opera singer and the great grandson of two 19th Century music-hall performers.


== Origin of name ==
Mr Fogg derives his name from Phileas Fogg, the main fictional character in the 1872 Jules Verne novel, Around the World in Eighty Days.  In an interview with BBC Radio 1's Annie Nightingale, he stated that the name arose as, 'Phileas sounds somewhat like Phil', his own Christian name.

Mr Fogg's first solo material appeared at the end of 2005, and was followed by a national tour and the self-released debut single, "Giving In" which gained BBC Radio 1, BBC 6Music and XFM airplay.
After winning the 2006 BBC Radio Berkshire demo search contest, Mr Fogg won the opportunity to open the Carling Stage at the Reading and Leeds Festivals over the August 2006 festival weekend, playing with a five piece live band.Towards the end of 2006, Mr Fogg released "Seciov" on Worst Case Scenario Records, receiving substantial airplay on BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, BBC 6Music, XFM, MTV2 and QTV, including records of the week from Marsha Shandur on XFM and Tom Robinson on 6 Music. As well as a tour, live appearances included "Mr Fogg's Latin Lesson" on the Annie Nightingale's BBC Radio 1 show and a live session for Janice Long on BBC Radio 2 - including an interview and live versions of "Stung", "Moving Pictures" and "Seciov".
