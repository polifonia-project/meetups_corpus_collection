== Artistry ==
O'Connor described her music as being influenced by gospel, soul, and house musics, as well as by the electronic music she heard at the German nightclub Berghain. As her parents surrounded her with folk and soul music, she lists Alicia Keys, Leonard Cohen, Lou Reed, Joni Mitchell, Aretha Franklin, Billie Holiday and Marvin Gaye among her major influences. Noisey wrote that O'Connor "blends Bat for Lashes' cosmic mystic pop, Stevie Nicks' breathless vulnerability, and possesses the vocal chops to keep up with Adele", while Hunger magazine wrote that her output "feels spiritual and almost occultist".
