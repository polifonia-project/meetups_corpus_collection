== Background ==
Steinberg was born and raised in Los Angeles by his parents, a teacher and a librarian, who pushed public service along with ambition. He attended Hamilton High School. He attended the University of California Los Angeles, for one year (1966â€“67) before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley. He also was a resident assistant at the UC Berkeley dorms and had Steve Bartkowski and Steve Wozniak on his floor. Steinberg eventually formed his own student government political party, called Unity. His moderate politics at the protest-prone Berkeley at the height of the Vietnam War drew such a following that he was elected President of the Associated Students of the University of California, the university's student government. He subsequently resigned from his post as a result of a cheating scandal. He earned a B.A. in political science in 1970 and a J.D. in 1973 from UC Berkeley.

For many years Steinberg and Jeff Moorad had a sports agency partnership called "Steinberg, Moorad & Dunn", or "SMD". They sold that firm in October 1999 to Assante Sports Management Group, a Canadian financial-management firm, for a reported $120 million. Assante acquired several other sports agencies. In February 2002, David Dunn left SMD to open Athletes First, taking about 50 NFL players with him and opening offices about a mile from Steinberg's in Newport Beach, Calif. Extensive litigation ensued involving Dunn and Assante.Steinberg has successfully negotiated over $3 billion in contracts for players including Troy Aikman, Steve Young, and Ryan Leaf.
