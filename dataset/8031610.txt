Romero Lubambo (born 1955) is a Brazilian jazz guitarist.


== Career ==
He was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He grew up with American jazz and classical music in the house because his uncle played guitar, lived next door, and visited frequently. Lubambo tried classical piano for two years but quit. At thirteen, he picked up the guitar and taught himself how to play because there was no one else around to do it. The following year he joined a band and performed professionally for the first time. From 1972 to 1977, he attended the Villa-Lobos School of Music to study classical guitar. He went to college and got a degree in engineering in 1980, but he pursued music instead.After moving to the U.S. in 1985, he worked with singer Astrud Gilberto. During the next year, he met Herbie Mann, who Lubambo considered "my American father, my mentor for life." He formed Trio da Paz with Duduka da Fonseca and Nilson Matta and has recorded and toured with them. He tours extensively with Dianne Reeves. He has also worked with Claudia Acuña, Leny Andrade, Gato Barbieri, Michael Brecker, Larry Coryell, Regina Carter, Dave Douglas, Paquito D'Rivera, Diana Krall, Ivan Lins, Wynton Marsalis, Pat Metheny, Jason Miles, Jane Monheit, Hermeto Pascoal, Flora Purim and Airto Moreira, Dan Costa (composer), Luciana Souza and Billie Eilish.
Dos Navegantes, a collaboration album by him, Edu Lobo and Mauro Senise, won the 2017 Latin Grammy Award for Best MPB Album.
