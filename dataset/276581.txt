Martin Lee Gore (born 23 July 1961) is an English songwriter, musician, singer, record producer, and DJ. He is one of the founding members of the electronic rock band Depeche Mode and is its primary songwriter. Gore is the band's guitarist and keyboardist, contributes backing vocals, and occasionally provides lead vocals. Gore possesses a tenor singing voice which contrasts with Dave Gahan's dramatic baritone and is also known for his flamboyant and (sometimes) androgynous stage persona. Gore has also released several solo albums and collaborated with former Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke as part of VCMG.Gore's lyrics included themes such as sex, religion, and politics. Gore has said he feels lyrical themes which tackle issues related to solitude and loneliness are a better representation of reality, whereas he finds "happy songs" fake and unrealistic. At the same time, he asserts that the band's music contains "an element of hope".In 1999, he received the Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors for "International Achievement". He was given the Moog Innovation Award "for his many contributions to the exploration of sound in popular music" in 2019, and became a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member in late 2020 with fellow Depeche Mode members Andrew Fletcher and Dave Gahan.


== Early life ==
Martin Lee Gore was born in London, England. His biological father was an African-American G.I. stationed in Britain. Gore was raised by his stepfather David Gore and biological mother Pamela, who both worked at the Ford of Britain motor plant in Dagenham. He believed his stepfather was his biological father until age 13, when he learned of his biological father. As an adult, Gore met his biological father in the American South. Gore has described his upbringing as "normal" and "stable" but said he was also an introvert and preferred to spend time reading alone rather than with school peers. However, he also stated that he enjoyed his time at school and took part in foreign exchange trips.Gore taught himself to play keyboard from the 1970s, never receiving formal tuition. He learned to perform chart hits, figuring out their structures via the magazine Disco 45. Gore left Nicholas Comprehensive, Basildon after completing his A-levels in 1979 and took a job as a bank cashier. During evenings, weekends and any other spare time, he was involved with the local band Norman and the Worms. Gore became interested in electronic music upon hearing acts such as Kraftwerk, the Human League and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD). He borrowed a Korg 700S from a friend, before purchasing a Yamaha CS5, his first synthesizer.Gore has two younger half-sisters, Karen, born in 1967, and Jacqueline, born in 1968.


== Depeche Mode ==

In 1980, Gore met Andy "Fletch" Fletcher at the Van Gogh club. Fletcher recruited Gore into his band Composition of Sound along with Vince Clarke. Soon the band drafted Dave Gahan to be the band's lead singer after hearing him sing "Heroes" by David Bowie. Gore is the band's keyboardist, contributes backing vocals, and occasionally provides lead vocals.When explaining the choice for the band name Depeche Mode (which was taken from French fashion magazine Dépêche mode), Gore said, "It means hurried fashion or fashion dispatch. I like the sound of that." However, the magazine's name (and hence the band's) is "Fashion News" or "Fashion Update".Gore wrote two tracks on Depeche Mode's debut album, Speak & Spell: "Tora! Tora! Tora!" and the instrumental "Big Muff". "Any Second Now (voices)" features Gore's first lead vocals for the band. When Clarke announced his departure from Depeche Mode in 1981, Gore became the principal songwriter for the band. Songs Gore wrote for Depeche Mode's second album, A Broken Frame (1982) differed musically and lyrically from Clarke's. Gore's writing became gradually darker and more political on subsequent Depeche Mode albums. He sings lead vocals on several of the band's songs, notably ballads – his tenor voice provides a contrast to Gahan's dramatic baritone.Gore sometimes plays guitar (typically his Gretsch White Falcon or Gretsch Double Anniversary) on Depeche Mode songs. The first time guitar was used as the main instrument was on "Personal Jesus", although he used small guitar parts on previous songs, such as "Behind the Wheel" and "Love, in Itself". Gore's guitar playing developed even more on Songs of Faith and Devotion. However, in live performances, he switches his keyboards for his guitar on some older Depeche Mode songs, such as "Never Let Me Down Again" and "A Question of Time". In mid-1990, Gore said, "I think in a way we've been at the forefront of new music; sort of chipping away at the standard rock format stations."


== Other work ==
Gore has released the following solo albums: Counterfeit (1989), Counterfeit2 (2003), MG (2015) and The Third Chimpanzee (2021).
