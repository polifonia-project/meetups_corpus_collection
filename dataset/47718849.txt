== Musical style and influences ==
Nishizawa's music style focuses on rock, and she lists artists such as Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters as her musical inspirations. Her love of music was also influenced by her father, who owned a guitar and was the first to teach her how to play music.In interviews with Anican and Animate Times, Nishizawa related the production of "Fubuki", her first single. The single began as a demo recorded shortly after she won her audition. The demo had no title and different lyrics, and at the time of her audition, it had yet to be decided that she was to sing the song for Kantai Collection. She mentioned that she was not familiar with the series before making the single, and that she felt pressured about debuting in a franchise that was very popular. After the release of the single, she was "filled with emotions" and was determined to start writing her own songs, as "Fubuki" was not written by her.The production of Nishizawa's second single "Brand New World" was discussed in an interview with Newtype. She relates how she wanted to challenge herself by writing the lyrics to the title track. She used as influences the relationship of the characters Ayato and Julis from The Asterisk War, particularly their "feelings of emotion". She used lyrics such as "bloom powerfully" to convey a message of "pushing through even when feeling the sense of pain". For the single's B-side "Piacere", she wanted the song to relate to Aria the Avvenire depicting a generational change, and to express the feelings of kindness, pleasure, and sadness.In an interview with Akiba Souken, Nishizawa described the production of her first album Break Your Fate. The album revolved around the theme of "fate", particularly on the feeling of "fighting one's self". She described the feeling of fate being created by the mind as weakness, that a person would then need to fight. For the album's second track "Shark", she wanted to express the impression of sharks as "scary and dangerous" creatures that need to swim to breath. The song features a long English phrase as she wanted to "do expressions that she had never done before". The song "Gemini" is meant to represent a fantasy world, while the song "Feel This Moment" was meant to serve as her anthem for her live performances.Nishizawa related to Animate Times and Akiba Souken the production of her fifth single "Love Men Holic". Since the song was to be used as the ending theme to the anime series Ms. Koizumi Loves Ramen Noodles, she wanted to write a love song that would use ramen-related words as puns in the lyrics. An example is the song's title, with "Love Men" being a take on the word "ramen", while she also used the lyrics "show you" as a pun on shōyu (醤油), the Japanese word for soy sauce. One influence in the song is the personality of the series' main character Koizumi, who Nishizawa describes as not "putting emotions on the table", thus inspiring the use of salt-related terms in the lyrics.
