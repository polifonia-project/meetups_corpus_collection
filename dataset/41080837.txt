Valerie Agnew is best known as the drummer of 7 Year Bitch. Agnew moved from Ohio to Seattle, Washington, where she met the musicians that would become her future bandmates: Selene Vigil (vocals), Elizabeth Davis (bass), and Stefanie Sargent (lead guitar). They formed 7 Year Bitch and signed with C/Z Records. They released their debut album Sick 'Em in 1992.
While still living in Ohio, Agnew dated Steve Moriarty, the drummer for the American punk band the Gits. Additionally, Agnew was a very close friend of Mia Zapata, the band's frontwoman. In 1993, Zapata was brutally raped and murdered while walking home late at night.  In response, Agnew and 7 Year Bitch released the album ¡Viva Zapata!, dedicated to Zapata. The album also featured songs about former guitarist Stefanie Sargent, she died of asphyxiation from vomiting after passing out drunk on June 27, 1992. In 1995, the band signed with Atlantic Records, and a year later released their final studio album, Gato Negro.  With the recent departure of their guitarist, Roisin Dunne, and the geographical separation between bandmates, 7 Year Bitch's career came to a close after a final tour with San Francisco's Lost Goat.
