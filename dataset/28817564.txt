She studied composition privately with Zdeněk Fibich and Vítězslav Novák and began composing at the age of thirteen. Emingerová performed her first solo concert at age nineteen in the Konvikt concert hall.In the 1870s Emingerová began composing dances, especially polkas, which were popular at the Prague balls.
