Metamorpheus is Steve Hackett's 17th studio album. This classical album is the successor to A Midsummer Nights Dream. Metamorpheus is an expression on Orpheus and his passage through the Underworld.
The cover of the album was created by Kim Poor, the picture on the sleeves of the previous album To Watch The Storms also features the song "Rebecca".
This album makes use of themes first used by Hackett in short pieces (only released as free MP3 downloads) for the soundtrack of the 2001 Showtime documentary Outwitting Hitler.
