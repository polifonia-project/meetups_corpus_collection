== Music career ==


=== 2008â€“present ===
After 3 years and a junior at Daniel Murphy High School, the Archdiocese decided to shut the school's doors. Jeremy, who'd been building a name for himself on campus by recording students in his bedroom studio at his grandmother's was forced to relocate senior year. Stating to KHH, " I went to a private school called Daniel Murphy. It got shut down actually. I had to complete my last year of High School at a new High School". After moving out of his grandmother's house, he moved in with his father. Gutting the garage and making a studio space in the spring of 2008. Often recording his cousin Left Brain, who brought Tyler The Creator, Hodgy Beats, Casey Veggies, of the year old collective Odd future. Recording and producing for the collective, The Odd Future Tape, The Dena Tape.JHawk attended The Academy of Music and Performing Arts Alexander Hamilton High School (Los Angeles) in the summer of 2008. Due to a credit issue, he was required to attend a piano lesson class for admission and freshman PE class his senior year. Subsequently, adding an Electronic Music and Music History course, soon meeting friend Syd Tha Kyd in Hamilton's Mr. Bruning electronic music class. After being at Hamilton for months and remaining unnoticed he aggressively fought to gain attention. Garnering his Myspace page he began to send out beats, connecting with YG (rapper) on MySpace, the two collaborated on songs that would combine for over 3 Million plays.


=== Jerkin' ===
With a heavy influence from then Hyphy movement, (Keak da Sneak, Turf Talk, E-40) and newfound fame from working with YG & The Pu$haz Jeremy started to collaborate with anyone, often his fellow students on campus. Slowly building recognition, kids on campus started to dance to the music, in all styles, but most notably a new style called Jerkin'. Taking notice saying, "I never sought out to make a jerk beat. I always just did me. I did JHawk. People danced to my music and I kind of developed a formula to what they were grabbing off of my beats." Eventually dance crews such as the Rangers formed on campus and videos were made with the music to match amassing tens of millions of hits on Myspace and the newly created YouTube. At the age of 17 and having worked with almost all of La's male youth, he longed to form a group. On the bleachers in the PE class he was succumbed to is when he met 6 female freshman who all rapped. The same day they quickly formed the name of the group Pink Dollaz. After 2 months the music was streamed over 5 million times across Myspace and YouTube with radio spins from Dj Carisma's Power 106.   A slew of relationships such as these formed by spring 2009. Another song titled 'Tippin' today amasses 14 million plays on one YouTube video alone. LA Weekly's Jeff Weiss stating, "The wiry J-Hawk is the nexus that binds all of these groups together. After all, he's produced their hits, and to think it might not have happened if Daniel Murphy High hadn't shuttered last year, causing the 17-year-old Hawkins to transfer to Hamilton". The genre, sound and culture exploded mainstream. Accidentally, JHawk was born. After amassing press mentions from The New York Times, LA Times LA Weekly and a host of acts signed to major label deals. New Boyz, The Rej3ctz, Cold Flamez, Audio Push, The Bangz, and YG (rapper). JHawk stated, "I'm definitely fortunate for the movement and being one of the starters of it back in 2008".


=== Cat Daddy ===
After a year and growing frustrated he re-connected with The Rej3ctz sharing similar emotions, "We were major contributors, but we felt we weren't getting our shine. So we wanted to start a new movement." In the spring of 2010 at JHawk's Home recording studio crafted, Cat Daddy.
