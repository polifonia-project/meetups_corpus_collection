== History ==
Lida Husik was born in 1963 in Washington, D.C. Starting in third grade, she learned violin and performed in her grade school band, Lafayette Elementary School orchestra. Eventually she taught herself how to play the drums and joined the punk band the Mourning Glories. During her brief time with the band, Husik learned about 4-track recording and decided to pursue a career as a solo artist. Eventually Don Fleming, frontman of the Velvet Monkeys, introduced her to producer Kramer. Through Shimmy Disc, Kramer's record label, Husik released her debut album Bozo. At this point she had taught herself how to play several instruments including the guitar, bass guitar, and piano. In 1994, she caught the attention of Beaumont Hannant, a British producer and DJ and collaborated with him on projects.
