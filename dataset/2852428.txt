== Life ==
Matt Costa, who is of Portuguese descent, states that his father works in the airline business. In early 2003, Matt's homemade demo reached No Doubt guitarist Tom Dumont, who offered to record more demos for Costa in his home studio. Those first recordings led to two EPs (Matt Costa EP, Elasmosaurus EP) that Costa and Dumont distributed themselves. These were later combined and mixed by Phil Ek to form Costa's first full-length CD entitled Songs We Sing.
Costa spent the summer of 2005 opening on Jack Johnson's summer tour. He has since toured with Modest Mouse, Oasis, Ryan Adams & The Cardinals, G. Love & Special Sauce, and Death Cab for Cutie. Costa joined Jack Johnson for his 2006 European tour. He has also contributed to the Jack Johnson and Friends Curious George soundtrack; his track is entitled "Lullaby". This song was taken from his The Elasmosaurus EP. Costa has also toured extensively in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Asia and South America.
The video for Costa's first single "Cold December" was released February 2, 2006. On July 31, 2007, he released a song titled "If You Took To Me" as part of the environmentally minded polar bear documentary Arctic Tale and its soundtrack.
On October 7, 2007, Matt released the first single, "Mr. Pitiful," from his record Unfamiliar Faces. The song "Mr. Pitiful" was used during a scene with Paul Rudd in the movie I Love You, Man, the redband trailer for the film Youth in Revolt starring Michael Cera, and the movie Marmaduke. The song is featured during the opening credits of The Answer Man. Apple also used an instrumental cut of this song for the worldwide iPhone 3GS ads.
On December 23, 2008, Costa married.
Mobile Chateau, Matt's third album, was released on September 21, 2010, via Brushfire Records. The record was recorded at Pheasant Studios in Santa Ana, California as Costa's first solo production.
In 2012, he released an EP titled Sacred Hills EP.
His fourth album, which he decided to self title, was released in 2013. It contained some songs from his previously released EP such as "Loving You" and "Good Times".
Shortly after the release of the Self-Titled album, along came a Deluxe and commentary version of the album.
His song "Good Times" was featured at the end of an episode of the third season of HBO's Girls in 2014.
In 2015, Costa released a string of self recorded EPs. First of the storm came Eucalyptus EP, with its acoustic style. Mid year brought Cat Mosta EP. The end of the year carried the EP titled Neon Brain EP. Before the year ended, he released a Christmas song titled Many Memories Ago.
Costa began 2016 with another EP called Anchor and The Albatross EP. Later, he released an album for a documentary titled Orange Sunshine. The documentary revolved around The Brotherhood of Eternal Love. The album held a psychedelic rock style. Ending 2016, Matt released a small bunch of songs recorded live when he had gone on a trip to London.
In 2017, the single Where Have All my Heroes Gone was released.
