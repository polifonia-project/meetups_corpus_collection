She represented the UK at the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest in Kyiv with "Touch My Fire". Hylton has also had a string of singles in the UK.

== Early life ==
Hylton was born in London and grew up in Ladbroke Grove.From a young age, she had a passion for dance: "I didn't like singing. I started stage school at 10, because at my normal school, there were always fights. So I thought, what do I want to do? I want to dance."For two years, Hylton played Nala in a production of The Lion King in London's West End. Following the end of the run, she began writing songs and pursuing a career in music.She auditioned for ITV's Popstars: The Rivals, a reality television talent show in which young hopefuls sought to be picked for a place in a new manufactured group.She was one of the last six contenders for a place in the girl group, but she lost out on a spot in what later became the chart-topping group Girls Aloud. She instead embarked on a solo singing career.


== Recording career ==
In the summer of 2003, Hylton released her debut single "Real Things", which featured a sample of M.O.P.'s hit "Ante Up". The single charted in the UK Singles Chart at Number 4, and remains her biggest hit to date. Three further Top 20 hits from her debut album followed, "Surrender (Your Love)" (which sampled the Diana Ross hit "Surrender"), "Best of My Love" and a cover of Jade's "Don't Walk Away", a double A-side with a cover of Carole King's "You've Got a Friend".Hylton's debut album, Surrender, was released after her third single in the summer of 2004. In spite of securing a songwriting partnership with Eg White, and record producers Stargate, along with the singles performing relatively well, her debut album only just managed to get into the UK Albums Chart and as a result she was dropped by her record label in late 2004, despite the moderate success of the album's singles that were released on their own.Hylton featured on Richard X's 2003 album Richard X Presents His X-Factor Vol. 1. Her collaboration with him, "You Used To", was due to be released as a single, but it was cancelled.In late 2003, she became an opening act for U.S. rapper Nelly on the UK leg of his international tour.In October 2013, Hylton teamed up with DJs WAWA and M.A.R.K to release the track "Never". The song was met with widespread acclaim. Digital Spy called it an "uptempo club number", while in an 8/10 review Popjustice labelled it a "belter".


== Eurovision 2005 ==
In 2004, Hylton was the face of Dasani water, but was dropped when the product was withdrawn from the UK market due to bad publicity. On 5 March 2005, Hylton won Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up, the UK heat of the Eurovision Song Contest 2005, singing "Touch My Fire", co-written by her.  The other contestants were the 1996 UK entrant Gina G, Andy Scott-Lee, the group Tricolore, and Katie Price. During the performance, tape used to hold her dress in place came loose, causing a 'wardrobe malfunction'. Hylton went on to represent the UK in the final in Kyiv, reportedly suffering from a throat infection. With pre-final odds of 33/1, she finished with 18 points, in 22nd place, ahead of France and Germany. When "Touch My Fire" was released as a single, it became her fifth consecutive Top 20 hit, reaching Number 18 in the UK Singles Chart.
