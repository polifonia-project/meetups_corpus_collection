== History ==
Conway was born in King's Lynn, Norfolk.  
In the 1970s, he was the drummer for the band Fotheringay as well as for Eclection (other members included Kerrilee Male, Georg Kajanus [as George Hultgreen], Michael Rosen and Trevor Lucas). In their early years, Steeleye Span also drafted in the services of Conway, who was a friend of the band. Conway played on their now-classic song "Dark-Eyed Sailor" and several others from their first album, Hark! The Village Wait (1970), which album also featured contributions from Dave Mattacks, who Conway later replaced in Fairport.  His studio works also include the debut solo albums of Sandy Denny and Shelagh McDonald, and appearances on albums by Wizz Jones, John Cale, Jim Capaldi and others. He was also one of the drummers on Whatever's for Us, the debut album of Joan Armatrading in 1972. He toured and recorded as a member of Cat Stevens' band for six years.
Conway was a consistent member of the close knit Cat Stevens backing band throughout the mid-1970s. When Stevens gave up his pop music career at the close of the decade, Conway performed on Daydo; the short-lived solo album of singer-songwriter Alun Davies, another long-term member of Stevens' band. During the 1980s, Conway also toured and recorded with Kate & Anna McGarrigle.: 83 Conway joined Jethro Tull for their album Broadsword and the Beast and also played on their Grammy-award winning album Crest of a Knave.
Conway has secured the drummer's position in Fairport Convention (on a regular basis since 1998) and Pentangle (occasionally). In the years since 2006, Davies has re-joined with Stevens (now known as Yusuf Islam). Both Conway and Davies additionally play in a side project called "Good Men in the Jungle", which features Davies' daughter, Becky Moncurr.
