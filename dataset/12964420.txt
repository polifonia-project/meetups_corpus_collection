He is currently living in Palm Coast, Florida, married, and has a child. He has left Darkest Hour to pursue career options in metal production.

As of March 2011, Kris has officially joined Straight Line Stitch. "Former DARKEST HOUR guitarist Kris Norris has officially joined metalcore band Straight Line Stitch after two fill in tours. Norris has issued the following statement
"I'm excited. It's a new avenue for me. Even though they have a new record coming out soon, I can't wait to start writing and put some solos to the catchy tunes these guys write. It'll be a challenge to accent her voice but Kanky's mind-blowing drum skills will also be the perfect mix to add some nice but faster melodic work."
As of December 2011, Kris had left Straight line Stitch stating on his Facebook account "I feel that this would be appropriate to announce my departure from Straight Line Stitch" just a couple days after Seth Thacker and Kanky Lora left the band.
Kris has also teamed up yet again with Ryan Parrish, as well as Kristen Randall (ex-Winds of Plague, keyboards), Dave Sheldon (ex-Annihilator, vocals), and Pat Kavanagh (Threat Signal/Arkaea, bass) in a group called A Cancerous Affair.As of April 2012, he is currently filling in on guitar with his previous band Straight Line Stitch on their current tour with their returning original drummer and new guitarist.
