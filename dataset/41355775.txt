When he was 15 years old, he played in the junior team of a local football club. Having graduated from school, McInerney worked as a stockbroker, and in 1979 he decided to move to Germany.

== Bad Boys Blue ==

Bad Boys Blue was formed in the summer of 1984 by German producer Tony Hendrik and his lyricist wife Karin van Haaren. The original trio was composed of John McInerney, Jamaican Trevor "Supa T" Taylor (the original lead vocalist), and American Andrew Thomas.The producers looked for band members in London, but they were eventually referred to Thomas who lived in Cologne. Thomas referred Taylor, and he in turn invited McInerney.After joining the group, McInerney initially sang mostly in the chorusâ€”being in the shadow of the first lead singer at that time. Taylor then switched when McInerney sang "Come Back and Stay", which became a big hit. From that moment, McInerney gradually began singing more lead parts, and Taylor's voice became less present. After the departure of Taylor in 1989, McInerney had sung almost all the songs of the band. In January 2005, he ended his long-time collaboration with Thomas. Over the last few years, he has lived in Poland.
