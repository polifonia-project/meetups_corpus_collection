Kjell Roikjer (14 June 1901 – 19 September 1999) was a Danish composer and bassoonist who for more than 30 years was a member of the Royal Danish Orchestra (1938–1971).  He was a founder of the chamber ensemble "Blæserkvintetten af 1932" (Woodwind Quintet of 1932) and member from 1932 to 1948.  As a composer, Roikjer was very productive, writing mostly for small ensembles.  He often employed less frequently used instruments such as tuba, xylophone and saxophone.
