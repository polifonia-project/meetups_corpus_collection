Charles Curtis Berghofer (born June 14, 1937), professionally known as Chuck Berghofer, is an American jazz double bassist, who has worked as a studio musician and in the film industry for more than 60 years, including working on more than 400 movie soundtracks.


== Early life ==
Chuck Berghofer was born in Denver, Colorado, and moved with his family to Arcadia, California when he was eight. With a lineage of musicians in the family (his grandfather had played with John Philip Sousa, and his uncle played tuba with the Saint Louis Symphony), Berghofer took interest in music at an early age, playing trumpet at the age of eight.  He also played the tuba in grade school and high school until moving to the double bass at the age of 18.  As a young adult, as he began venturing out to jazz night clubs, he came to admire bassist Ralph Peña and was able to persuade Peña to take him on as a student.According to Berghofer, he always felt as though his music was heavily influenced by Leroy Vinnegar, Paul Chambers and Ray Brown. He also admired the work of Scott LaFaro and told musician and journalist Gordon Jack, "The best soloist on the instrument was Red Mitchell ... I loved to hear him solo."


== Professional career ==
Two years after he took up the bass, Berghofer, joined an orchestra, led by Skinnay Ennis for a tour of the midwest and then joined with Bobby Troup.  As his career progressed he eventually replaced his former tutor, Peña, in a duo with Pete Jolly which later expanded into a trio with the addition of drummer Nick Martinis.  In the 1960s he became a member of Shelly Manne's band, taking on a bassist position at Manne's night club Shelly's Manne-Hole and had the opportunity to play alongside numerous leading jazz musicians of the era including Jack Sheldon, Conte Candoli, Frank Rosolino, Rahsaan Roland Kirk and Philly Joe Jones. During this time, he also recorded with luminary singers such as Elvis Presley and The Everly Brothers.He was a member of the Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra around 1967 when Frank Zappa recorded the orchestral parts for Lumpy Gravy.With his lengthy career in film, Berghofer was also quite accomplished as a house jazz musician.  He formed a semi-regular house band at Donte's in Los Angeles with pianist Frank Strazzeri and drummer Nick Ceroli and was videotaped having played with Roger Kellaway and drummer Larry Bunker as they backed Zoot Sims.  Among others he accompanied were Ray Charles, Bob Cooper, Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Peggy Lee, Shelly Manne, Gerry Mulligan, Art Pepper, Frank Rosolino, Seth MacFarlane, and Frank Sinatra.In 2019, Berghofer, along with fellow Wrecking Crew members Don Randi and Don Peake and in conjunction with Denny Tedesco (producer and director of the 2008 film The Wrecking Crew), performed around the Los Angeles area with their The Wrecking Crew's Farewell to Glen Campbell live shows.


=== Film, television, and popular music ===
As Berghofer made his career as a jazz musician, he landed a prominent role recording with Nancy Sinatra in "These Boots Are Made For Walkin".  He also worked on television with Glen Campbell, recorded with Frank Sinatra, and played with Barbra Streisand, in which they did a recording of Funny Lady. His film work extends to 400 appearances, leading to his being awarded in the mid-1980s the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Award as the most valuable bass player for four consecutive years. In that decade he recorded with Mel Tormé and later recorded again with Sinatra on Duets.  During his career, Berghofer has performed on over 400 movie soundtracks. Just a few of the films he has worked on include Rocky II (1979), The Majestic (2001), Sing (2016), and Clint Eastwood’s Bird (1988). He also worked on such television shows as Barney Miller (on which he played the opening bassline), Charlie’s Angels, The Carol Burnett Show, The Simpsons and Star Trek: Enterprise.
