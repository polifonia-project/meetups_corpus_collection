Charles Giordano (born October 13, 1954) is an American keyboardist and accordionist.  Giordano is known primarily for his work with Bruce Springsteen as a member of the E Street Band, replacing Danny Federici as the band's organist following his serious illness and death in 2008 and as a member of Springsteen's The Sessions Band. He is also known for playing keyboards with Pat Benatar in the 1980s.With Benatar he was usually billed as Charlie Giordano and played for five albums, beginning in 1983; his role in the band was praised by Billboard magazine.  With Benatar he was identifiable by his glasses and distinctive array of berets, blazers and 1980s-style ties.  Giordano also was a member of The David Johansen Group and went on to perform with Buster Poindexter and The Banshees of Blue.
As a session musician Giordano's playing has included Madeleine Peyroux's 1996 album Dreamland and Bucky Pizzarelli's 2000 album Italian Intermezzo; the latter's mix of opera, Italian folk, and swing presaged his appearance in the similarly genre-mashing Sessions Band Tour with Springsteen.  Giordano also participated in a 2002 revival of garage rock band ? and the Mysterians.  In 2008, he accompanied British singer Barb Jungr for a short stand in a New York City cabaret.
