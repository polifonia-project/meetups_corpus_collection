== Biography ==


=== Background ===
Youngman created the Wolfgang Gartner name in late 1999 after establishing a successful name as a deep house DJ. Not wanting to be criticized for such an abrupt departure in style, Youngman created the name anonymously. Gartner's identity was revealed officially in July 2008. Youngman took the name from the coach of the Cal Poly Mustangs men's soccer team. The current Wolfgang Gartner logo was created in 2010 by New York graffiti artist Eric Haze who created logos for the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy and EPMD.
Gartner hosted the first episode of MTV's dance music show "Clubland" which aired on September 22, 2011. A portion of the episode was filmed at his home in Los Angeles, California, where he gave a tour of his studio and introduced music videos. He also was the DJ for the 10th Video Game Awards, which aired on Spike TV on December 7, 2012.

A total of eight of Gartner's songs have held the #1 position on the Beatport Top 10 Chart. His single "Wolfgang's 5th Symphony" was the highest selling song on Beatport.com in 2009.
