Valle was born on December 29, 1964, in Holguín, Cuba. He left Cuba in the 1990s.


== Playing style ==
An NPR reviewer of Valle's Take Off commented that "When Ramon Valle keeps it crisp, he can hardly go wrong, with percolating bass and drums at his back. But the pianist also has a more romantic, even schmaltzy side, where he tries to wow you with a ballad. Then he may show off his technique in a way that doesn't help".
