Active since 2009, D.O.D was supported at his beginning by renowned artists such as Laidback Luke, with Mixmash Records hosting most of D.O.D's productions.A collaboration between him and Laidback Luke, called "Flashing Lights", was released in April 2014.D.O.D performed at Ultra Europe in 2016. D.O.D released Blip on 7 November 2016 with which he decided to define his own genre. He dubbed this new sound "Future Jack". The song was primarily characterised by its heavy electronic sounds and repetitive nature. Many of the sounds are reminiscent of a song he released earlier that year called Taking You Back, which Afrojack worked on as well. His latest releases including Don't Wait with Tommy Trash and Ghetto all continue this sound as D.O.D tries to push forward the "Future Jack" movement.
