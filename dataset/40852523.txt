The Air Lane Trio was a musical group active in the 1940s and 1950s.  Popular over several years as a nightclub act, the group achieved minor chart success in 1947 with their recording of My Guitar Is My Sweetheart on the DeLuxe label.  This recording's top chart position was #23.  This song featured vocals by Ted Martin.

The group was organized sometime around late 1942, and was led by guitarist Tony Alessi, also known as Tony Lane.  Described as a "cocktail combo", in addition to guitar the group featured Arlo Hultz on organ and Ralph Pierce (real name Ralph Principe) on accordion or piano.  Despite being recently formed, the trio obtained a booking at the Dixie Hotel, and soon appeared on the Mutual Radio Network.  In their first year, they also appeared at Park Lane in Buffalo and Jack Dempsey's in New York.  They regularly appeared on WJZ in the mid 1940s.  By 1951 they were appearing on the ABC Radio network.

Although the group itself was instrumental, it often was paired with a featured vocalist or vocalists, such as Ted Martin or the Elm City Four.
