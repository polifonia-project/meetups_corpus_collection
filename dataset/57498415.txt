== Artistry ==


=== Dollmaking ===
Shizuka made modern ball-jointed dolls. Her dolls have been described as "haunted, ethereal-looking", "stunning", "sickly-looking", "beautiful and spooky".


=== Musical influences ===
Shizuka was prompted to compose music after seeing Maki Miura adapting a poems of hers to music. When asked about her favorite band, Shizuka cited Les Rallizes Dénudés specifically from the Japanese psychedelic scene.


=== Musical styles and voice ===
Shizuka's music, together with her band, spanned psychedelic, folk, noise rock, acid rock, and neo-psychedelia. Musical instruments she played included guitar, and bells.Shizuka possessed distinctive vocals: chanted, slow, plaintive, and tremulous, often connoting sadness and a "gothic atmosphere". Her vocals were imperfect and tuneless, but these aspects added an emotional edge as part of the band's style.
She delivers her fragile elegies in a haunted bellow, flirting with tunelessness but possessed of the same monomaniacal insistence on her own emotional dislocation as Nico. She sings "A blinding light suddenly shines out/Brighter than any star" in exactly the same tone as "I will surely go to hell/Friendless and alone".


=== Songwriting ===
Shizuka's band usual creative process started by listening to Shizuka singing lyrics, jam together, and only then arrange the song. She attributed the slow tempo in most of her music to she writing them at her natural pace, and not to a deliberate endeavor. She also said that she presented her inspirations, which in turn came from her personal experiences, in music. She wrote the song "Planning for Loneliness" (孤獨を圖る, Kodoku o Hakaru) based on her experience of having stomach cancer in the late 1980s while she also had a child who was only one and a half years old, and often performed this piece with her band because she considered it important to her.
When inspiration comes, I follow it to find the material for modelling my creative work, which may eventually be presented in the form of music or doll. Both of them are the products of my private universe, they come from the same inspiration, and all inspiration comes from my experience.


== Personal life ==
Shizuka was married to Japanese guitarist Maki Miura. She had a child in the late 1980s, and also had stomach cancer around that time.
