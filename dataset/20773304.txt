== Biography and career ==
Manus Lunny was born in Dublin and reared in Newbridge, Co. Kildare in a family which practised music regularly. He has been living in Co. Donegal for many years now, close to where his mother was born in Ranafast. He toured widely with Barry Moore (now Luka Bloom) as a teenager. He was a member of Scottish/Irish band The Wild Geese which toured Ireland and performed limited concerts in Britain. After the band took a break, Lunny began to tour with Phil Cunningham and future long-term collaborator Andy M. Stewart. They toured as a trio to begin with before branching out into other bands.Manus is best known as a member of Celtic supergroup Capercaillie. He has composed music for the BBC and various American television broadcasters and was a prominent session musician on two of Ireland's most well known compilations, Éist and Ceol Tacsi.vision recordings.In collaboration with Phil Cunningham, Lunny has written two pieces for the American record label Windham Hill.
Lunny's work also includes the album Imeall, Altan's lead singer and fiddler Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh's debut solo album and Na Mooneys, the eponymous debut album by Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh's family band called Na Mooneys.After decades of gigging and recording, Lunny finally gotten around to making a CD of his own compositions titled The Glenveagh Suite. Actually, he received a commission from the National Parks and Wildlife Services to compose music for five short films about Glenveagh National Park, its history and its conservation initiatives in County Donegal. For the album, Lunny got some of his most favourite musicians to play and sing on it: Moya Brennan, Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh, Neil Martin, Martin Crossin, Theresa Kavanagh, Donald Shaw, Ewen Vernal, Liam Bradley, Mary Crossin and Caitlin Nic Gabhann.
