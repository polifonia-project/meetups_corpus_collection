Jonah Sharp (alias Spacetime Continuum) is a producer, remixer, and DJ of electronic music. Sharp was born in Edinburgh. After starting his musical career as a jazz drummer in London, U.K., he moved to San Francisco, U.S. During the 1990s Sharp released a series of albums on the Astralwerks record label. The first of these, entitled Alien Dreamtime, featured a live recording of ethnobotanist, writer and psychedelic researcher Terence McKenna delivering a series of lectures to the accompaniment of Spacetime Continuum music.

His work has had a clear influence on contemporary psybient artists, such as Shpongle and others.
