Sometimes referred to as a "laptop musician", he received a grant from the Quebec Arts Council to record and catalogue orchestra instruments.

For the title track, he spliced together sounds that fans from around the world had sent in to him; he credits 70 contributors. An openly gay man, Bédard's song "Best Boy Electric" is a boy-on-boy duet that tells of the romance that prompted his move to Vancouver.He won a 2008 Jessie Award for Outstanding Sound Design or Original Composition, for his contribution to a production of 4.48 Psychosis.In 2012, Montag will release one single a month, all released by Carpark Records. Each single will be accompanied by a music video.
