She became exposed to other kinds of music there, and became more interested in jazz. She later obtained a PhD in music education from Teachers College, Columbia University. She then continued her studies at The New School and took jazz piano lessons from Sam Yahel.Chen's first album, Obsession, was released in 2009. This was followed three years later by another trio album, Incomplete Soul. In 2014, Chen, as "the first Taiwanese jazz artist signed to a major label", released Stranger, an album consisting largely of her original compositions.
