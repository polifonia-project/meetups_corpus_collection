Bagayogo blended his native Malian traditions with western pop music and drew comparisons to some of the great Malian musicians such as Ali Farka Touré and Toumani Diabaté.Sya, originally released in 1998, was the first album released under Six Degrees Records. The second album is titled Timbuktu, after the  ancient city in Mali. The album covers issues such as racial tolerance, regional pride, and drug abuse among youths. Bagayogo continued his fusion of his native African style music with electronic beats on this album.
