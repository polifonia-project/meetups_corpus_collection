Zep (pseudonym of Philippe Chappuis; born December 15, 1967) is a Swiss comic books creator and writer, known for his series Titeuf, a popular character in French-speaking countries, and Tchô!, the associated Franco-Belgian comics magazine.


== Biography ==
Chappuis' pseudonym derives from the first BD magazine he created at age twelve, named "Zep" in honour of Led Zeppelin (a fan of Bob Dylan, references to his musical tastes are often found in his comics). His career began with gags published in Spirou magazine in 1987, and the character Victor which started appearing in 1988.At first struggling to find publication, the series Titeuf was initially published in the fanzine Sauve qui peut ("Escape those who can") before it was noticed by Glénat executive Jean-Claude Camano. Zep joined Glénat in 1992, and first Titeuf book Dieu, le sexe et les bretelles (God, Sex And Suspenders) appeared in 1993 and sold only a few thousand copies, but the following books have gradually won over a huge readership, outselling traditional French favorites such as Astérix and Lucky Luke. Today 11 million copies of the series have been sold, and the series is considered the greatest moneymaker in the French comics market. Titeuf books have been translated into 15 languages, including Chinese, Italian and German. In the UK, Titeuf appeared under the name Tootuff in The Dandy.
Zep designed the album cover of Jean-Jacques Goldman's record Chanson pour les pieds (2001).
