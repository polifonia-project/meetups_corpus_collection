Wunder had his first music lesson at the age of four, initially learning the violin. His talent for the piano was discovered at the age of 14. He studied at the conservatories of Klagenfurt and Linz before joining the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna. A participant in the earlier 2005 International Chopin Piano Competition, Wunder failed to make the last stage. From 2008 to 2010 he studied under Adam Harasiewicz, who was himself the winner of the Chopin Competition in 1955, in preparation for the 2010 International Chopin Piano Competition.
He has performed around the world, both in solo recital and with orchestras.
In 2019, Wunder had his public conducting debut at the Rubinstein Philharmonic in Lodz, Poland. In 2020, he conducted Górecki's 3rd Symphony at the Opera Leśna.
In 2019, Wunder gave a TEDx talk about the decline in quality of music and how to get out of it. In 2021, Wunder spoke at the United Nations' IGF about the importance of quality music and music education for all of us, in a world full of technology and AI.
