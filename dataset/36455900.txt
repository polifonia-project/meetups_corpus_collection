Tha City Paper is an American rapper. He is currently signed to the Ca$hville Records record label.


== Early life ==
Growing up on the north and west side of Nashville, Tha City Paper slowly began to plant his seeds without even knowing. Around 1996â€“1997 while in high school, Paper was dating the cousin of a rapper named Pistol. He was also cool with Pistol's cousins, who were a part of a group called "PJN", whom Pistol created. Marcus Fitzgerald, Tha City Paper's name, was also a thriving young basketball player before joining the hip-hop scene.


== Music career ==


=== Solo career ===
Young Paper began to listen in a lot on the group PJN recording sessions, and slowly but surely his interest in rap was peaking. He later became a part of that group as well. Over time, he featured on plenty of Pistol's tracks, and slowly made a name for himself. He has made many songs, including, "City Paper (dope boy swagg)", and "Lil Bo Tuff" which were off his independent album Paper View.
In 2011 he dropped a mixtape entitled DOPaminE which was hosted by DJ Scream.


=== Cashville Records ===
After Young Buck heard Tha City Paper's mixtape DOPaminE he was quick to sign him to Ca$hville Records in early 2012. In the summer of 2012 both Buck and Paper linked up for a Collaboration mixtape entitled G.a.S - Gangsta and Street, this was the first project Paper released through Cashville Records since he signed to the label.
