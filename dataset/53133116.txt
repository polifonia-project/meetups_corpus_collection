In 1948 Edrisinghe was selected to be a part of Lanka Gandharva Sabha's judging panel to determine the country's national anthem. The winning entry, Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima, was a controversial selection as it was written by P. B. Elangasinha and the music was by Edrisinghe, both of whom were on the judging panel. Ultimately the government in 1951 selected Namo Namo Matha to become the national anthem.Edirsinghe then became the founding principal of the Government College of Fine Arts (Music) in October 1953, which is now known as the University of the Visual & Performing Arts.
