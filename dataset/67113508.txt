Ronald "Skip" Greer is the lead vocalist for the Dead Kennedys. Greer joined DK in 2008, replacing Jeff Penalty, and is the bands longest-serving vocalist. He was a founding member of and vocalist for the Wynona Riders from 1992 through 1996 and has also performed with East Bay Ray and the Killer Smiles, and the Lightouts.Greer is known for being a high energy performer and being physically interactive with the audience, though his vocals are throatier and less nasal than Jello Biafra's, according to The New Yorker. Greer's songwriting style has been called "more poetic" than that of his DK predecessor, though he has only written songs for the Killer Smiles. DK bassist Klaus Fluoride has said this was what the band was looking for, saying "Skip is a good singer, a good performer, but he doesn't do Biafra."
