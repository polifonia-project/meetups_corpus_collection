René Froger (born 5 November 1960 in Amsterdam), is a Dutch singer. Froger was born, and spent his first years in the Jordaan, a neighbourhood in Amsterdam. His father, Bolle Jan, had a café where Froger started performing. He started his career working with Ted de Braak and Mini en Maxi and in 1987 he released his first single, Love Leave Me.
Major success eluded him until his song Winter in America entered the Dutch Top 40 in 1988 (10 years after Australian folk Musician Doug Ashdown's original had done so). Later that year, he teamed up with the popular Dutch band Het Goede Doel to top the Dutch charts (#1 for three weeks in 1989) with Alles kan een mens gelukkig maken (Everything can make a man happy). A song for which in particular the refrain starting with Een eigen huis, een plek onder de zon (A private home, a place under the sun) morphed into a community sing-a-long evergreen.
Since 1989 he has released more singles, with mixed results.
He started the tour "Pure & More" in Amsterdam Arena, the stadium occupied by his favourite football team Ajax.
In 1997 he recorded a song with female singer Anita Doth who was part of the world-famous group 2 Unlimited. The song's title was "That's when I stop loving you"
In 2005, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, which resulted in several complications. In the same year, he stated collaborating with Gerard Joling and Gordon in the opportunity formation De Toppers. Rene represented the Netherlands at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow as part of De Toppers.
His daughter Natascha was married in 2006, and gave birth to his first grandchild later that year.
