Allan Carl Newman (born April 14, 1968) is a Canadian musician and singer–songwriter. He was a member of the indie rock bands Superconductor and Zumpano in the 1990s. Following the breakup of those bands, he reemerged as the leader of the New Pornographers in 2000, a band who have enjoyed commercial and critical success.
In 2004, Newman launched his solo career, performing as A. C. Newman. He has stated he chose "A. C." for his solo career because "it sounded like a pseudonym, but it's not a pseudonym."


== Superconductor and Zumpano ==
Newman began his musical career in the 1990s as a member of the Vancouver grunge/pop group Superconductor. During the 90s, Newman often filled in on second guitar with metal band Nemesis Gypsy. After a brief stay, he joined the Vancouver-based pop group Zumpano. The band released two albums with Newman in the mid-1990s, Look What the Rookie Did and Goin' Through Changes, both of which received favorable reviews. Though Zumpano never officially announced their breakup, they have not recorded any new material since the 90s.
Between the demise of Zumpano and the debut of the New Pornographers, Newman had an acting role in his future New Pornographers bandmate Blaine Thurier's microbudget film Low Self-Esteem Girl.

Newman is a founding member of the successful Vancouver-based power pop supergroup the New Pornographers.
