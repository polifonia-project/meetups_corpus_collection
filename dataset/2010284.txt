Johnette Napolitano (born September 22, 1957) is an American singer, songwriter and bassist best known as the lead vocalist and songwriter and bassist for the alternative rock group Concrete Blonde.


== Early life ==
Johnette Napolitano was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, the eldest of five children in an Italian American family. Though raised irreligious, Napolatino converted to Roman Catholicism as an adult.Her parents recognized their daughter possessed musical talent when, as a child, she was able to transpose "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" on piano by ear. Her mother loved show tunes. The family also listened to Johnny Cash, Marty Robbins, and the Rat Pack. At age five she enrolled in a gifted kids art program at UCLA.


== Co-founding and tenure with Concrete Blonde ==


== Solo career ==
She has also recorded as a solo artist, with the albums Sketchbook (2002), Sketchbook 2 (2006), Scarred (2007), and Sketchbook 3 (2010), and as a member of:

Dream 6 (a precursor to Concrete Blonde).
Vowel Movement, a side project; a semi-improvisational musical collaboration with Holly Beth Vincent.
Pretty & Twisted, a side project; a band that also featured former Wall of Voodoo guitarist Marc Moreland.
Lead singer for the album tour for The Heads, the re-formed Talking Heads' project, with Jerry Harrison, Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth. She is featured on the 1996 album No Talking, Just Head, including the single "Damage I've Done". This was, at the time, intended to turn into a full-time project, with further studio albums and tours. A live CD-video of the first tour was planned, featuring performances from many of the album's guest artists and Napolitano on vocals for the songs originally recorded by Talking Heads.  David Byrne sued the band, saying their name and presentation was too evocative of Talking Heads, and put an end to those plans.
Napolitano also recorded a solo album titled Sound of a Woman around 1996–1997, and performed many of the songs on a solo tour opening for Paul Weller. The album was set to be released on IRS (a subdivision of Island Records), the label of her old band, Concrete Blonde. 1997–1998 was a bad time for Island, starting with the sudden departure of founder-CEO Chris Blackwell and ending with the total reorganization of the label. Sound of a Woman was, effectively, lost in the shuffle, and at this point is unlikely to ever be officially released. Bootleg copies of this album are rare and highly valued.Napolitano is a resident of Joshua Tree, California.
She composes music for films and works as a gallery artist, specializing in working with discarded and reclaimed materials. She also takes care of rescue horses.
