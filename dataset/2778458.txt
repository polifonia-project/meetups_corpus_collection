== Early life and education ==

== Music career ==


=== Bang Chamber 8 ===
Pop (then still going by his real name) played in a Depeche Mode cover band called Bang Chamber 8 with Mike Bowe (later known as Daddy Long Legs). Pop played guitar, while Bowe played bass and sang. In 1990, Bang Chamber 8 released a cassette of four original songs: "Wouldn't It Be Nice", "Birthday Boy", "Ice Cubes" and "War Chimes". These songs had nothing in common, lyrically or musically, with the Bloodhound Gang. "War Chimes" was written about Operation Desert Storm and featured a guitar solo from Pop at the end, who also provided the lead vocals. The synth line from "Birthday Boy" would be reused on a Bloodhound Gang track, "I'm the Least You Could Do", in 2005.
Bang Chamber 8 split in 1991. In 1992, Pop and Daddy started a hip hop group called the Bloodhound Gang which later became more of an alternative rock band. Daddy Long Legs left the Bloodhound Gang to start Wolfpac in 1997.
