== Biography ==
He was born Michael Robert Green, in Matlock, Derbyshire. Green began his career in 1956, playing in a skiffle trio "The Wayfaring Strangers" with Johnny Spence and Frank Farley, who came second in a bands competition to The Quarrymen. The trio then all joined Red-E-Lewis and the Redcaps, who became the Redcaps, backing Cuddly Dudley, when Reddy Lewis left. Spence, Farley and Green joined Johnny Kidd & the Pirates in 1962, but then Green left to join Billy J. Kramer with The Dakotas in 1964. His ability to play lead and rhythm guitar simultaneously influenced a number of British guitarists to follow, including Pete Townshend and Wilko Johnson, the original guitarist for Dr. Feelgood. Green's song "Oyeh!" was on Dr. Feelgood's debut album, Down by the Jetty; and a song he co-wrote, "Going Back Home" appeared on Dr. Feelgood's 1975 Malpractice and the live album, Stupidity (1976). Green was also a member of the band Shanghai, which released two albums, in 1974 and 1976, other members included, Chuck Bedford (vocals, harmonica, 1974–1975), Pete Kircher (drums, vocals), Mike Le Main (bass, keyboards, 1974–1975), Cliff Bennett of Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers (vocals, 1975–1976), Brian Alterman (guitar, 1975–1976), Pat King (bass, 1975–1976).
Green reformed the Pirates with Farley and Spence in 1976 (Kidd having died in 1966). Over the next five years they became one of the hardest-gigging bands on the road and released four albums: "Out of Their Skulls" (1977), "Skull Wars" (1978), "Happy Birthday Rock'n'Roll" (1979) and the ten-inch "A Fistful of Dubloons" (1981). Green played the Fender Telecaster Custom produced in 1972 as his main guitar.
Green was also a member of the band Shanghai, which released two albums, in 1974 and 1976, and supported Status Quo on their Blue for You tour. Together with Quo member Alan Lancaster he wrote four songs recorded by Status Quo.In the 1980s and 1990s, Green played with, amongst others, Bryan Ferry, Van Morrison, Paul McCartney, Robert Plant and Lemmy, as well as the Pirates, with whom he continued to gig well into the 2000s. His other notable gigs included playing guitar for Van Morrison on the Pyramid Stage at the Glastonbury Festival in 2005, and with David Gilmour and Paul McCartney at the latter's return to the Cavern Club in support of his Run Devil Run album in 1999.
In his spare time he taught guitar privately, as well as at various local schools.
In 1990, Green played guitar with Lemmy and the Upsetters on their "Blue Suede Shoes" / "Paradise" single. The A-side was originally recorded for a charity album, and Green wrote the B-side with Motorhead's Lemmy Kilmister for this occasional Upsetters project.
From 1999 to 2008, Green performed regularly with the Van Morrison band. He played guitar on 1999's Back on Top and he appeared on his other studio albums up until he was on five of the tracks on Van Morrison's 2008 album, Keep It Simple.
In 2007, he did a six track mini-album, Cutthroat and Dangerous in Finland with the Finnish rock'n'roll trio, Doctor's Order.
In February 2004, while on stage with Bryan Ferry in Auckland, New Zealand, Green suffered a cardiac arrest. His life was saved by two doctors in the crowd and following his return to England and recovery he carried on playing. He suffered kidney problems in February 2009, partly connected with his earlier heart problem.
