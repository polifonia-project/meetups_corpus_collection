He started his career in 1978 as an original member of the new wave/power pop outfit the Sinceros, who were signed to Epic Records and released a string of successful albums. Around this time, he also played with Lene Lovich and Bill Nelson, before he joined Squeeze in 1982, replacing Paul Carrack. At this time, he recorded with drummer Chris Whitten as the Catch, releasing the single "25 Years" which reached number 3 on the German charts, sold half a million copies and stayed on the charts for 40 weeks. He also recorded with artists such as Judie Tzuke, Tracey Ullman, Nik Kershaw, ABC and Sheila Walsh.
In 1987, he joined Tina Turner for her Break Every Rule World Tour and recorded the album Live in Europe. He also recorded with Roger Daltrey, Tom Jones, Jimmy Somerville, Chris Eaton, Holly Johnson, Boy George, Jaki Graham and Gary Moore. On 11 June 1988, Snow played the first Nelson Mandela benefit at the Wembley Arena along with Al Green, Joe Cocker, Natalie Cole, Jonathan Butler, Freddie Jackson, and Ashford & Simpson.
In 1990, Snow played with the John Lennon tribute band in Liverpool, before he re-joined Squeeze in 1991 for touring. In 1992, after appearing on records by Tina Turner, Judie Tzuke, Thomas Anders and Heartland, he played keyboards for Procol Harum and later played for Van Morrison. He joined Squeeze for the third time in 1995 and played with Morrison again in 1998.
Since 2000, he has recorded releases with Kylie Minogue, Melanie C, Joe Cocker, Mark Owen, Michael Ball, released several solo albums and recently produced Alexis Cunningham.
