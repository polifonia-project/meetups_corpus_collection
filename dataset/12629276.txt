== Biography ==
Shive's parents were "intentional future community" people; her mother called her Running Pony until she was about six years old, and regularly changed her name. Shive eventually chose one of them, Madigan, as her permanent name when she was a teenager. The family lived in a teepee in Washington for about two years when she was a child, and moved often. She learned to play cello from age nine.In 1992 at age seventeen she formed the Seattle based duo Tattle Tale with Jen Wood. Tattle Tale were a part of the riot grrrl movement. They released an album, Tattle Tale, on the Kill Rock Stars label and an album on St. Francis Records. The band broke up in 1995.
In 1995 Shive formed her own artist run music label, MoonPuss Music and began solo releases as Madigan. She released the Rock Stop EP in 1996. The song "Pity Rock" from the EP featured in the film Sleeping Beauties by Jamie Babbit. Babbit also used Tattle Tale's "Glass Vase Cello Case" as the love theme in her film But I'm a Cheerleader (1999). In 1996 Shive also released the Fortunes From The F-Holes album.
In 1997 she formed the ensemble project Bonfire Madigan with original members contrabassist Sheri Ozeki, guitarist Shelley Doty, and percussionist Tomas (Tomas Palermo). The music has been described as "mixes classical stringed elements with modern beats and percussion into a punk-influenced, emotional concoction." Bonfire Madigan continues as a collaborative effort with other rotating musicians.
In 2001 Shive made news while raising money to fight tenant eviction and trying to raise awareness of tenant's and poor peoples' rights.Shive says she has been actively hearing voices and having experiences of what mainstream psychiatry would call delusions but that she frames differently, including mood extremes, all her life. In 2003 she became a founding collective member of The Icarus Project alongside Sascha Scatter, Jacks Ashley McNamara and Will Hall. The Icarus Project is a mental health movement characterized by the view that many phenomena commonly labeled as mental illness should instead be regarded as "dangerous gifts". She has said "We see our madness as a dangerous gift to be cultivated and taken care of, not a disease to be cured".In 2008 Shive was a contributing author to the anthology Live Through This: On Creativity and Self-Destruction on Seven Stories Press.
Shive has made symphonic pieces and performances for live theatre and film since 2006. Chad Jones, reviewing her performance in 'Tis Pity She's a Whore at the American Conservatory Theater for SF Theatre Examiner, wrote "What makes the play worth seeing is the live music provided by punk cellist/vocalist Bonfire Madigan Shive, a fascinating performer who connects to the play more viscerally than the actors."She is based in the Mexico / US border region of California.
