Tao wanted to give her a spot in A class; however, following Ella Chen's suggestion, Chaoyue ended up being assigned into C class. When the first episode was aired, Chaoyue soon gained a huge popularity and was voted into A class. This resulted in debate and put her on multiple Weibo trending topics. Finally, hateful comments emerged all around Weibo, degrading her stage performances and her personality, and turned into a widespread case of cyberbullying. After finishing third in the final episode, Chaoyue was once again the most-searched topic on Weibo and was a trending keyword on Baidu, China's largest search engine.Some netizens anonymously reported Chaoyue to the Ministry of Culture, claiming that she did not have any singing or dancing talent and that allowing her to debut in Rocket Girls 101, "violates the Core Socialist Values". Wang Sicong, son of tycoon Wang Jianlin, also criticised Chaoyue and made her a trending topic on Weibo once again.
