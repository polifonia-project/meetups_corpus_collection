At the age of 13 he appeared in the stage play The Stone Jungle.Tamblyn was given a role in The Kid from Cleveland (1949), billed third (as "Rusty Tamblyn") under stars George Brent and Lynn Bari.

His first role under the new contract was as a young soldier in boot camp in Take the High Ground! (1953), directed by Richard Brooks. His training as a gymnast in high school, and abilities as an acrobat, prepared him for his breakout role as Gideon, the youngest brother, in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954).He was not a trained dancer and always considered himself an actor who danced rather than the other way around but the film was a big success and established him at MGM. Tamblyn was one of many studio contract players in the musical Deep in My Heart (1954). He played Eleanor Parker's brother in the Western Many Rivers to Cross (1955), and was one of several young MGM actors (others included Jane Powell and Debbie Reynolds) in the musical Hit the Deck (1955).

Tamblyn supported older actors in two Westerns: Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger in The Last Hunt (1956), a flop; and Glenn Ford and Broderick Crawford in The Fastest Gun Alive (1956), a big hit, where he performed an extraordinary "shovel" dance at a hoe-down early in the film. He served (uncredited) as a choreographer for Elvis Presley in 1957's Jailhouse Rock. MGM loaned Tamblyn to Allied Artists for his first star role, The Young Guns (1957).

There were complications following the surgery and during the rehabilitation, although his health had reportedly improved as of February 2015.In June 2021, Amber Tamblyn wrote an essay in The New York Times expressing solidarity with Britney Spears' effort to end the conservatorship controlling her life. Tamblyn wrote that she became financially successful when she  turned 21 and starred in Joan of Arcadia. Her father became her co-manager and her mother her business manager. She wrote that having her parents on the payroll complicated their relationship. She wrote that having money at such a young age also complicated other relationships with relatives, friends and romantic partners, that she was "everybody's A.T.M." and that her money "paid for our vacations, dinners out, and sometimes even the bills.." The essay goes on to explain the close bond she still shares with her parents, despite those early difficult years. "My mom taught me everything I know about money management, from balancing checkbooks to coding my business expenses in my credit card statements. My father was a fiercely protective advocate."
