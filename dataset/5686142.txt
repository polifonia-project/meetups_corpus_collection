Over the next few years, D'Anda played in bands around East L.A. and the Sunset Strip honing his chops until, one day, he was summoned to audition for the band BulletBoys.  He got the gig, and the band later signed to Warner Bros. Records.
D'Anda and the band released three records with Warner Bros., performed a track featured on the Wayne's World soundtrack, and toured the world with the likes of Cheap Trick, Ozzy, Bon Jovi, Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson, Living Colour, Tesla, Cinderella, Poison and Winger.  BulletBoys songs and videos are still played on outlets such as: VH-1, Sirius-XM radio, Last.fm, iLike, Yahoo Music, AOL, Pandora, Rhapsody and Music Choice.
