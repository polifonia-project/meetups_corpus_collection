Carlo Siliotto (born 10 January 1950) is an Italian film composer.


== Early life and career ==
Carlo Siliotto was born in Rome in 1950. He began playing guitar and violin at an early age, and pursued formal studies in composition at the Conservatory of Frosinone under the direction of Maestro Daniele Paris.
He was among the founders of the popular folk band Canzoniere del Lazio (1973-1980). The group released six albums, revisiting traditional songs and music from Southern Italy and mixing musical styles, particularly combining rock, jazz and classical music with Mediterranean and ethnic music. Over the course of its lifespan Canzoniere del Lazio went on several national and international tours, performing across Europe and in several African countries, such as Somalia, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia, Kenya.
After the dissolution of Canzoniere, Siliotto released a concept album Ondina (Polygram), and took a leading role as violinist and composer for Carnascialia, a project involving several prominent artists in the Italian folk scene of the period. In 1980 he founded a new ensemble, Gramigna, performing on tour in Greece, Italy, Hungary, Germany, Nigeria and Mozambique. Between 1980 and 1984 Siliotto worked as violinist, composer and arranger on many albums by artists such as Domenico Modugno, Antonello Venditti, Francesco De Gregori and others.
