Her debut single "Skinny Genes" was released on 12 April 2010, reaching No. 22 in the UK Singles Chart.

In an interview with Elle magazine in April 2013, she stated "I'm definitely showing more of myself than I ever have before.  I feel like on my last album, I hadn't experienced very much of anything really, and it's been three years or more since then and I have felt and seen things I hadn't before, and I know things I didn't know before.  In a way I have answers to questions, but then those answers open up a thousand other questions. I guess I've gone through things that so many people go through at the age I am. I've written almost every day about my every thought and emotion and the album is made up of the songs that mean the most to me".
