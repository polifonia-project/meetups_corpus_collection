== Music ==
Niasony performs a style of world music in the genres of Soukous, Afro, Reggae and Afrobeat. Thematically, Niasony combines the sounds of dance music with serious topics of her homeland, including poverty and gender-based violence. She calls this style "Afroplastique" and has explained, "AFRO represents my roots and PLASTIQUE the poverty I'll never forget — my first pair of sandals was plastic." About her music, she has said, "Dancing in the rain is better than waiting for the sun."Some of Niasony's music is in response to the 2007 deportation of her brother by German authorities back to the war-torn Republic of the Congo. Her 2014 debut album Afroplastique features club music sung in her native language of Lingala. Niasony has stated that she views her album and her stage performances as "therapy."
