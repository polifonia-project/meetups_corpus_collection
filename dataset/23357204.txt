== Early life ==
Willy Northpole was born William Adams on February 22, 1980, in Phoenix, Arizona. A flood that day forced him to be born in a helicopter, which also gave him his first nickname, "Helicopter Baby".
Music has always been a part of Willy Northpole's life. Growing up a Michael Jackson fan, he was influenced early on by rap pioneers such as Kool Moe Dee and Too Short. Once his mother noticed her son's abilities as a performer she began entering him in talent shows on Phoenix's south side. While he was entering talent shows his father was on the streets; addicted to crack. During this time it was not unusual for Willy to see drug dealers in and around looking for his father. Willyâ€™s cousin Walter "Salt" Morison, who was a known member of Broadway Gangsta's, a gang associated with the blood gangs of Phoenix, was shot 21 times and killed on August 23, 1992.


== Career ==
Upon his release at the age of 18, Willy Northpole set out to enter the music industry. Splitting his time between working and the recording studio, Willy began writing rhymes about his experiences and the world around him. After recording the song "Garbage Disposal", which became a local hit, Willy Northpole hooked up with a rival local emcee named Hot Rod. At the time, Hot Rod was being pursued by G-Unit and asked Willy to come along as his right-hand man. Willy then reconnected with his childhood friend Tiffany J., a one-time Power 92.3 on-air personality now turned producer and artist manager under Blue Williams at Family Tree Entertainment.
In 2007, he signed with Disturbing Tha Peace / Def Jam, becoming the only rap artist signed with the label from the western United States. He was also the only rapper signed with major distribution that was born and raised in Phoenix. In 2012, Willy Northpole left Disturbing Tha Peace.
Willy has recorded with rappers and producers including Ez Elpee, Shondrae of Bangladesh productions, Trak Starz, Heatmakerz, Reefa, and Nitti.
