He lived in Belgium and Ireland, before settling in London. He turned down the chance to play bass on Marvin Gaye's 1982 comeback album, Midnight Love, because he was so busy recording and he said that he was not aware that it would be the last album released during Gaye's lifetime.  After his bass talents were recognized, he was invited to join the UK pop group, Wham!.  He went on to tour China with Wham! and later backed Wham! frontman George Michael on his Faith tour.
