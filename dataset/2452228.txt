In 1979 as a teen  Jay was introduced to the big Stage touring with R&B Legend Al Wilson ("Show and Tell") supporting The Ohio Players.  After moving to Los Angeles in 1981 Jay broke into the LA session scene and played local stages with former Yes guitarist Peter Banks' band and National arenas with Danny Johnson and The Bandits supporting ZZ Top. In 1982, Schellen was invited to join English pop band Badfinger joining Tommy Evans, Joey Molland, Glen Sherba and Yes keyboardist Tony Kaye.
In 1984, Schellen joined Stone Fury, working with singer Lenny Wolf and guitarist Bruce Gowdy. From 1985 to 1991, he joined the melodic rock group Hurricane. Hurricane went on to record three records, Take What You Want, Over the Edge and Slave to the Thrill, 3 worldwide tours and posted two top ten MTV videos. In 1993, Schellen joined Gowdy in a new melodic rock project, Unruly Child, releasing a self-titled CD. Schellen again worked with Gowdy in 1995, joining World Trade for their second album Euphoria, alongside Billy Sherwood (later in Yes). Schellen and Sherwood were the only members of World Trade for appearances on two tribute albums released on the Magna Carta record label in 1995.
In 1995–1997, Schellen formed Sircle of Silence with singer David Reece (ex-Accept, ex-Bangalore Choir), guitarist Larry Farkas (ex-Vengeance Rising, ex-Die Happy) and bass guitarist Greg Chaisson (ex-Badlands). In 1997, Schellen published his well regarded drum method book Rocking Independence.

In 2003, Schellen re-joined Conspiracy, recording The Unknown, followed by a live-in-the-studio DVD recorded in 2004 and released in 2006. Schellen has continued to work with Sherwood on a number of other projects including joining progressive group Circa in 2008 (replacing Alan White), thus re-joining Tony Kaye again on keyboards and Jimmy Haun on guitars. They released Circa HQ in January 2009. He also worked with Yoso in the band's initial stages, again working with Sherwood and Kaye. In 2010 Jay joined Sherwood,  Jimmy Haun and Kaye again to perform "Headsets" in collaboration with legendary Rock and Roll DJ  Jim Ladd staged at the Laserium in Los Angeles, California.
In 2004, Schellen with Sherwood worked on pre-production for Asia's album Silent Nation with Geoff Downes (another former Yes keyboardist). In August 2005, Schellen replaced Chris Slade as the drummer in Asia. The group toured Europe extensively and released a live recording, however, in 2006, Downes left the line up for a reunion of the original founding members Asia quartet: Schellen and the other two Asia band members, singer John Payne and guitarist Guthrie Govan, formed a new band, GPS. GPS released their debut CD Window to the Soul. In 2008, Asia Featuring John Payne was formed with Payne, Govan, keyboardist Erik Norlander, and Schellen on drums. An album was released under the new name of Dukes of the Orient. Unruly Child has also reunited.
