=== Drug arrest and trial ===
On November 16, 2019, Sawajiri was arrested on suspicion of possessing MDMA at her home. She reportedly admitted to using drugs for the past 10 years, including marijuana, LSD and cocaine.

== Public image ==
During the premiere for Closed Note on September 29, 2007, Sawajiri, seemingly unhappy with the film, gave terse answers to the reporters. Subsequently, her actions were widely criticized for disrespecting her co-stars and the staff of the film. She issued an apology on her website and during her interview on Super Morning, where she also denied the rumors that she was being suspended by her management. The incident, compounded with Sawajiri's relationship with Takashiro, affected her public image greatly, and she withdrew her appearance at the Busan International Film Festival because of it. She later abruptly put her acting career on hiatus and Stardust Promotion eventually dropped her as an act in 2009. On September 1, 2010, in an interview with CNN Go, Sawajiri regretted apologizing and claimed that her management had pressured her to do so. Since the incident, the phrase "None, really" (別に, Betsu ni), one of her responses to the reporters, became a viral phenomenon, and she was featured in a Snickers commercial in 2011 parodying herself.
