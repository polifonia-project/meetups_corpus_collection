The album was received positively by critics. Ed Placencia of the website Comedy Reviews praised Maddock for his "great sense of balance" in making jokes about extreme topics without being offensive, but also noted that shock only formed a small part of Maddock's act, which draws on what Placencia called an "endless well" of stories about his life and family. Richard Lanoie of The Serious Comedy Site called it "excellent." Jake Austen of Roctober magazine also praised Maddock's ability to find jokes in potenttially shocking, offensive topics, calling him "very funny" with a "special, wacky twist."Country Music Legend was released October 2, 2020. The title came from Maddock's ironic way of introducing himself at clubs, but also reflects that he plays guitar on stage to accompany his jokes with music. The stand-up on the album is bookended by two songs performed by Maddock with a live band.
