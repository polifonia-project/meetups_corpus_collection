I was in a black-music history class with Chuck D., [future Def Jam president] Bill Stephney, and [journalist] Harry Allen at Adelphi University. Bill was hosting The Mr. Bill Show on [Adelphi student station] 90.3 FM WBAU, and they brought me up there. And that's where I met Flavor Flav, who at the time was 'MC DJ Flavor.' I started a show called The Operating Room, where I interviewed people like Run-DMC, and we used to make songs which we played as promos for the show. Jam Master Jay encouraged me to take what we were doing to Russell Simmons. I went to see Rick Rubin, down at NYU, and I played him this promo called “Knowledge Me,” where we talked about all the shows [on WBAU].
