== Early life ==
Kippi Rolynn Binkley was born in Nashville, Tennessee. A singer and musician at an early age, she began singing professionally before she was a teenager. At age 12, she gave a performance at a local shopping mall, when an executive for MCA Records discovered her. With the help of record producer Chuck Howard, Jr., Kippi was signed to MCA in 1981. Her surname was altered to Brannon, after Brannon Auto Parts, a local automotive parts store.


== Career ==
Brannon charted three singles in the early 1980s, in addition to receiving a New Female Vocalist of the Year nomination from the Academy of Country Music. She was also signed as an opening act for other country artists. Although she was gaining in popularity, Brannon decided to leave her career and attend college, first at Belmont University and later at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. During her hiatus from the country music scene, she also married and had a daughter, Kasey; she later divorced and married a second time.By 1988, Brannon resumed her music career, signing to Curb Records this time around. Her first single for the label, "I Ain't Never", failed to make the charts upon its 1992 release. Working with producers Matt Rollings and James Stroud, she began a search for additional songs to record; however, by the end of 1992, she once again had to take a hiatus, as she had divorced a second time, and had to care for her ailing father. Her first album, I'd Be with You, was released in early 1997, under the production of Mark Bright. Brannon has not recorded since.
