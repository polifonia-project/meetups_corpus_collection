In 1997, Edele and her twin sister Keavy formed the girl group Butterfly Farm with their friend Sinéad O'Carroll. The trio began writing and recording together, but soon realised that there was "someone missing". Upon Keavy's suggestion, they asked Armaou to come for an audition and she played a tape recording of a song she had written. The other girls liked it and Lindsay became the fourth member of the group, who later changed their name to B*Witched.
After the split, Edele joined for the songwriting/production team Xenomania. She co-wrote "Some Kind of Miracle" for Girls Aloud's debut album Sound of the Underground, and "Buster", "Situation's Heavy" and "Twisted" for the Sugababes' third album Three. In 2006, Edele and Keavy created a duo group going by the name of Ms Lynch, until December 2009 when they were officially rebranded as "Barbarellas". Edele confirmed on Facebook in late 2012 that the Barbarellas project had come to an end before reuniting with B*Witched.
