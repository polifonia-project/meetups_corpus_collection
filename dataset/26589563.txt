Holly Miranda (born 21 September 1982) is an American singer-songwriter and musician. Besides being trained in piano, Holly is a self-taught guitar and trumpet player. In 2001, she recorded High Above The City, a 20-track solo album available only at shows. In the fall of 2003, Holly met and teamed up with Alex Lipsen, producer and keys player. The project evolved into The Jealous Girlfriends, a four-piece band based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.


== Early life ==
Miranda grew up singing in church, in Detroit, learning piano at age six and picking up the guitar at 14, around the time she began writing songs. At the age of 16, she moved to New York City, dropping out of high school and finishing her degree through correspondence. She earned a deal with major label BMG at the age of 17, but the music she recorded for them was never released. Miranda commented on this, saying: "I ended up walking away from [it]. It's, like, in a safe somewhere and no one's ever heard it."

== Personal life ==
Miranda is a lesbian, but she doesn't like to label herself when it comes to being talked about as a musician. "I have no problem being out, but I don't think it has anything to do with my music", Miranda said. "I like who I like. I don't want people to not listen to my music because of that and I don't want people to listen to my music because of that. I haven't had to deal with it in a professional way very much yet."
