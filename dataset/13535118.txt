=== The Barbarians ===
Asad started his music career in 1987 with The Barbarians, which is regarded by many as Pakistan's first rock band. The band's first single "Yeh Zindagi Hai" (This is Life) set the foundation of Pakistani rock. They got their first big break when The Barbarians participated in "Rock vs. Rock" show at the Taj Mahal (Agrah, India) and won a prize of 20,000 Rupees.
They released their only album, the self-titled "The Barbarians" in 1989, which did not fare well in the then rock-repellant Pakistani music industry. The Barbarians fell apart in 1990.


=== Junoon and Vital Signs ===
Asad did a gig with Salman Ahmad of Junoon at a party in 1991. On Salman's invitation, he hopped on board with Junoon and played bass with them for about a year.
In a performance at Marriott Islamabad in November 1992, he met Haroon and Faakhir of Awaz and Rohail Hyatt of Vital Signs. This led to his performances on Vital Signs' Aitebar and Hum Tum .


=== Awaz ===
Awaz was formed in December 1992, by Haroon, Faakhir and Asad. The band went on to become the next best thing in Pakistani pop scene after Vital Signs.
Awaz were highly skilled and talented musicians, producers and composers.  The band's skill at composing and producing was often overlooked and the focus was on their good looks, glossy videos, catch songs and wild stage performances.
Awaz was the first band from Pakistan to appear on MTV on 20 April 1992 with the song Janeman. Awaz released three albums. The first album was the self-titled album Awaz, more commonly known as Awaz 1. The second album was Jadu Ka Chiraagh and the third and last album was Shola.
After Shola, the band fell apart due to the differences among the three and they went their ways. Haroon and Faakhir started their solo careers. Awaz has sold over 3 million albums worldwide.


=== Karavan ===
In 1997, foreseeing a disintegrating Awaz, Asad established his own studio. Simultaneously, he joined hands with Sameer Ahmed to form Karavan, thus returning to his rock origins. They brought the already established solo singer Najam Sheraz as the first vocalist and Alan Smith as drummer to complete the line-up. In 1999, Najam Shiraz returned to his solo career, vacating the vocalist's slot for newcomer Tanseer Daar. Karavan released Rakh Aas in 1997, Safar in 1999 and Gardish in 2002. In 2005, The band issued an internet only Unplugged album which had over 100,000 downloads. Karavan released their fourth and final studio album, Saara Jahan in 2010. The band broke up in 2012.
