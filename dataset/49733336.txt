Christoph H. Müller (born 1967) is a Swiss musician, composer, producer and audio engineer.
He is best known as the co-founder of the electronica/neotango band Gotan Project.


== Biography ==
As a teenager, Müller was part of different bands, including Touch El Arab, whose song "Muhammar" became a top 5 hit in Switzerland in 1987.After studies at the Universities of Basel and Zürich he moved to Paris to study at "Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales". At the same time he continued music and founded together with Paris-based American singer/songwriter Gabriela Arnon the band Ten Mother Tongues. They released one album in 1997, called The Listening Tree.In 1995 he started a close collaboration with French label Ya Basta records. He released tracks under such names as "The Boyz from Brazil", "Stereo Action Unlimited", and "Fruit of the loop" and worked on music for short films, TV jingles and advertising.In 1999 he co-founded, together with Argentinean musician Eduardo Makaroff and French producer Philippe Cohen Solal, Gotan Project, whose new form of Argentinean tango has had huge success all over the world. They released three albums: La Revancha del Tango (2001), Lunatico (2006) and Tango 3.0 (2010), and did three successful world tours, until the fall of 2011.At the same time, Müller founded his own production company, March:Music, in 2004 to develop his other musical projects, like his solo project Roy Dubb and – together with Afro Peruvian musicians – the project RADIOKIJADA, whose first album Nuevos Sonidos Afro Peruanos was released in 2009 on Wrasse records. The album garnered rave reviews in the UK, and the band played at the WOMAD festival in Reading, being one of the highlights, according to The Guardian.In 2005 he co-composed with Eduardo Makaroff the original music for Not Here to Be Loved, a film by Stéphane Brizé, and in 2007/2008 the soundtrack for El Gaucho, a documentary fiction film by Argentinean director Andres Jarach. The composer/producer duo "Müller & Makaroff" was thus born.In 2012/2013 Müller & Makaroff wrote music for the short film Reencuentro by Argentinean director Pablo Giorgelli (Camera d’or in Cannes for his film Las Acacias) and for Evita, a radio lecture by French actress Jeanne Moreau of a script by Pablo Aguero.
Also in 2012 he started a collaboration with electronic music icon Hans-Joachim Roedelius (from Krautrock band Cluster). They played live together in Paris and in Lunz (Austria).
In 2014 he released an album of songs written by Müller & Makaroff interpreted by French singer Catherine Ringer from the cult band Les Rita Mitsouko entitled Plaza Francia: A new Tango Songbook. The album was well received by critics and the public.
This was followed by an extensive French/European tour with Plaza Francia.In 2015, the first album of his collaboration with Roedelius, Imagori, was released by Groenland Records.In 2017 Plaza Francia changed its name and became the Plaza Francia Orchestra. In 2018, the Plaza Francia Orchestra released a self-titled album featuring Cap Verdean singer Lura and Catherine Ringer.
Also in 2018, Müller released the second album of his collaboration with Roedelius, Imagori II.
Since 2020 he is developing - together with Eduardo Makaroff - a new project called "ANTROPOCENO! music & science", for which they collaborate with different artists as well as the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and UNDRR (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction)
