== Biography ==
Heller traces his musical and drumming influences across many genres, including gospel, Latin jazz and funk. He has been known to incorporate these styles into his death metal compositions, although they can be difficult to recognize when played at death metal tempos. Heller teaches current and aspiring extreme metal drummers and writes columns for Sick Drummer magazine. He is known as a talented linear player, a style which involves the use of two or more limbs, with no two limbs playing at the same time. Heller plays session drums and has collaborated with artists in disparate styles. He joined the Yonkers, New York-based technical death metal band Malignancy in 2003, replacing Roger J. Beaujard. In 2008, he started the band System Divide with the Aborted vocalist Sven de Caluwé and the ex-Distorted vocalist Miri Milman. Heller joined Fear Factory in 2012 after the departure of Gene Hoglan. Heller performed on the 2020 debut album by Amahiru, a musical project led by Frédéric Leclercq and Saki.
