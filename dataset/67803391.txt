Janiak is a relative of the actor William Campbell. Janiak had a major interest in horror films and occult books during his youth. Janiak described himself to Metal Transistor as "a strange kid that felt like he couldn't fit in anywhere".Janiak started skateboarding at a young age, and eventually would start skating competitively winning numerous competitions which would land him a sponsorship. Janiak was than recruited by local pro skateboarder Jeff Jones to ride for his demo team, which would see Janiak doing skate demos around the tri-state area.His introduction to music started when he began listening to his parents records and his mother gave him her copy of The Monster Mash. By the age of ten, Janiak was introduced to punk rock music through skateboarding, than later hearing the Dead Kennedys Plastic Surgery Disasters album which ultimately gained his attention to the genre. At the age of 13, Janiak attended his first punk rock gig watching Ramones at City Gardens in Trenton, New Jersey.Janiak's introduction to playing music began at the age of 12 when he taught himself how to play the drums, than at the age of 14, he started his first band Chaotic Discharge.

After the gig, Janiak than hitched a ride to the Lower East Side of Manhattan where he had got involved in the anarcho punk scene and ended up squatting in an abandoned community building until it was shut down by the NYPD. After the squat was shut, Janiak than spent the remainder of his time in New York City living in and around Tompkins Square Park. During this time, he developed a drug addiction which would last from his late teens to his mid twenties. His whereabouts were discovered when he was seen on a news report about the anniversary of the 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot.
