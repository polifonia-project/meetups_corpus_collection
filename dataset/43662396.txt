== Beginnings ==
Raef picked up playing guitar during his time at the University of Maryland, College Park where he studied computer science.After graduation, Raef worked briefly as a software engineer before leaving to teach high school for eight years. As he says:
"I decided to switch careers from a software eng. to a high school teacher because I wanted to help others in a more direct way (and because it was pretty boring sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours a day)". Raef taught computer programming in Montgomery County Public Schools.

Teaching gave Raef more time to focus on songwriting, often performing at local coffee shops and busking at metro stations. He was introduced to the national stage after his trio rock band "Great Seneca" toured the United States of America as part of the "Voices for Change" initiative. Raef also joined the "Poetic Vision Tour"; a band of traveling musicians and poets catering to the American Muslim community. Raef did several Muslim-themed covers of popular mainstream songs, attracting young listeners wanting a modern take on religious musicRaef signed with Awakening Records and released his debut album The Path in 2014. In the summer of 2019 he released his second album Mercy with a notable shift towards rock and country music.
