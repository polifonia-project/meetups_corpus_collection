== Life and musical career ==


=== Early life and career ===
Mednas, who derives his moniker from a mix-up of his given name, Mehdi Nassiri, was born in Casablanca and raised in Marrakesh and Tangier, Morocco.Mednas always had an innate sense of music. He went to the conservatory at an early age to learn piano, but decided to teach it to himself, along with guitar. He replayed all of his favorite songs by ear. From that time on, he fell in love with music and started to learn about many musical genres, including Disco/Funk. His uncle was a big fan of 70's music, which inspired Mednas to take an interest in these two genres. Year after year, Mednas discovered more and more bands, artists and music styles, which helped him acquire a diverse musical background.
Mednas became exposed to the world of recording through his mother, who at that time was a sound engineer for the Moroccan Radio. He was known by his friends to always have the latest music, so they came to his house on a regular basis just to listen to it. That is where Mednas discovered the art of DJing. In 1996, he started DJing for fun and for his friends. Little by little, people started asking him to play at parties. Then, the word spread and clubs started to request him. Mednas ventured to Madrid, Spain at age 20 to pursue his studies, and spent seven years there. He was enrolled at Saint Louis University (Madrid Campus).Mednas was an avid body boarder and almost went pro in the sport. He won many interschool championships, regional championships, and was a quarterfinalist in the Moroccan Championship. He was part of the Moroccan team in 2001, in which he represented Morocco in the ETB (European Tour of Body Boarding) in Portugal along with Adnane Benslimane. Mednas eventually stopped competing due to a triple fracture of his metatarsus while surfing in 2005, in addition to his studies and DJ career. However, he still surfs for fun on occasions.
To complete his degree in international business, Mednas transferred to Saint Louis University Main Campus in St. Louis, Missouri. In 2008, he moved to Miami, Florida to pursue his career in music.
