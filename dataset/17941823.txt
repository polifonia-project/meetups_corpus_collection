== Career ==
Sean Tyas was born in Massapequa Park, New York in 1979.
He began his music career in 2006, after Dutch trance/electro house DJ, Sander van Doorn, selected him as the winner of the "Punk'd" remix contest. Shortly after releasing his debut single and first #1 record "Lift", Mixmag & Beatport named him "Best New DJ" and "One To Watch," marking the beginning of Tyas' journey to becoming one of the most celebrated names in trance music.
Throughout his 10-year career, he racked up a multitude of landmark achievements, including a much-lauded BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix to his credit.
His musical output includes five mix compilations albums and an impressive amount of #1 hits, such as his unforgettable remix of Dash Berlin and Emma Hewitt's "Waiting," and his groundbreaking single "Seven Weeks," which spent an astounding 12 weeks at #1. Tyas is often known for turning a great track into a monster hit of 'titanic' proportions, his remix credits include reworks for early Tiësto, Above & Beyond, Dash Berlin, Lange, Gareth Emery, and a co-production (Intricacy) with Armin van Buuren as well as others.Tyas' 5 recent consecutive high rankings within the highly coveted DJ Mag Top 100 poll are a result of his dynamic DJ performances at some of the largest clubs and festivals in the world, including Tomorrowland, A State Of Trance, Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival, Electric Zoo, Godskitchen, Gatecrasher, Ministry Of Sound, Beyond Wonderland, Avalon Hollywood, Privilege Ibiza, and many more.
In 2013, Tyas released his two singles since 2011, "Lose My Logic" and "Now You See." The latter reached #2 yet dominated the Top 5 of the Beatport trance chart for 6 consecutive weeks.
In 2014, Tyas signed a highly exclusive multi-album deal with a well-known dance music label, Black Hole Recordings. His debut LP was released on Black Hole in 2015.
