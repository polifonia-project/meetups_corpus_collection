Karl Pontus Norgren (born April 22, 1968) is the current guitarist of the Swedish power metal band HammerFall and formerly played guitar for The Poodles.


== Biography ==
Norgren replaced former HammerFall guitarist Stefan Elmgren, who decided to focus on his career as a pilot. Norgren was contacted by Joacim Cans, HammerFall's singer, who asked him if he knew a good guitarist. Being a fan of HammerFall's music and desiring to play a heavier style of music than that of The Poodles, Norgren suggested himself. HammerFall asserts that they are happy with Norgren as a guitarist and band member.
Norgren previously played with bands including Great King Rat, Talisman, Humanimal, The Ring, and Zan Clan.
He also served as live sound engineer for Thin Lizzy during the band's 2000 tour,  similarly serving Europe and Yngwie J. Malmsteen.
Recently, he joined The German Panzer as one of the group's 2nd guitarists.
