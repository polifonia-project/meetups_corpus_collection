Rudy Trouvé (born 28 January 1967 in Wilrijk) is a Belgian musician from Antwerp.
In the early nineties he founded the Heavenhotel record label and released dozens of records since. Between 1993 and 1995 he was part of Deus, quitting the band in favour of focusing on his own solo career, exploring obscure music groups and temporary collaborations.
Since 1995, he scored most success with Kiss My Jazz and Dead Man Ray, and recorded a split album with Lou Barlow on the Sub Rosa label.
Rudy Trouvé is regarded highly as an improvisor; in jam sessions and experimental concerts he has shared the stage with Mauro Pawlowski, Zeitkratzer Ensemble (Germany), Marc Ribot (US), Pierre Bastien, Pierre Berthet, members of DAAU, Zita Swoon, among others.
As a former student at St-Lucas in Ghent, Rudy Trouvé is also famous for his artwork: figurative paintings and blow-ups which can be found on the record sleeves of most of his self-produced records and the bands he performed with.  One of them was Worst Case Scenario by dEUS.
