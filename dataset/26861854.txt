== Career ==
Luke joined Seikima-II in February 1987, replacing guitarist Jail O'Hashi. Like the other members, Luke adopted the stage persona of an Akuma ("demon") from the futuristic hyper-evolved dimension Makai ("demon world"), where he was the former Staff General of Military Authorities. They all wear face paint and elaborate stage outfits. The band preaches a demonic religion called Akumakyō through heavy metal music to conquer the Earth. Luke released nine studio albums with them, and is their most credited songwriter. In accordance to their fictional "prophecy" and after completing their "world conquest", Seikima-II disbanded at the end of the century on December 31, 1999 at 23:59:59. They sold over 10 million records, and have had limited time-reunions in 2005, 2010, and 2015.
While still in Seikima-II, Luke released a solo album in 1991. In 1995 he joined the short-lived supergroup Kings, with Shuichi Aoiki (Night Hawks) on vocals, Taiji Sawada (X, Loudness) on bass and Satoshi "Joe" Miyawaki (44 Magnum, Spread Beaver) on drums. He released the instrumental album A Sight For Sore Eyes in 2001 under the name TOYO (Totally Oval Yellow Outbreak). The following year, Luke formed the rock band Canta with Seikima-II drummer Raiden Yuzawa and Animetal bassist Masaki. After 18 years, Canta disbanded in 2020 after a farewell tour.Since 2007, Luke has supported Toshihiko Takamizawa of The Alfee both in the studio and in live performances. Their group of guitarists is called Ōji Rengō (王子連合) and also includes Anchang (Sex Machineguns) and Koji (La'cryma Christi). Luke contributed to Masatoshi Ono's 2011 album The Voice -Stand Proud!-, playing guitar on covers of Airplay's "Stranded" and "Open Arms" by Journey. In 2016, he provided guitar to the songs "We Are!" from Blizzard of Animetal the Second by Animetal the Second and "Chateau de Sable" from Fate by Mary's Blood.
