== Career ==


=== The Killers (2002-present) ===

Vannucci studied classical percussion at UNLV, while also working as a photographer at Chapel of the Flowers, a wedding chapel on Las Vegas Boulevard. He was performing with a local group, Romance Fantasy, when he met Brandon Flowers and Dave Keuning, who had recently begun performing as the Killers. He joined the Killers in August 2002. The band would practice at Vannucci's garage, and he would also sneak the band into the Alta Ham Fine Arts Building at UNLV at night to practice.

The Killers have released six consecutive No. 1 albums in the United Kingdom, sold over 22 million records worldwide, and have been nominated for seven Grammy Awards and seven BRIT Awards.


=== Big Talk (2011-present) ===
Vannucci recorded a side project album during 2010-2011 and titled it Big Talk, aiming with tongue-in-cheek at the abundance of music being put out by labels before it is being fully prepared.   NME named the eponymous album #24 on its Best Albums of 2011 list.  Big Talk was mixed by Alan Moulder and recorded at Battle Born Studios with Joe Chiccarelli as producer.  Matt Sharp (of Weezer and the Rentals) and long time friend Taylor Milne were enlisted to help record the album.  Little Oil / Epitaph Records released the album on July 12, 2011.  Big Talk was preceded by a single, "Getaways", on May 10, 2011.  Vannucci was listed at #49 on NME's Cool List of 2011.
In 2015, Big Talk released their sophomore album,  Straight In No Kissin'.

== Playing style ==
Vannucci mainly plays with his kit set up using a jazz technique with a high stool and hitched-up snare stand.  He attributes this to his 6 ft 1 frame, a former teacher who whipped him, and the examples of great drummers including Mitch Mitchell and many jazz performers.Vannucci is known for crashing his hi-hats, skillful sixteenth notes, and a fluid playing style.  Drummer Magazine labels them a "few distinctive hallmarks [that] help characterize Ronnie's style".Vannucci and his bandmate, bass guitarist Mark Stoermer, have what they consider a rewarding relationship musically.  Of Stoermer, Vannucci has said, "He almost intuitively knows what I am going to play and his parts are so rhythmic it's a joy to dance around him I really enjoy thinking up parts with him. . . it works very well for us."Vannucci was featured on the cover of Rhythm Magazine in October 2006, (where he was dubbed "pop's dynamic showman") and again in November 2008 and October 2012.  He was also featured on Drummer Magazine in June 2009 and Modern Drummer Magazine in 2013. He was featured in Modern Drummer Magazine in March 2009 and in Drumhead Magazine, September 2008 and again in October 2008.
