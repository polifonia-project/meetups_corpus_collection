In her audition, Bennett first performed the Dixie Chicks' "Cowboy Take Me Away", and was complimented by Paula Abdul on her voice.

Randy Jackson said that she has the lineage (referring to Nesby), Abdul called Bennett incredible, and Simon Cowell asked where she had been hiding. Bennett was given a unanimous vote to go to Hollywood.
In the first Hollywood round, Bennett sang "Can't Fight the Moonlight" and was put through to the next round.

Bennett performed Beyonc√© Knowles' "Work It Out" on the March 28 show, in which the theme was of songs from the past six years. Jackson thought it was the best of the night; Abdul called it awesome. Cowell found it overly precocious.
On April 4, the country theme night, Bennett performed "How Do I Live" by LeAnn Rimes. Kenny Rogers felt that it was a good choice to display Bennett's strengths.  Jackson found the beginning weak, but felt she improved somewhat by the end. Abdul did not feel a connection with the song, and thought it seemed a struggle for Bennett.

The theme of the April 25 show was love songs. Bennett performed Barbra Streisand's "The Way We Were". David Foster called her rehearsal performance "very nice", and Andrea Bocelli called her voice spectacular. Jackson said that he liked it although he was not blown away. Abdul thought Bennett oversang in parts, but overall it was the best female vocal of the night. Cowell called it a very good vocal, but old-fashioned. Bennett was in the bottom two with Kellie Pickler, but was not eliminated.
The first theme on May 2 was songs from the contestants' year of birth. Bennett chose "Kiss" by Prince, although the version released in 1988 was by Art of Noise, featuring Tom Jones. Jackson liked the performance. Abdul stated that she loves Bennett singing songs from the past eras. Cowell found it screechy and annoying. The second theme was songs on the current Billboard charts. Bennett performed "Be Without You" by Mary J. Blige. Jackson thought that Bennett rocked it. Abdul thought that she loved Bennett's voice on the song, but was wishing for an individual flip on it. Cowell thought that Bennett did rather well with the song. On May 3, Bennett was placed in the bottom two with Yamin and eliminated from the competition.
