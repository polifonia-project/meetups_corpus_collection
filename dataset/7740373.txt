== Career ==


=== 1997–2000: Sechs Kies ===

Eun Ji-won and Kang Sung-hoon were discovered by a Daesung Entertainment president, Lee Ho Yeon, who was vacationing in Hawaii. Lee formed a six-member group in which Eun became the leader, main rapper and sub-vocalist.
The group debuted in 1997, and disbanded in 2000. Eun described his time with Sechs Kies as hectic, recalling that members would retreat to their parents' homes to avoid the demanding schedule. They disappeared about two weeks, so they blew off a lot of schedule. Kim Jae-duck said "We were arrogant at that time". Eun Ji-won said the group's record label planned many of their media appearances without consulting the members. On the other hand, he said that it was the way to catch up with the H.O.T.. At the Korean variety show Happy together on March 10, 2011, Eun Ji-won said that Sechs Kies had to maintain a very tight schedule to close the gap on its rival H.O.T.. During this time, the group's popularity rivaled that of H.O.T..
On May 18, 2000 Sechs Kies announced their departure from the K-pop scene at a press conference, where a few members were tearful. Lee Jai-jin later said that the group originally intended to leave their record label without disbanding. Eun Ji-won, on the other hand, said that the members had decided it would be best to disband at the peak of their career. They had an opportunity to talk about the disbandment all together during an interview on October 17, 2016. Eun Ji-won stated that the disbandment was decided upon agreement by a majority of the members, though Lee Jai-jin was one of the members that stood against the disbandment.After the press conference a last music video, "Thanks", was released after their final concert. He said he had not seen bandmate Ko Ji-yong for seven years; Ko moved to the United States to study, and has not returned.Although Sechs Kies disbanded in 2000, in 2002 Eun performed with former member Kang Sung-hun and J-Walk Kim Jae-duck and Jang Su-won. In 2007, he performed with J-Walk on a number of music shows, including KBS' Yoon Do Hyun's Love Letter (where they performed the SechsKies song, "Couple") and Music Bank (performing Eun's "Adios" and J-Walk's "Light Storm").
