She has also recorded with Erato, Virgin Records, Accent, Astreé, and Zig Zag Territories.
In 2014 she started a collaboration with Theresia Youth Baroque Orchestra of which she is permanent conductor together with Claudio Astronio and Alfredo Bernardini.She plays a violin attributed to Nicolò Amati in 1674.
