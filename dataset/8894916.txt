== Career ==
Wolf studied classical piano at the Conservatory of Music in Vienna. At the age of 16, he won the European Jazz Festival as a solo pianist. Twice he won the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis, a German award, for his work with André Heller and Erika Pluhar.
Wolf moved to America in his early twenties. He worked with bassist Neal Starkey and guitarist Bill Hatcher in Atlanta, Georgia, and with drummer Steve Sample Jr. and keyboardist, guitarist, and vocalist Ray Reach in Birmingham, Alabama. After his time in the southeastern United States, Wolf moved to Los Angeles, where he played keyboards for Frank Zappa in the late 1970s. In 1987, he joined Terry Bozzio, Mark Isham, Peter Maunu, and Patrick O'Hearn in the band Group 87. 
Wolf began producing in 1985, co-producing The Commodores "Nightshift". The following year, Wolf produced four hit singles: Starship's "We Built This City" and "Sara", Wang Chung's "Everybody Have Fun Tonight", and El Debarge's "Who's Johnny", leading to more studio and production work.After losing his home and home studio in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Wolf relocated to Austria and founded a new studio, Little America. Wolf composed music for the films Neverending Story III, Weekend at Bernie's II, The Hollywood Sign, and Nutcracker and Mouse King, which won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film. His credits include Irren Ist Männlich (To Err is a Male Thing), Die Cellistin (The Cellist), Widows, St. Pauli Nacht (St. Pauli Night), The Fearless Four and Band on the Run. In 2011 he composed music for the Christmas movie Als der Weihnachtsmann vom Himmel fiel.
In July 2015 Wolf and Lea Wolf-Millesi started Whamslam, an online entertainment platform for kids that combines creativity, music, and education.
