== Biography ==
Nicholas John Cester was born on 6 July 1979 and grew up in Melbourne. He is the oldest of four brothers, born to a Scottish mother and John, his Australian father with Italian parents (Elisa from province of Treviso and Ercole from province of Pordenone). His uncle, Eugene Cester (aka Eugene De La Hot Croix Bun), is a founder of satirical rock band TISM. Cester attended St Bedes Boys College in Mentone, Victoria, and sees The Beatles as his greatest musical influence.
The rock band, Jet, was initially formed in 1996 by Cester and Cameron Muncey while at High School. Cester decided to learn how to play guitar after watching his uncle play "Blackbird". Jet has a line-up of Cester (vocals, guitar), his brother Chris (drums, percussion, vocals), Muncey (lead guitar, vocals), and Mark Wilson (bass, piano, vocals). When Jet first began performing in clubs, Cester was working in a local factory as a forklift operator. Jet played multiple shows and residencies at The Duke of Windsor Hotel in Chapel Street, Windsor. Dave Powell of Majorbox Music saw them play one night and decided to manage the group. The band was signed to the Elektra record label after their debut single, "Take It Or Leave It", became a hit.
Cester is also a founder of the supergroup The Wrights. On 31 October 2007, Cester performed alongside Powderfinger and Missy Higgins in Concert for a Cure (for women with breast cancer). In February 2009, Cester performed at the 50th anniversary celebration of the founding of Melbourne's Myer Music Bowl with a cover version of Paul McCartney's "Maybe I'm Amazed". On 22 January 2010, he covered the AC/DC song "Back in Black" with British rock group Muse at the Big Day Out. On 8 June he sang it with Muse again at San Siro gig, in Milan.
Cester, with Davey Lane and Kram have provided a single, "Tomorrow", for the Australian feature film Tomorrow, When the War Began. Cester appears in Kram's "Silk Suits" music video as a tennis umpire alongside Australian Tennis Player Alicia Molik.In November 2017 he released his first solo album Sugar Rush.

Jet rescheduled several European dates, allowing him time to recover.
