In 2010, she signed a contract with Columbia Records Nashville and released her debut single, "Gettin' Married". The song has charted on Hot Country Songs and has been made into a music video, directed by Trey Fanjoy.Stormy Lewis of Roughstock gave Smith's song a four-star rating, comparing it to the Dixie Chicks and Lorrie Morgan. Jim Malec, writing for American Twang, gave it a thumbs-down, calling Smith's vocal "shrill and thin".
