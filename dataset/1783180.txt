However, Smith was deemed too old and the title role was given to Quvenzhané Wallis in February 2013.On October 6, 2011, "Fireball", a collaboration between Smith and rapper Nicki Minaj, was released.

I wanted to name my musical compilation after it because, while I was making these songs, I was in such a transitional state. Digging deep in the soil of my heart and finding bits and pieces of my ancient self that tell stories, which end up being the lyrics to the songs."On her birthday, October 31, 2017, she released her second album The 1st which is praised for its musical development, particularly Willow's ability to create music following her 1990s R&B predecessors, despite not having been alive during the time.
