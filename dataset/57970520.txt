Mike Nyoni was a Zambian musician who rose from the band Born Free which was founded in 1972 by bandleader, drummer, and vocalist Nicky Mwanza, but the band never recorded until a complete personnel change. Star-in-the-making Mike Nyoni joined as vocalist and lead guitarist. The Band is known for the album Mukaziwa Chingoni.
Nyoni's style of music took a step away from the fuzz-rock sounds of Zamrock, opting to add wah-wah guitar pedals and overall funk elements.He won Zambia's best solo artist in 1984 Zambia Daily Mail polls.
