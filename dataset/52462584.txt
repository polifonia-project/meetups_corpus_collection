After moving to New York, Bergman started out as a member of her brother Elliot's band Nomo, adding vocals to the 2011 Nomo and Shawn Lee single "Upside Down". She was fired from Nomo, but then she and Elliot formed the psychedelic pop duo Wild Belle. Wild Belle has released three albums: Isles (2013), Dreamland (2016), and Everybody One of a Kind (2019).In 2019, Bergman's father and stepmother were killed by a drunk driver in a car accident. Bergman then spent a week in a silent retreat at a monastery in Chama Valley in New Mexico. The resulting gospel-folk album, Mercy, is a reflection on the tragedy, and on Bergman's own spirituality. Her debut solo album, it was recorded in Los Angeles at her brother Elliot's home studio. In July 2021, she released two tracks with Beck: a cover of Lion's 1975 soul single "You've Got a Woman" and Beck's remix of "Paint the Rain" from Mercy.On September 30, 2021, she released the EP Live at Electric Lady on Spotify, part of a series of live performances at Electric Lady Studios.
