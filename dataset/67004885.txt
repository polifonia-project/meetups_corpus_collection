== Early life ==
Shaylee Curnow was born on 2 April 1997 in Australia. PRC grew up in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. She chose her stage name due to her love of the colour pink, as a homage to Princess Peach, using the title during her time performing as a stripper. An abbreviation for porcelain, she began using the suffix PRC on TikTok because to type out the full word would be too long a name.In an interview with Echo Magazine, Curnow said: "I've been interested in music for as long as I could talk, really. I've always sang and wrote songs and even have songs written from when I was like 8 years old."In her early career, Curnow acted in music videos, most notably appearing as the love interest in Ambleside's music video for "Wash Away" in 2016.

=== 2019–2020: "Blondes" and TikTok popularity ===
On 19 June 2019, Curnow independently released her debut single "Blondes". She created a TikTok account in September 2019, subsequently attracting an audience after posting content about her life, self-care advice, and her music. Her second single "Colourblind" was released on 2 May 2020. She said that the inspiration for the song "came from [her] synaesthesia and mine happens to be with colours and music; so I wanted to write a song that involved the colours I saw when singing it."


=== 2021–present: "Josh" and Republic Records signing ===
On 21 February 2021, The Music Network confirmed Curnow had signed with Island Records in Australia and Republic Records in the US. Her debut major label single "Josh" was released on 26 February 2021. Discussing the song, she said: "It's very special to me, because it captured a real moment. I was a bit down when I was writing one day. My ex, Josh, kept calling me over and over again. He called all of the time, because he was trying to get back with me. I thought I had blocked him though. Since he didn't stop bothering me, I wrote the song about him. It's a true story, but it's meant to be fun and colourful." The song debuted at number 38 on the ARIA Singles Chart. On 25 June, Curnow released the single "Symptomatic". On 22 October, Curnow released the two-track single "I've Been Bad, Santa" / "Christmas Kinda Sucks". On 5 November, Curnow released the single "Heavy".

Curnow came out as a lesbian on 13 January 2022. She had previously identified as bisexual. On 9 February 2021, she featured on Abbie Chatfield's It's a Lot podcast, where she discussed coming to terms with her sexuality, stating; "every gay person I knew, or bi person, was like 'yeah I always knew. I've known it since I was little.' I don't remember knowing from a young age that I liked girls."


=== Relationship with Alex Williamson ===
On 28 April 2021, Curnow made a post on social media, alleging abusive and predatory behaviour by her former boyfriend, Australian comedian Alex "Shooter" Williamson. Williamson responded in a series of stories on Instagram, claiming the allegations were "horse shit" and accusing PRC of domestic violence, recounting an incident in which she allegedly tried to kick down a door while he was on the toilet. Williamson was subsequently dropped by his management a day later, and the lineup of the Perth and Sydney comedy festivals on 3 May. Williamson has rebuked all claims. Following the allegations against him, Instagram removed Williamson's profile. Williamson claimed this was the second time Curnow had attempted to "deplatform" him, after which she removed the posts.
