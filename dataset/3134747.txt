After Another Level split in 2000, Bowers wrote and fronted two UK Singles Chart top ten singles for the UK garage act True Steppers in 2000, where he was billed as "Dane Bowers from Another Level". "Buggin" entered the charts at No. 6 in April 2000, and "Out of Your Mind", featuring the first solo recording of Spice Girl, Victoria Beckham, which reached No. 2, as it was beaten to the number one spot by "Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)" in August 2000 by Spiller featuring Sophie Ellis-Bextor.

The song peaked at No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart. Jerry 'Wonder' Duplessis and Wyclef Jean-produced "Another Lover" was released as the album's second single in June 2001, but this again stalled at number nine.
