Leonhart returned to New York and in 1994 began singing in jazz clubs.
That year she competed in the Thelonious Monk International Vocal Jazz Competition, coming third.
A critic said her choice of the songs "Nobody Else but Me" and "Day Dream" was daring, but she needed greater control and more focused delivery.
In the following years Leonhart performed with a variety of musicians including The Real Live Show, a hip-hop group, and Wax Poetic.
The Wax Poetic project combines electronica, trip hop, funk, and jazz.
In 1998 she recorded an album with the Swiss Percussion Ensemble, a group of four classical percussionists whose instruments were mainly made of glass.
In 2000, Leonhart released the album Steal The Moon, a collaborative project with pianist and composer Rob Bargad.
Since then she began performing regularly with her own group at the Smoke Jazz Club in New York City, at Steamers and The Vic in California, and at other clubs on the east coast.Leonhart and other members of the Swiss Percussion Ensemble formed Lyn Leon, a pop/lounge group that made several successful tours of Europe and released the album Glass Lounge in Germany in 2004.
Lyn Leon toured with the jazz singer Al Jarreau during the fall of 2004.
Leonhart said "Improvising with Al Jarreau was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. It opened me up to another level of creative awareness and expression".
Between 2000 and 2007 Leonhart was a lead back-up vocalist with Steely Dan, singing on three world tours and two albums.
She performed again with Steely Dan in 2009 and 2011. She and the group's other female backing vocalists, Cindy Mizelle and La Tanya Hall, are usually spotlighted singing lead on the song "Dirty Work".

They married in Manhattan on 17 January 2004. As of 2020, they are no longer married.Leonhart studied Contemporary Commercial Music Vocal Pedagogy Institute at Shenandoah University.

She was deeply influenced by her father and by Donald Fagen and Walter Becker of Steely Dan.
