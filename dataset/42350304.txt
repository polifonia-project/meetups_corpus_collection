On the band's debut album, Doug Moore of Invisible Oranges wrote: "Sacred White Noise is both artsy and rooted in black metal, it’s pristinely performed, beautifully recorded, and far more expansive than any typical black metal album." He also described it as "a thematically and harmonically frightening" record, while stating: "Progressive rock and outré noise run flanking maneuvers around the edges of a truly vicious frontal assault that borders on death metal in gravity."
