Keavy was born to Brendan and Noeleen Lynch, a mechanic and housewife, respectively, and raised in Donaghmede, North-east Dublin. Keavy is one of six children and her brother Shane is also a member of boy band Boyzone.
Before B*Witched, Keavy worked as a part-time trainee car mechanic at her father's garage.In an interview, Edele talked about her bond with her twin: "She's the greatest gift I've ever been given, and I think a lot of identical twins would say that. She really is my other half, and I'm not the same without her. We've worked together most of our lives and when we looked back on when B*Witched split and we went our separate ways for the first time, that was like our first day at school. I missed her."


== Music career ==
In 1997, Keavy and Edele formed the girl group Butterfly Farm with their friend Sinéad O'Carroll. They began writing and recording together, but soon realised that there was "someone missing". Upon Keavy's suggestion, they asked Lindsay Armaou to audition and she played a tape recording of a song she had written. The other girls liked it and Lindsay became the fourth member of the band, who later changed their name to B*Witched.
After B*Witched split in 2002, Keavy remained somewhat active in the music industry, forming Ziiiing!, a production and songwriting company, with musical partner Alex Toms. In 2011, she and Edele formed a new group, Barbarellas.
