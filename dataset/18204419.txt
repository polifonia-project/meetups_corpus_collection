Miret was born in Havana, Cuba. He is the older half-brother of Madball frontman Freddy Cricien. The two have the same mother, who is of Cuban descent, and different fathers, hence the different last names. Miret and his family fled Cuba to escape the Castro regime. They came to the United States in 1968 and settled in New York.Miret was incarcerated on a drug charge in the late 1980s, spending almost two years in jail. In a 2011 interview, he stated that he became involved in it because he was living in poverty, squatting buildings, and his then-partner was pregnant.
