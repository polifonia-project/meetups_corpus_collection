He is also a label manager and concert organizer who produces his own projects and experimental artists who predominantly originate from Asia and Africa on the labels Syrphe and Textolux.C-drík is a noted researcher on the history of experimental and extreme music in Africa and in Asia. He has written essays and given many conferences on the topic. In 2016, with sociologist and experimental musician Dimitri della Faille, he co-wrote a book on noise music in Southeast Asia.

Aliases such as D-Drik, F-Drik, H-drík, J-drík, Kirdec, O-drik, Q-drík, R-Drik, V-drík, Y-drík are therefore variations of C-drík main alias.
