== Biography ==
Harold Vick was born on April 3, 1936 in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.  At the age of 13 he was given a clarinet by his uncle, Prince Robinson, a clarinet and tenor saxophone player who had been a member of McKinney's Cotton Pickers. Three years later he took up the tenor saxophone, and soon began playing in R&B bands. He continued to perform, still largely with R&B bands, while studying psychology at Howard University.


== Recordings as leader ==
Steppin' Out!, Vick's first album as leader, was recorded for Blue Note in 1963.  After a 1965 performance at Carnegie Hall with Donald Byrd, Vick secured a contract for further albums as leader, and from 1966 to 1974 he had further recording sessions for the RCA, Muse, and Strata-East labels.

At the same time he continued to work as a freelance jazz musician and session musician.  As late as 1987 he performed on two Billie Holiday tribute albums by Abbey Lincoln.He also played with Nat Adderley, Mercer Ellington, Sarah Vaughan, Billy Taylor, Horace Silver, and Gene Ammons.
