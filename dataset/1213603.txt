Author Ian Christe describes his vocals as "operatic."


== Biography ==

His music career began in 1985 with the Hungarian metal band Tormentor, which reached cult status in black metal circles with their first album, Anno Domini (1988). Tormentor performed 50-100 live shows between 1986–1990 and became one of the most infamous bands in Hungary. After Tormentor he started his dark electro industrial band Plasma Pool (1990–1994). On the strength of his work in Tormentor, he was invited to perform vocals on the De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas album by Norwegian black metal band Mayhem after lead singer Dead committed suicide. His groundbreaking new way of singing added a special character to Mayhem's sound. Ultimately Csihar did not perform any live concerts with the band until his second tenure in 2004.

After Mayhem, Csihar continued to work in various bands, such as  Plasma Pool, Aborym, and Korog; he also performed as Caiaphas in the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar in Hungary. He stated during an interview for Hungarian Metal Hammer that he felt honoured to sing "This Jesus Must Die". He performed in Keep of Kalessin as well on their returning EP Reclaim together with drummer Frost from Satyricon.
He is a "shadow" member of the American doom/drone metal band Sunn O))). His first live performance with the band happened on 24 March 2003 at Stadtwerkstatt in Linz, Austria. His first recorded collaboration with the band was in 2004 when he sang in Sanskrit language on the tracks "Decay2 [Nihil's Maw]" and "Decay (The Symptoms of Kali Yuga)" on their album White2. He has recorded five full-length albums with the group, including the very successful Monoliths & Dimensions, and performed live with the band on their worldwide tours hundreds of shows.
In 2004, Csihar rejoined Mayhem after the departure of Maniac, the band's previous vocalist. Their 2007 album, Ordo ad Chao, won the Spellemannprisen (also known as the Norwegian Grammy). Since then the band has embarked upon intense international touring.
In 2008 he also joined another project, Gravetemple with Stephen O'Malley of Sunn O))) and Oren Ambarchi.
Csihar started his solo act in November 2008, called Void ov Voices. His live performances have been in support of artists like Ulver on their first European tour, Bohren & der Club of Gore, Lustmord, Ruin and Diamanda Galas. He performed at "The Grand Reincarnation" Of Paul Booth's Last Rites Gallery & Tattoo Theatre. He also toured in Japan and performed during the Mofo festival in Tasmania.
He has collaborated with artists such as Current 93, Jarboe, Dissection, Emperor, Taake, Ulver, and Banks Violette.
Between 2016 and 2018, Csihar joined blackened death metal supergroup Sinsaenum. He would perform lead vocals alongside Sean Zatorsky of Dååth, with DragonForce bassist and group founder Frédéric Leclercq and Loudblast guitarist Stéphane Buriez on guitars, Seth guitarist Heimoth on bass, and former Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison on drums. The band released its debut album Echoes of the Tortured on 29 July 2016 via earMUSIC.
In 2019 he formed an esoteric noise project called Hiedelem with drummer/percussionist Balázs Pándi (Merzbow, Keiji Haino).
Outside of music, Csihar graduated as an electrical engineer from a technical college, and used to be a private teacher of math and physics.He worked in film production, most notably on Tony Scott's Spy Game, where he was the first assistant of production designer Norris Spencer. In 2018 he was portrayed in the film Lords of Chaos, which depicted the early 90s Norwegian black metal scene (in particular Mayhem). He was portrayed by his son Arion.
Although Mayhem have often displayed dead animals and blood at their live events, Csihar is a vegetarian in his personal life.
