His music recording career started in 2010, with the extended play, Origins, that was independently released.  He would release two more extended plays independently, Swallowing Death, Breathing Life in 2012, and Anchor in 2013, where Matt Conner in a four star review wrote, "It's astounding that a label hasn't swept up the bright young star in the worship universe known as John Tibbs." Upon demand, Tibbs began to tour his music full-time in 2013. In addition to touring consistently, he amassed an online community of more than 100,000 fans who helped crowd-fund two breakout independent recordings which earned national notoriety on NoiseTrade. This influence led him to tour independently with Audrey Assad, and open for acts like Gungor and Tenth Avenue North. Tibbs would go on to sign with Fair Trade Services, where they are releasing, Dead Man Walking, on October 30, 2015. Earlier this year, audiences across the country were introduced to Tibbs' compelling live performance as a special guest on Newsboys' "We Believe...God's Not Dead" Spring Tour. His single, "Dead Man Walking", featuring Ellie Holcomb, has broken through on the Billboard magazine Christian Airplay chart, becoming a Top 20 AC song at Christian radio.
