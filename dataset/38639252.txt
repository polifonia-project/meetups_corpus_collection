Hanna Elise Isabell Maj Höstblomma Ryd (born 15 October 1984), known professionally as Elize Ryd, is a Swedish singer, songwriter, dancer, composer, and show artist, best known as one of the three vocalists and co-lyricist in the melodic metalcore/power metal/melodic death metal band Amaranthe. She also gained some popularity prior to the band's inception by performing guest vocals for the symphonic power metal band Kamelot, both on tour and in the studio. She sings in the soprano range.


== Early life ==
Hanna Elise Isabell Maj Höstblomma Ryd was born in Värnamo on 15 October 1984, the daughter of a Swedish father and a Finnish mother, both of whom were musicians. She performed in public for the first time when she was four years old. During her childhood, she was influenced by everything from Walt Disney to heavy metal. At the age of 13, she attended and won a 1998 talent show in Gothenburg as the youngest participant. The first prize was a record deal, but since she did not meet the minimum of age of 15, she was ineligible to receive the prize. She received a scholarship for the most promising singer and a spot in a musical called Brödupploppet that was played 76 times at Exercishuset in Gothenburg. She received another scholarship award in 2003, when she graduated from high school

=== Early career ===
After graduating from a three-year education at a performing arts school, Ryd started her professional singing career as a cabaret performer at the Cabaret Lorensberg in Gothenburg. She also did songs for various local bands such as Falconer. When she met Joacim "Jake E" Lundberg in a club in Gothenburg, he requested that she record vocals for a song with his band Dreamland, titled "Fade Away". Lundberg later introduced her to Olof Mörck, who proposed a collaboration with his band Dragonland, to which she agreed. It was around this time that symphonic metal band Nightwish took interest in Ryd as a replacement for their previous singer Tarja Turunen, although she was ultimately not chosen for the role. At the same time, she, Mörck, and Lundberg talked about starting their own band with her as a lead singer and composer. The band was named Avalanche, which was later renamed to Amaranthe for legal reasons.
