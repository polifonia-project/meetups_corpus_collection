Prior to the group's debut, Zonnique Jailee Pullins (daughter of Tameka "Tiny" Harris then Cottle)  was a member of the duo group QT Posse with QT Jazz. QT Posse later disbanded and OMG Girlz was formed. This new group consisted of four members Zonnique "Star" Pullins, sisters Bahja "Beauty" and Lourdes "Lolo" Rodriguez, and Reginae "Baby" Carter whose parents were all close friends with Zonnique's mother.Shortly after the release of their first single "Ain't Nobody" in 2010, Reginae "Baby Carter" Carter (daughter of rapper Lil Wayne and Toya Carter) departed from the group. A few months later, OMG Girlz's second single "Haterz" (stylized as H.A.T.E.R.Z) was released. OMG later performed the single on Good Day Atlanta. The group downsized once more after Lourdes "Lolo" Rodriguez left the group given her young age. Afterwards this left the group as a duo consisting of members "Beauty" and "Star" only.
While searching for a third member, the fourth single "So Official" was released. Shortly after OMG had pinned the newest addition to the group Breaunna "Babydoll" Womack due to finding her on a YouTube video dancing to Beyoncé's song "Ego".
