Phil 'Ron' Moody is a former member of British anarcho-punk band Chumbawamba. He joined the group in 2007 as the accordionist. He has, since, however, played a number of instruments. Jude Abbott has described Moody as "Doing all the little funny bits", such as comedy one-liners and re-enacting certain samples (in "Ratata-tay" for instance, he actually recites the poem during live performances). He also contributes to the vocal harmonies and contributes percussion. Soon after joining Chumbawamba, he played at the Glastonbury Festival with the band. In 2008, Chumbawamba released an album called  The Boy Bands Have Won. The album features the Oysterband, Roy Bailey and Barry Coope amongst others.
In the autumn of 2009 he toured northern England in their self-penned pantomime, a comedy musical entitled Riot, Rebellion & Bloody Insurrection with the Red Ladder Theater Company. In late February 2010 he released his second album with Chumbawamba, titled ABCDEFG.
