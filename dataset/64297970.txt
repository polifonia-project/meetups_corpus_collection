=== Early life and career ===
Fujita was born on March 20, 1947 in Chiba, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. As a child, he loved playing football, but spent most of his days alone because his mother died and his father remarried. He attended Chiba Prefectural Chiba High School where he heard a Beatles record, and bought an electric guitar. He was scouted by Watanabe Productions and debuted in 1967 as a member of Out Cast. He served as the guitarist after the previous guitarist, Shuichi Katagiri, left the band shortly before the band's debut. He left in the summer of 1967 after writing three songs, and would form The Love with Yuji Takamiya, Arai Hideo, Yasufumi Tajima (known as "Fumio Shimada" and "Heckel Tajima"), and Hiroshi Kobata. The band dissolved in 1969.


=== Production career ===
In 1980, he scouted Kiyotaka Sugiyama, Shinji Takashima, and Toshitsugu Nishihara from the band Kyutipanchosu. In 1983, Kiyotaka Sugiyama & Omega Tribe debuted with "Summer Suspicion", which peaked at No. 9 on the Oricon charts. He produced all albums by the band. After the band broke up, he scouted Carlos Toshiki, making him the lead vocalist of 1986 Omega Tribe before the name changed to Carlos Toshiki & Omega Tribe. Fujita produced all albums for both variations.
In 1979, Fujita listened to Toshiki Kadomatsu's demo tape. In 1980, Lazy keyboardist Shunji Inoue and the choir group Trois formed the unit "BIG BANG." In March 1981, he produced their cover of Ai No Corrida, establishing Bermuda Music Publishing in the same year. In 1982, he produced Kadomatsu's album, Weekend Fly to the Sun, and in 1984, produced and wrote for Momoko Kikuchi's debut album, Ocean Side.
Many of the songs and albums Fujita produced were hits and succeeded commercially. They were known as the "Triangle Sound".
