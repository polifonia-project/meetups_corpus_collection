Laraaji (born Edward Larry Gordon, 3rd May 1943) is an American multi-instrumentalist specializing in piano, zither and mbira. His albums include  the 1980 release Ambient 3: Day of Radiance, produced by Brian Eno as part of his Ambient series.


== Early life and career ==
Born Edward Larry Gordon in Philadelphia, he studied violin, piano, trombone and voice in his early years in New Jersey.  He attended Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C., where he studied composition and piano.  After studying at Howard, he spent time in New York City pursuing a career as a stand-up comedian and actor, as well as playing Fender Rhodes electric piano in a jazz-rock band ‘Winds of Change’.In the early 1970s, he began to study Eastern mysticism and believed he'd found a new path for his music and his life.  It was also at this time he bought his first zither from a local pawn shop.  Converting it to an electronic instrument, he began to experiment using the instrument like a piano.  By 1978, he developed enough skill to begin busking in the parks and on the sidewalks of New York. He favored the northeast corner of Washington Square Park, where he would improvise for hours on end with his eyes closed.The following year he was encountered by Brian Eno while playing in Washington Square Park, who went on to produce his most widely recognized release, Ambient 3: Day of Radiance, the third installment of Brian Eno's Ambient series.  This was his first album released under the name of Laraaji.
This international exposure led to requests for longer versions of his compositions which he supplied to meditation groups on cassette tapes.  It also resulted in an expansion of his mystic studies with such gurus as Swami Satchidananda and Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati, founder of the Ananda Ashram in Monroe, New York.Laraaji also started the Laughter Meditation Workshops, which he still presents around the globe.
