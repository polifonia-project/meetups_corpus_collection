Gutt has appeared in two seasons of the American reality television series The X Factor. He first appeared in season 2 (2012) when he drew international acclaim for his heartfelt rendition of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah", before being eliminated in the following "Boot Camp" episode. Gutt competed in Season 3 (2013) of The X Factor USA, finishing in second place. In 2014, he was dubbed as one of the most "influential" X Factor USA contestants of all time by FoxWeekly.


== Early life and career ==
Gutt's family resided in St. Clair County, located in southeast Michigan, throughout most of his childhood years. He attended schools in both Algonac and Marine City, graduating from Marine City High School in 1994.
Gutt's prominent band during his high school years was Innerfaith. He was the frontman of Innerfaith, which he formed with friends Matt Brooks on bass, Jeff Sankuer on drums, and guitarist Patrick Sankuer. Innerfaith wrote and performed original songs, ultimately winning the "Blue Water Area Battle of the Bands" in Marysville, Michigan.
In 2012, two early extended plays featuring Gutt on vocals were made downloadable for free through his official site: a three-track 1992–1995 compilation (named Nautical Star by fans for its cover) and a four-track Dragonfly (1997). The latter was recorded by Gutt with the band of the same name which featured Steve Mazur of Our Lady Peace on guitar. Lyrics from the Dragonfly song "Sugarpill" were later used for a Dry Cell song "New Revolution".

Gutt became the lead vocalist for Dry Cell by joining the rock band Beyond Control which consisted of members Danny Hartwell, Judd Gruenbaum, and Brandon Brown. The band released a studio album titled Disconnected in 2002. Gutt left the band in 2004 and Dave Wasierski replaced him as lead vocalist. Gutt rejoined Dry Cell in 2005.
The band went on a brief hiatus from 2005 to 2007, but in 2008 reunited with same members. In 2009 Gutt left Dry Cell for good.In early 2010 a compilation The Dry Cell Collection was released. It contains previously released demos from 2003, 2005 and 2008, B-sides from Disconnected and one previously unreleased song, "So Alive". The band had no news on their MySpace page since 2010. In 2012, it was said on Gutt's official website that Dry Cell is now defunct.

After parting ways with Dry Cell in 2004, Gutt recorded eight demo songs with a band named Acrylic.In 2005 (when Dry Cell went on hiatus), Gutt and his friend, guitarist Gary Pittel, formed Band with No Name (abbreviated as BWNN). The band also included Aaron Hutchinson (drums), Justin "Antic" Hackman (keyboards), Mike Guy and later Ben Lula (bass). In 2007, BWNN released a five-track self-titled EP. In 2008, they won 89X & TNTs Battle of the Bands in Michigan and received $10,000 and studio time to record a new EP. Seven new songs were recorded, and a full-length album named Humanity was released in 2009.

== Stone Temple Pilots ==

On November 16, 2016, Entertainment Tonight reported that Stone Temple Pilots had recruited Gutt to be their new lead singer, replacing Chester Bennington, who had left the band one year earlier. The following day, however, a representative for the band denied this rumor, saying that "the band has been rehearsing with several singers over the past few weeks" and "they haven't made a decision yet." Almost a year later, on November 14, 2017, Stone Temple Pilots officially announced Gutt as their new lead singer, and played their first concert with him that same night at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. Gutt's first single with the band is "Meadow". Founding member Dean DeLeo said: "We wanted someone who would not only do our earlier songs justice, but would also write new songs and carve out a different path forward with us. It took some time, but we found our guy."
