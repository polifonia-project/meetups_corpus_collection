Born near the disaster stricken ruins of Chernobyl, KORR-A was brought to the United States at the age of three to inquire about health complications she suffered as a result of the plant explosion. It was as a child in the U.S. where she began to fall in love with 90's hip-hop and pop hits and the dance moves of icons like Michael and Janet Jackson. She relocated back to Ukraine to reunite with her parents again at the age of 11 where she began dance and singing lessons. Finally, she returned to the U.S. to attend Pepperdine University and launching her music career.
