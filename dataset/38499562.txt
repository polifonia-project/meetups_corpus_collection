== Biography ==


=== Classical music (1977-1999) ===
From 1977 to 1981, Docker performed as a second violinist in the orchestra of the Istituto Musicale Corelli of Pinerolo. From 1978 to 1988 he competed as a pianist in about a dozen international classical piano competitions (Senigallia, Stresa, Bardolino, Torre Pellice, Capri), receiving two first prizes. He also performed in recitals as a classical pianist throughout the 1980s.In September 1989, he obtained a BA in Classical Piano at the Conservatory of Cuneo. He was then hired to play piano and organ on the album Ave Maria by Italian tenor Antonio Caffaro.In June 1996, Docker briefly returned to classical music with a recital called "Paesaggi Esotici", performed at the Turin Museum of Natural History. Featuring Mio Nakamura on vocals, the program included operatic arias and traditional songs linked by the common theme of "the exotic" (particularly Asia).In November 1999, he performed Allegro de Concierto by Enrique Granados at the SFI-Västertorp in Stockholm for its yearly Kulturdagen (Culture Day).


=== Docker's Guild (2008–present) ===
Docker returned to Italy in January 2008. In 2011 he published an article cataloging the Waldensian musical heritage.In 2008, Docker began a project named "Docker's Guild". Its album The Mystic Technocracy – Season 1: The Age of Ignorance was released in 2012 on Lion Music, described by the artist's record label as a progressive rock space opera. Performers on the album included Tony Franklin, Guthrie Govan, Jeff Watson, Greg Bissonette, Goran Edman, John Payne, Tony Mills, and Amanda Somerville. In 2016 Docker released a crowdfunded sequel entitled The Heisenberg Diaries – Book A: Sounds of Future Past. Aside from Docker, all special guests appearing on the album were women from the rock and metal world.
A Season 2 – "The Age of Entropy" – was planned but has no firm release date. Docker stated that: "Season 2 is in the works, but the format will change. The age of rock operas has passed and it's time to focus on the music rather than on the names." Despite this, he has confirmed that Anna Portalupi (Hardline) will be playing bass on the album and that drumming duties will be handled by Elisa "Helly" Montin (The Anunnaki, Cattivator Of Death, Übermensch).  In 2020, Docker released a track from Season 2 "Die Today" as a pre-production demo on the project's blog.In September 2019, Docker organized and headlined the Tony Mills Festival.  The festival was intended to honor his recently deceased collaborator Tony Mills, as well as raising funds for the Mills family and cancer research.  The show marked the first live appearance of Docker's Guild in four years.In December 2019, Docker announced that The Docker's Guild would be performing a rare live performance at Entropy Fest IV in Pinerolo, Italy. However, Docker later cancelled the entire festival, for several reasons including inter alia "the chronic absence of public at the evenings despite the constant online and printed promotion".
