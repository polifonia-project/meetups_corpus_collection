Jack "Bones" O'Brien (né John Roger O'Brien; 16 October 1903 – 12 October 1982) was an American jazz pianist and songwriter from Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Notably, O'Brien was pianist, composer, and arranger with the Ted Weems orchestra from 1925 through 1941.


== Growing up ==
John Roger O'Brien was born October 16, 1903, in Lehighton, Pennsylvania, to the marriage of Charles William O'Brien (1879–1960) and Anna Lena Fetherolf (1878–1967). He was raised in nearby Allentown. In 1921, O'Brien graduated from Bethlehem Preparatory School in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  He went on to Muhlenberg College, where he was in a fraternity, and then to Columbia University, where he studied organ with David McK. Williams (né David McKinley Williams; 1887–1978).


== Career ==
From 1925 to 1941, O'Brien was pianist and arranger with Ted Weems. He began songwriting, exclusively, in 1941.  Before playing piano with Ted Weems, O'Brien got an early start with Art Mickley (né Arthur Hazard Mickley; 1900–1978) and His Orchestra, when he was dubbed "Bones." He then was pianist for several years with the Mason-Dixon Orchestra.  He then started his own orchestra. Then played piano with Ted Weems for about 15 years. His song, "Remember Me," was once the theme song of Morton Downey.
In 1941, O'Brien co-composed (with Moe Jaffe, and Bert Lee, pseudonym of Bert Lown) "Thumbs Up!" (aka "British Delivers the Goods"), which became the official theme song of the British War Relief Society. The song went on to become the theme and movie title for the 1943 film, Thumbs Up.


=== ASCAP boycott ===
"My Greatest Mistake" was a hit in 1940 and was one of some 1,250,000 songs under an ASCAP license. In 1940, ASCAP attempted to double its fees to broadcasters for the airing of licensed songs.  For ten months – January 1, 1941, to October 29, 1941 – radio broadcasters, namely NBC and CBS, banned all music licensed by ASCAP. Given the timing of the launch of "My Greatest Mistake," the ASCAP boycott, according to O'Brien, stunted the momentum of the song's popularity.
