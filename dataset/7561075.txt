== Biography ==
Born in El Dorado, Kansas, Marshall was one of Capitol Records' top producers in the late 1950s and 1960s. He had a varied career as a jazz, rock and classical guitarist and also as a composer, arranger and record producer. He released two solo albums with drummer Shelly Manne that featured his fingerstyle jazz guitar playing. He was a friend of Howard Roberts and Jack Sheldon and produced several of their albums for Capitol. He wrote his own arrangements, many with a big-band sound to them. He was credited with the arrangement for Peggy Lee's "Fever", with Joe Mondragon on bass, Shelly Manne on drums, and Howard Roberts adding the iconic finger snaps. Although it is believed that Lee herself was also responsible for that arrangement, Marshall conducted and arranged all the tunes recorded on the sessions.Marshall composed the theme and incidental music for the 1960s TV series The Munsters and the 1966 tie-in film Munster, Go Home! (the theme music was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1965). He also composed music for the movies The Missouri Traveler (1958), Thunder Road (1958), The Giant Gila Monster (1959) and Kona Coast (1968), as well as The Deputy, a 1959–1961 western television series starring Henry Fonda, and the television series The Investigators (1961), Don't Call Me Charlie! (1962–1963), and The Debbie Reynolds Show (1969–1970).
