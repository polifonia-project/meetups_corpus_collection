Heddy Lester (born Heddy Affolter, 18 June 1950) is a Dutch singer and actress, best known outside the Netherlands for her participation in the 1977 Eurovision Song Contest.


== Early career ==
Lester was born in Amsterdam. Her professional career started with Gert Balke as the duo April Shower, who had a minor hit with "Railroad Song" in 1971. Her father ran a restaurant in Amsterdam, where she met singer Ramses Shaffy, with whom she started touring.  Lester launched her solo career in 1974.


== Eurovision Song Contest ==
In 1977, Lester's song "De mallemolen" ("The Merry-Go-Round"), with music written by her brother Frank, was chosen by a celebrity panel as the winner in the Dutch Eurovision selection. Lester went forward to take part in the 22nd Eurovision Song Contest, held in London on 7 May.  Although "De mallemolen" had been considered a strong contender prior to the contest, it could only manage a disappointing 12th-place finish of 18 entries.


== Later career ==
Since her Eurovision appearance, Lester has worked steadily in a variety of both musical and dramatic stage roles, including works by Lorca (Blood wedding), Euripides (The Trojan Women) and Joshua Sobol (Ghetto).In 2009, Lester, along with several other former Dutch Eurovision contestants, was a special guest on that year's Eurovision selection television programme.
