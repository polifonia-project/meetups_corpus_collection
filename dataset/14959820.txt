Nino Tempo & April Stevens (Antonino and Carol Vincinette LoTempio) are a brother and sister singing act from Niagara Falls, New York. Formed in the early 1960s when Nino Tempo and April Stevens signed as a duo with Atco Records, they had a string of Billboard hits and earned a Grammy Award as "best rock & roll record of the year" for the single "Deep Purple".


== "Deep Purple" ==
"Deep Purple" is notable for April Stevens speaking the lyrics in a low, sweet voice during the second half of the song while her brother sings. When the duo first recorded the song as a demo, Tempo forgot the words, and Stevens spoke the lyrics to remind him.  The producers thought Stevens' spoken interlude was "cute" and should be included on the finished product, but according to Stevens, her brother was not as easily convinced; "He didn't want anyone talking while he was singing!" The duo would employ this tactic again on "Whispering."
Producer Ahmet Erteg√ºn had originally intended "Deep Purple" to be the B-side of a song called "I've Been Carrying A Torch For You So Long That It Burned A Great Big Hole In My Heart"; he was dubious of Tempo's belief that it would be a hit, calling it "the most embarrassing thing" the duo had ever recorded.  When radio stations preferred "Deep Purple," Ertegun relented, and so "I've Been Carrying A Torch ..." was the longest title of a flipside of a Billboard number one record, until Prince's "When Doves Cry" in 1984 had "17 Days ..." on its flipside.
Despite being considered "rock and roll," "Deep Purple" also reached number one on Billboard's Adult Contemporary singles chart.
The record was followed by a series of singles of more oldies in a similar style: "Whispering", "Stardust",  "Tea for Two".


== Later career ==
Music journalist Richie Unterberger has described the later disc All Strung Out as Nino Tempo & April Stevens' "greatest triumph", declaring it "one of the greatest Phil Spector-inspired productions of all time". For years following their charting singles, the duo continued recording, but failed to achieve continued sales success.
However, in March 1973 the duo scored a number 5 hit in the Netherlands with "Love Story" on A&M Records, two years after Andy Williams took that same song to number 13 in the Dutch Top 40.
