Georg "Jojje" Wadenius (born 4 May 1945) is a Swedish multi-instrumentalist, singer, and composer who was particularly active during the 1970s and 1980s as a studio and session guitarist and bassist, as well as for a series of albums of children's songs in Sweden.


== Biography ==
Wadenius was born in Stockholm, Sweden, where he attended Adolf Fredrik's Music School. After appearing on a number of Swedish hit records and being founder-member of two Swedish supergroups of the early 1970s, Made in Sweden (1966–1972 and 1976) and Solar Plexus (1971–1972), he relocated to the United States to become lead guitarist of the US group Blood, Sweat & Tears from 1972 to 1975. In 1979, he joined The Saturday Night Live Band on television. He stayed on until 1985 and has since worked for many important artists as a session player and/or touring musician, among them Steely Dan, Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Dr. John, David Sanborn, James Brown, Marianne Faithfull, Kent, Paul Simon, Joe Thomas, Dionne Warwick, Roberta Flack, Donald Fagen, Doug Katsaros, Michael Franks, and Luther Vandross, as well as many important artists in Sweden.
In 1970, he received a Swedish Grammis for Made in Sweden and another for his work on children's songs.
Later in his career, he produced other Scandinavian performers, including Anne Sofie von Otter, and in 2001 he set up a recording studio in Oslo, Norway.
