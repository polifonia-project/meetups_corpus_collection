== Biography ==
Born in Opelika, Alabama, Cotter trained with Jerry Redd, who had performed with Elvis Presley and the gospel music group The Stamps Quartet. His first public performance was at the age of nine in a church in Columbus, Georgia.  He recorded five gospel records in the next eight years, and was voted the "top child Gospel soloist in America". He dropped out of performing in his late teen years, then returned to music in Auburn, where he joined the group Silverado.
Cotter left Silverado in 1993 and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he tried to get work as a solo act and a songwriter, landing cuts by Tommy Shane Steiner and Chad Brock, in addition to recording demos. He later competed on and won Nashville Star, then signed to a recording contract with Epic Records. Cotter's debut album Patient Man was released in mid-2004 via Epic, with production by songwriter Steve Bogard. This album produced three chart singles on the country charts, including the Top 40 "I Meant To", but Cotter exited the label before Epic closed its Nashville division in 2005. In 2007, Cotter signed with Adobe Road Records in Nashville, releasing an EP called Continuity.
In 2009, Cotter and Bogard reunited, and Cotter signed to OMG Records. His second full album, Right on Time, was released in June 2009.
