== Career ==


=== Jack White and Third Man Records ===

Because Olivia Jean did not have a band to record with in Nashville, Jack White introduced her to musicians Shelby Lynne and Ruby Rogers.

After their success in the studio, the group decided to become a band. Regarding her first recording session in Nashville, Jean stated in an interview, "Once we all met, we kind of collaborated together and shared ideas, threw all those ideas together and we had a lot of material to work with." Jack White signed The Black Belles to Third Man Records and produced a handful of singles, as well as the bands debut self-titled album The Black Belles, released on October 8, 2011. The band saw moderate success with touring; however, in 2012 the band was put on hiatus.
