Hamid Al-Shaeri (Arabic: حميد الشاعري; born Abdel-Hamid Ali Ahmed; 29 November 1961) is a Libyan-Egyptian singer, songwriter, and musician residing in Cairo. He is known as Egypt's leading representative of westernized synthesizer pop, or Arabic pop. His best known songs include "Law laki" (If Not for You), sung by Ali Hemeida, and "Jaljili", which he sang himself.
On 19 February 2011, Hamid el Shaeri condemned the actions of Muammar Gadaffi, his native country's ruler, against the Libyan people and issued a popular call to the fellow Egyptians to aid them.
He has four children: two daughters, Nabila and Nora EL Shaeri, and two sons, Nadeem and Nouh El Shaeri.
In 2017, Pitchfork described his song "Ayonha" as the "most arresting track" on Habibi Funk's seventh release.
