== Career ==


=== Music ===

Wiebe is known for a high-energy performance style which has led to frequent accidental self-injury, which, in turn, has fed back into his iconic status in Texas punk rock. He suffered a collapsed lung after a crowd-surfing accident in 2016. He once accidentally broke a gas main while swinging from the rafters of a club in Denton, Texas, filling the room with flammable gas.


=== Stand-up comedy ===
Wiebe began performing stand-up in 2011.In both his music and comedy, Wiebe is given to outlandish theatrics and characters. With comic Avery Moore, Wiebe created a pair of satirical Southern youth group ministers, Dottie and Jefferson-Montclaire McCuewan. Wiebe's character as lead singer of Drakulas, Savage Lord Mic, parodies the postapocalyptic style of 1970s movies like The Warriors.Wiebe performs on the 2013 Altercation Punk Comedy Tour compilation Hostile Corporate Takeover, produced by Stand Up! Records.Since 2019, Wiebe has hosted the podcast Contrarian Court with novelist Wayne Gladstone, in which a different unusual opinion such as "bathrobes are stupid" is argued for by each week's guest, with Gladstone and Wiebe acting as opposing counsel and judge.In 2019, he released the single "I Can't Die," a "theme song" for fellow Austin comic Ryan Cownie's Stand Up! Records album I Can't Die.Wiebe co-hosted the 2020 Austin Music Industry Awards.
