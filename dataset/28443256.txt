Leinender is a musician, record producer and DJ born in Bordeaux, France. He has been active since 2004, and is mostly known for his work in Trance music. He is also rated as one of the top DJs in France on the web site The DJ List.As a child in the early 1990s, Leinender was both immersed and amazed by the sounds of the eurodance rage blaring over the local radio stations. He started composing music only at the age of 13, with no prior background in music. At the age of 16 he became actively involved in the industry and co-founded Parallel along with Bordeaux-based Axel Vega, with whom he organized regular tech-house nights in local venues, incorporating innovative DJ Set, Live Performance and live musicians on stage. Later Leinender got more involved in the Trance scene and joined Technotiempo – promoting events in the majors clubs of the area (south of France – North of Spain). In 2005 he signed his first release "Setith Club" with Music Plus, which was licensed and distributed all over Europe. Shortly after in 2006 he was signed on the Horn and Bass main artist roster, with whom he performed live in many concerts and massive open-air events. It is with Horn and Bass that he released his second EP "Corrupted", which was the first to break European's border and receive international exposure on the trance scene.He later launched his own record label Frozenforce as a support for his own production. It is with Frozenforce, that he would release two singles; "Sight of the Unseen" and "Wastefullness", which received extensive press coverage in French and European medias – including electronic music magazine OnlyforDJ's. Later in 2008 he embarked on a new single "Alley Cats" which is a collaborative work with Techno DJ and producer D.R.U.N.K.E.N from Miami, Florida. Leinender also remixed the single "Redemption" of French producer Law, and produced Vincent Licata's trance anthem "Phase Eleven". He later remixed Swedish artist Cryonik with "Soulcure[d]" in 2009.
