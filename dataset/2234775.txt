Sharlee D'Angelo (born Charles Petter Andreason, 27 April 1973) is the Swedish bassist for the melodic death metal band Arch Enemy, as well as the classic rock/AOR band the Night Flight Orchestra, the stoner metal band Spiritual Beggars and the blackened thrash/speed metal band Witchery.
D'Angelo has also been in various bands in the past, either as a studio session player or full member. These include Arch Enemy, Mercyful Fate, Dismember and King Diamond.


== Equipment ==
He plays with Dunlop picks and primarily used Rickenbacker bass guitars in his early career, before switching to playing and endorsing Ibanez Iceman bass guitars in 2005. Ibanez now produces the Sharlee D'Angelo signature bass guitar, called the SDB2, which is tuned to D'Angelo's preferred C standard (Low to High â€“ C, F, Bb, Eb).


== Influences ==
D'Angelo has cited a number of bass players as early influences, including Roger Glover, Glenn Hughes, Steve Dawson, Peter Baltes, and John Entwistle.
