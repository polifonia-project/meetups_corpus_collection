Christine Ott (born 10 August 1963) is a French pianist, vocalist, ondist (a specialist in ondes Martenot), and composer.
She was a member of Yann Tiersen band for eight years and also played for classical orchestras for ten years. She collaborated with Tindersticks, Syd Matters or Jean-Philippe Goude.
She released three solo albums; Solitude Nomade in 2009, Only Silence Remains in 2016 and Chimères (pour Ondes Martenot) in 2020. She also composed an original soundtrack for Murnau's Tabu in 2016. She created several live soundtracks shows, as her work on Lotte Reiniger's movies or on Flaherty's Nanook of the North.
She created the duo Snowdrops with Mathieu Gabry in 2015. Together they composed the original score of Manta Ray (film) by Phuttiphong Aroonpheng, and they released in 2020 the album Volutes on Injazero Records. The Guardian has selected the release in the 10 best contemporary discs of 2020; for the writer John Lewis, "what’s remarkable is how radically different Christine Ott manages to make the ondes sound on each track: from a primeval, guttural sound on the 13-minute Odysseus to a chirruping boy soprano on Ultraviolet."
