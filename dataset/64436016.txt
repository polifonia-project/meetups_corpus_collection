== Career ==


=== 2016: Beginnings ===
Around the age of 14, Kodie Shane began rapping and recorded the first rap song she ever wrote, "Crown Me". At 14, she wrote a song titled "Sad", which would then become her breakout single in 2016. At that age, she would also tag along to a studio owned by her mother. She first worked as a writer for the Atlanta production studio, overseen by D. Clax and Matty P. Warm, both of whom would be future collaborators with her. 
Shane was later discovered by Atlanta record manager Coach K, when Matty P showed her music to him. In early 2016, Coach K introduced Shane to rapper Lil Yachty, during one of his concerts; the two rappers quickly became friends. After Shane played "Sad" to Lil Yachty, he added his own verse to the track. Gaining recognition with the collaboration, Shane signed to Epic Records in 2015 and also joined the "Sailing Team", a collective of rappers led by Lil Yachty, later that year, being the only female member. In August 2016, Lil Yachty released his song "All In" featuring the Sailing Team, helping Shane gain further attention for her guest appearance. Shane's second EP Zero Gravity was released on December 2, 2016, with "Sad" acting as its lead single.


=== 2017-present ===
In August 2017, Shane released her third EP Back to the Future. Her debut studio album Young HeartThrob was released in November 2018. It features guest appearances from Trippie Redd and TK Kravitz.
