== Bullying and harassment allegations ==
In October 2021, the Australian current affairs television program Four Corners aired interviews with Sony Music employees who alleged abuse, intimidation and bullying perpetrated by Handlin during his years in charge at Sony Music Australia. Handlin was alleged to have routinely singled out members of staff for humiliation and intimidation, which left many "traumatised" and resulted in rates of close to 50 per cent annual turnover of staff at the company by the late 1990s. Former head of human resources at Sony Music Australia Greg Lockhart likened working under Handlin to being a "servant" who did not work for Sony Music but rather "Handlin and the 'cult' of his personality".Despite fostering the careers of such female artists as Delta Goodrem, Handlin was alleged to have encouraged a "laddish" culture where female employees were regularly objectified, with Handlin himself alleged to have made sexualised comments about their appearances. He is also alleged to have ordered employees to be fired for "not smiling at him", because he did not like the "look" of them, or for being pregnant, with seven women made redundant while on maternity leave in the period between 2007 and 2013, and "paid cash settlements" following their termination from the company. Lockhart also alleged he was instructed by Handlin to hire private investigators to follow staff. Several anonymous former female employees also alleged they were sexually harassed and assaulted during their time at the company. Handlin said in a statement that while in charge of the company he "would never tolerate treating women in an inappropriate or discriminatory manner" and when informed of incidents, he "took action to ensure that it was stopped and didn't occur again".Handlin was previously suspended by the Sony Music head office in 1998, with 10 executives flown out to Sony Music's global headquarters in New York City for one-on-one interviews regarding Handlin's conduct. Handlin was reinstated three months later, after which the alleged bullying, harassment and routine humiliation of Sony Music Australia staff continued; nine of the 10 interviewed executives left the company within four years. Due to this, Lockhart called Sony Music's global headquarters' claim it only found out about Handlin's behaviour in 2021 "implausible", and called for the "global head office [to] be held accountable for ignoring the welfare of its Australian staff for decades".
