After his studies of saxophone and flute at the Vienna Conservatory Puschnig was the founding member of the Vienna Art Orchestra together with Mathias Rüegg in the mid-1970s. Here he was active until 1989. He was also involved in projects with Ernst Jandl involving Lauren Newton. He also played with Hans Koller in the early 1980s, with the quartet 'Air Mail' and 'Saxofour'. Carla Bley brought him into her groups in the mid 1980s. He worked with Wolfgang Mitterer, Uli Scherer, and his longtime partner Linda Sharrock and Jamaaladeen Tacuma in different groups, and also has cooperated with Reinhard Flatischler, Herbert Joos, Christof Lauer, and Michel Godard. In the project "Alpine Aspects" he started in 1991 with jazz musicians and the Amstetten musicians together (most recently at the JazzFest Berlin  2006 and at Musikfest Waidhofen / Thaya 2007). In addition, he has repeatedly performed with the Korean percussion ensemble SamulNori.Puschnig is Professor at the Universität für Musik und darstellende Kunst Wien and Board of the Institute for Popular Music.
