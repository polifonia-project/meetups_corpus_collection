Scott Lyngdoh, a former state minister of Meghalaya, and Elvirial Nongkynrih. His grand- aunt introduced him to works by Mozart and Beethoven at an early age.

=== Shillong Chamber Choir ===

Nongkynrih came back home to Shillong in India in 2001 after fourteen years in Europe leaving behind a potential career as a classical pianist there. In a later interview he referred to the violence in the region and said he had heard the sounds of the guns early in 2001 and decided that he wanted to replace it with the sound of music. From a small beginning he attracted a group of ordinary young people who made their debut as the Shillong Chamber Choir. The group covered music from folk to opera, from rock to jazz, and even included Hindustani classical and reinterpreted versions of Indian cinematic music.The choir shot to national fame after it won the reality talent show, India's Got Talent (Season 2) in October 2010, on Colors TV, part of the Got Talent franchise, where it performed western chorals, as well as choral-style revamps of Hindi film (Bollywood) classics. Under Nongkynrih's direction, the choir participated in the 6th World Choir Games held at Shaoxing China (Shanghai) in July 2010 and was awarded Gold in all three categories viz. Musica Sacra, Gospel and Popular. The choir also performed for Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, the US President and first lady at the time, during their visit to India in 2010.  The choir also worked on several projects, albums and collaborations. Nongkynrih's version of "Vande Mataram" was sung by the SCC on National Geographic during a live telecast covering the launch of Chandrayaan-2.The SCC has performed extensively in India and has toured parts of the world.
