== Biography ==
Park is a native of Udo Island, Jinhae-gu, Changwon. He had childhood ambitions to be an entertainer and appear on TV since his fifth year of primary school. His mother was against it and, when Park was attending his sixth year, she sent him to an audition for SM Entertainment, agreeing that, if he failed, he would give up; however, he made it to the third and final preliminary round and won the popularity award. As the family's opposition diminished, the same year he started taking dance classes at Busan Dance School in Seomyeon, although he didn't take it seriously for the first three months until his father reproached him. After three months of intense practice, he was able to dance, and in 2009 he successfully auditioned for JYP Entertainment, winning first place at the open audition with Jay B over 10,000 applicants. At that time he only liked dancing, but, thinking seriously about his future, he realized that he loved music as a whole.
