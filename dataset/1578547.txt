Josh Eric Eppard (born December 6, 1979) is an American musician from Kingston, New York and the drummer for progressive rock band Coheed and Cambria. He has worked as a solo rapper under the name Weerd Science and was the drummer for supergroup rock band Terrible Things. Josh was a founding member of the Woodstock, NY new prog outfit 3 along with his brother Joey and studio engineer Chris Bittner.
On November 2, 2006 it was announced that Josh would be leaving Coheed and Cambria indefinitely, with Chris Pennie as his replacement. The reason for his abrupt departure from the band had been shrouded in mystery. However, in an interview with Michael Dodd of Get Your Rock Out, Josh laid the rumours to rest. Though there was speculation Josh had left the band due to "creative limitations", his split from the band actually resulted from a bout with drug addiction that had been exacerbated by the frantic touring schedule, among other things. Citing an often asked question of him as to whether he quit the band or was fired, Josh's response was that he was likely "about to be fired" before he left.After leaving Coheed and Cambria, Josh recorded his second Weerd Science album, Sick Kids, at Darkworld Studio in Kingston, NY and Applehead Studios in Woodstock, NY. The album is a creative look into the drug addiction the artist suffered, offering, in addition to a very trying personal account, an insightful social commentary on the current condition of the United States. More recently, he also formed a new rock band, Mours, with friend and collaborator Dave Parker and musician Anthony Masington.
In 2009, Josh began drumming in Terrible Things, a band he formed with fellow musicians Fred Mascherino, Andy Jackson, and bassist Steve Lucarelli, who has since left the band. They have been touring and released their debut, Terrible Things on Universal Motown on August 31, 2010. In 2011, Josh signed with Horris Records.On November 16, 2011, Coheed and Cambria revealed on their website that Josh had officially rejoined the band. On the Terrible Things YouTube channel, Terrible Things vocalist Fred Mascherino announced that Josh had left Terrible Things.
