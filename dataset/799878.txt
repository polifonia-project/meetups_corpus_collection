Marie Eleonor Serneholt (Swedish pronunciation: [maˈriː ˈsæ̂ːɳɛˌhɔlt]; born 11 July 1983) is a Swedish singer and model. She was a member of the Swedish pop band A*Teens from 1998 to 2004, and briefly pursued a solo recording career after the band dissolved.


== Career ==


=== A*Teens (1998–2006) ===

In 1998, Serneholt signed a recording deal with Stockholm Records (part of Universal Music Group) along with her bandmates Sara Lumholdt, Dhani Lennevald, and Amit Sebastian Paul. Together they performed as the A*Teens. In 1999, they released their first single, a cover of Swedish pop group ABBA's Mamma Mia. The single topped the charts in Sweden for eight consecutive weeks, and achieved international success.By 2000, the A*Teens' first album, The ABBA Generation, had sold two million copies, and they became one of the most internationally successful Swedish pop bands. By 2001, the group had sold more than six million albums. In 2004, it released a Greatest Hits album, and in 2006 the group broke up.


=== Music hiatus (2005) ===
With the A*Teens split, it was rumored that Serneholt would be the first to pursue a solo career. This proved to be unfounded when Lennevald released his debut single in September 2004. In 2005, Serneholt was picked as the face of the Maybelline cosmetics line in Scandinavia. She also gave her voice for the Swedish versions of the movies Robots and Herbie: Fully Loaded.


=== Enjoy the Ride (2006–2008) ===
In 2005, Serneholt called Jörgen Elofsson, who had written music for Britney Spears and Céline Dion. Elofsson was busy with other artists at the time, but Serneholt was adamant to have him produce an album for her. When she contacted him again later that year, he had just started collaborating with two relatively young and unknown producers, Richard Brandén and Pär Westerlund.

Elofsson created the label Planet Six (a part of Sony BMG), and Serneholt signed her first recording deal as a solo artist. In February 2006, Serneholt's first single, "That's The Way My Heart Goes", premiered on Swedish radio with decent reviews and good response from the public. The single debuted at No. 2 on the Swedish Charts and reached No. 1 on the official Swedish Digital Downloads Chart, ensuring Gold Status on physical sales alone on 19 May 2006.The album Enjoy the Ride was released on 29 March 2006, debuting at No. 9 in her home country but dropping off the charts quickly, while the single's success was growing around the world with releases throughout Europe along with the album and with plans to release it in South and North America in 2007. In May 2006, Serneholt started a promotional tour in Germany coinciding with the German release of her album. She embarked on a Radio Station's Concert Tour of Sweden and Finland. In June, Serneholt released her second single, "I Need a House", which debuted at No. 2 on the Swedish Digital Downloads Chart, but failed on the physical sales as it reached only No. 40 in Sweden. The single was released in Europe in September 2006. On 19 August 2006, Serneholt performed at Voice '06 in the Kungsträdgården park in Stockholm.
