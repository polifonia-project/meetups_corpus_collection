== Biography ==
Robin Luke was discovered by Hawaii entrepreneur Kimo Wilder McVay. Luke was living in Honolulu, Hawaii, attending Punahou School, in 1958 when he wrote and recorded "Susie Darlin'", a song named after his then five-year-old sister, Susie. The track reached #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #23 on the UK Singles Chart, selling over one million copies and earning a gold disc. He continued to record, but was unable to repeat his chart success. His first four singles were recorded for the small International Records label in Honolulu.  After "Susie Darlin'" started getting local airplay, Dot Records bought his recording contract and the International master tapes.
Robin Luke stated that he never envisioned pursuing music as a career and quit the professional music business in 1965. As of 2012, he still performs occasionally on the side. He received his Ph.D. in Business Administration and Marketing at the University of Missouri-Columbia, and served as a professor at Old Dominion University, the University of the Virgin Islands, and Missouri State University. He became Department Head at Old Dominion University and Missouri State University.
