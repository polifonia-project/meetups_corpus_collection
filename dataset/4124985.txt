== Life and career ==


=== Early life ===
Mirković was born on 18 January 1968, in Kasidol, a village near Požarevac, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia. The youngest of two children, she grew up in the same household as her parents, grandparents and sister Dušica. Mirković has described her upbringing as "Yugoslav", noting the peaceful co-existence between Slavs of different faiths at the time. A musical influence in her youth was her grandfather, Dragutin, who played the accordion. At the age of five, she learned to sing the Bosnian folk song "Djevojka sokolu zulum učinila". Mirković recalled that she cried because of the events portrayed in the song. As a child, she began singing as a soloist in elementary school performances and competitions. Later, she would sing at various celebrations in Kasidol, which caught the attention of record executives.


=== 1984–1991: Early success and Južni vetar ===
When she was 14, executives at the Diskos record label approached Mirković's parents with the idea of having her record a song in their studio. The result was Imam dečka nemirnog, released as a full studio album in 1984. Her second album Umiljato oko moje was released in 1985 and sold 250,000 copies. In the mid-1980s Mirković began her collaboration with the music band Južni Vetar, composed of Miodrag Ilić as the bass guitarist, Sava Bojić lead guitarist and Perica Zdravković for keyboard. Spasi me samoće released in 1986, was her first album with the group and sold over 400,000 copies. The single of the same name was a major hit. In addition to Mirković, the musical formation utilized other singers from Bosnia and Serbia and enjoyed wide support from Yugoslavs, as folk music became the best-selling genre of the 1980s. She went on to record four more albums with Južni Vetar: Ruže cvetaju samo u pesmama (1987), Najlepši par (1988), Simpatija (1989) and Pomisli želju (1990). The single "Simpatija" (Crush) became a major commercial success.

After the release of her seventeenth studio album, Sama, with hit singles "Svatovi" and the title track, she went on a four-year hiatus. In 2001, Mirković performed live at the Vienna Künstlerhaus as part of a contemporary art exhibition, with many of those in attendance being Yugoslav migrant workers.
