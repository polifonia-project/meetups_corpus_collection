Below has in recent years started a sister division, Distort Light, in order to include bands like Bend Sinister.

"his enthusiasm was amazing. We’re probably a bit of an experiment of a band for him, because I know Greg and he just loves good music. He’s trying to branch out and have more bands from different genres, but his main love is metal" - Dan Moxon (Vocalist/Keyboard From Bend Sinister) Quote from Exclaim Magazine


== Distort Productions ==
Similarly named, Distort Productions also owned by Below, is a concert promotion company which is known for bringing acts like Slipknot and System Of A Down to Canada. Acourding to an interview with Mitch Joel, Distort Entertainment's name was derived from Distort Productions, which was already established prior to Joel and Below becoming partners.
