== Early life ==
Waters was born in Kathmandu, Nepal. He moved to India at a young age, before moving to Germany at age four, and then relocating to Calgary, Alberta at age ten. Waters settled in Cary, North Carolina in 2017 at age seventeen. The moves were following his parents' educational dreams—his father now has a PhD in environmental science, while his mother has two masters degrees and specializes in GIS.When he was 14,Waters returned to Nepal for three months for his Bratabanda, a complex Hindu coming of age ceremony.In 2014, Waters downloaded FL Studio onto his laptop and started to make beats. “Waters says, "Being from a Nepali immigrant family, my parents always want the best from me academically. They didn’t really understand my love for music at first. So I did it secretly in my room." His musical influences include Frank Ocean, Kanye West, Odd Future, Tyler the Creator, and Joy Division’s Ian Curtis. By 2017, he was posting his music online.As a teenager in Canada, Waters used music and graphic design to overcome depression. In the process, he created a comic book character named Curtis Waters, an homage to two of his favorite artists—Ian Curtis and Frank Ocian. He says, "This character was fun, bright and silly. I started to dress like him, and when I made music, I could make myself feel like this person in my head.” By 2017, he was posting his music online as Frank Waters.In 2018, Waters began his freshman year at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, studying in media studies. He also worked at Tropical Smoothie Cafe.
