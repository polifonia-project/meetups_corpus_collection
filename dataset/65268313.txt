== Early life ==
Denarie B. Poarch was born on February 8, 1997, in the Philippines to Filipino biological parents. She was raised by her grandmother in the slums until the age of three and was then adopted by her adoptive family. Her adoptive father is a white American who had served in the US military and her adoptive mother is Filipino; both adoptive parents had met in Saudi Arabia where her adoptive father was stationed, before settling in the Philippines. In an interview, she recounts that she and her adopted brother were heavily abused all throughout her childhood, up until her enrollment in the military. She lived on a farm with her family: two older (adopted) sisters, her adoptive parents, and her brother. She had many of the responsibilities for the farm, even as young as seven years old. She recounts that her adoptive sisters did not receive the same treatment as her. Poarch says that her father was verbally and physically abusive, while her mother did not get involved. Her family (except her two older sisters who still reside in the Philippines) moved to San Francisco to live with her aunt for a couple of months, before the family moved to Texas when she was 13 due to her father's need for bypass surgery. She says that the abuse decreased, but she still faced some mental abuse from her father at home.

In May 2021, Poarch signed a record deal with Warner Records.
On May 14, 2021, Poarch released her debut single "Build a Bitch". The associated music video, which appeared on YouTube, was described by Billboard as "an audacious, darkly comic slice of new-school pop", created with Daniel Virgil Maisonneuve, the producer-songwriter better known as Sub Urban." The video features other notable internet personalities including Valkyrae, Mia Khalifa, Bretman Rock and ZHC.On an episode of the 100 Thieves podcast "The CouRage and Nadeshot Show", Poarch said that the song traces back to her own history of being bullied as a child.

Poarch has publicly expressed her support in the fight against anti-Asian racism because of the rise in hate crimes towards the Asian-American community. On March 19, 2021, she uploaded a video to TikTok to speak on the topic and spread the message. She also shared her experiences with Vogue, saying that she can relate to this situation because she has been "treated differently" and "randomly attacked and assaulted" as an Asian teen after moving to the U.S. from the Philippines.Poarch was criticized for having a tattoo similar to the Rising Sun Flag in her videos. The specific tattoo resembled a symbol of Japanese imperialism which may be considered offensive to some Southeast and East Asians. In September 2020, she apologized and immediately had it covered.
