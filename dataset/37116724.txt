Alec Reinstein (born May 7, 1982), better known by his stage name Despot, is an American hip hop artist from Queens, New York City. He was signed to rapper El-P's label Definitive Jux in 2004. Despot has been a part of the New York underground rap scene for over a decade. Despot is associated with the Smart Crew collective and was a co-owner of Santos Party House.


== Early life and education ==
Despot grew up in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens. He became involved in hip-hop at an early age, claiming that its prevalence amongst kids in his neighborhood made him appreciate rap. Around the age of twelve, Despot began to hang out with a Brooklyn gang called the Lo-Lives, most notable for wearing Polo Ralph Lauren clothing. Despot identifies himself as hopelessly addicted to sneakers and Polo clothing.Despot claims to have been more of a delinquent as a teenager because he constantly listened to Mobb Deep's The Infamous. Upon buying 6 Feet Deep, supergroup Gravediggaz' first album, Despot wore baggy pants and carried a Panasonic boom box around with him. He was given the nickname "Puff" because of his marijuana use. During his years in junior high school, Despot and his friends rapped over an instrumental tape of "Worldwide" by Royal Flush. Despot's friends told him he was the most talented of the group, and he began to write rhymes.He attended high school in Manhattan, where he and friend Yak Ballz (who was also signed to Definitive Jux) would frequent Footwork, the East Village record store owned by radio personality Bobbito Garc√≠a. It was through Garcia that Despot would eventually meet El-P. After graduating high school Despot attended SUNY Purchase, but later dropped out "after realizing it was boring." Despot still went back to the school to organize its Culture Shock festival in 2004 and 2005, and he performed at the event in 2007.


== Career ==
In 2001, Despot recorded the song "Cynical Bastards" with Lo-Deck on Atoms Family member Cryptic One's album Euphony. The track garnered attention from El-P, who asked Despot to record for Definitive Jux. Despot released "Homesickness" as a single on Def Jux Presents 3 in 2004. Following "Homesickness", Despot had his plans in making his album stalled, primarily because of his not spending time working on the album. He also believed a neurotic perfectionism prevented him from releasing songs more quickly. Despite never releasing the album, he released a number of songs during his time at Definitive Jux, including "Crap Artists" and "Look Alive", which was produced by Ratatat. Despot toured with Ratatat in 2007, and his forthcoming album will feature their production.Despot claimed to have finished his first full-length album, a collaborative effort with Ratatat featuring songs from Blockhead, as early as June 2008. The album was initially named Jerry (after his father) and then Hooray for Me before finally arriving at We're All Excited. The first single was released July 13, 2015, titled "House of Bricks", despite being performed live regularly since 2012. On July 22, 2015, Despot released a music video for "House of Bricks", directed by Ratatat's E*vax.
