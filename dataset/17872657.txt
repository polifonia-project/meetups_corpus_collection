Christopher's first single release, "The Quest", was released on 8 June 2008 through Polydor Records. The single draws on his brother's personal experience as a soldier stationed in Basra. His brother two years later would be injured in Afghanistan losing both of his legs. "The Quest" was featured in the closing scene of Grey's Anatomy's season 4 conclusion, which caused the song to become more known in the US. The song was made into a music video for the show to promote its fifth season, with scenes of Christopher singing in London as well as scenes from the show. The song was also featured in an episode of the BBC school-based drama Waterloo Road.
It was also covered by Grigory Leps in Russian which became a popular version.

Midi Mafia secured the exclusive rights to use samples from the Stax Records Catalogue, and has used some of these for the first time ever on Christopher's album.
