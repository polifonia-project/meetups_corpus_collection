In the summer of 2015, Tel launched a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo
in order to produce a remix album (called 'Tel Me More') of his best C64 music. Of the $38,911 (a nod to the amount of free memory bytes when starting up a Commodore 64) goal, $27,420 was reached by a total of 699 backers. On August 8, 2015, Tel gave an update on his Indiegogo page stating that this was sufficient to create the album and deliver all the promised perks. As of November 2021, the album and the promised perks still need to be delivered. In posts on the campaign page, he claims to still be working on completing the project as of February 2020.
