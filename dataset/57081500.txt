== Early life ==
Isaih Rivera was born on March 20, 1997, in the Bronx borough of New York City, to a Puerto Rican mother and a Jamaican father. Rivera was raised by his mother. His biological father, who was a freestyle battle rapper in The Bronx, left the family when Rivera was only three years old. When he turned seven, the family moved to Palm Beach, Florida. His mother and stepfather later broke up when Rivera was 12.
Rivera was originally known as Izzy Kill$, but later chose to go under the name Wifisfuneral, which he got from his close friend DJ Scheme. Rivera's interest in hip-hop began when he first watched The Notorious B.I.G.. tribute "Mo Money Mo Problems" music video with Puff Daddy and Ma$e.

After dropping out of high school and being kicked out of his house during his sophomore year, Rivera began working on his dream of success in the hip hop industry. While recording music during this time, he battled with substance abuse problems, including Cocaine, Xanax and Adderall. While working on Black Heart Revenge, Rivera unintentionally overdosed on cocaine and adderall. After recovering, he resumed his work on the album while getting his addiction under control.Rivera released When Hell Falls on January 27, 2017. It was originally his suicide note, but he decided to turn it into an album instead. The project took a total of two weeks to complete, and upon release, attracted the attention of Alamo Records and Interscope Records, who he later signed with. His next mixtape, Boy Who Cried Wolf, named after the popular fable by Aesop, was released later in the year to positive reception.
He was also a member of Members Only, a group originally created by XXXTentacion and Ski Mask the Slump God, from 2015 to 2017.

Despite previously announcing his intention to retire from music, Wifisfuneral released his debut studio album, Pain?, on August 28, 2020. On the concept of the album, which documents his trials and tribulations, he stated: "I've been working on the album for a couple of years now. It's been a really big process going from the underground circuit to making records. I didn't want to make it a regular rap album, I wanted every song to capture the emotion for anyone who's listening.
