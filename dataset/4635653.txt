== Equipment ==
Padden has been seen using the Explorer model guitar, made by RAN Guitars, at Annihilator live events and it has been assumed that he's recorded with these same guitars. Once bandmate Jeff Waters left RAN Guitars, so did Padden. Instead of playing Epiphone's, after this, he's now a Dean endorser and plays both Deceiver and Z models. He's been seen using an Epiphone Prophecy Futura Ex custom with Seymour Duncan pickups.
