Asahito Nanjo (南條麻人) is a Japanese underground musician, best known for his psychedelic rock groups High Rise, Mainliner and Musica Transonic, and the ethnic improvisation unit Toho Sara. He has been active on the Tokyo underground scene since the late seventies.
Part of his sonic aesthetic is to record, mix, and master using extreme levels of distortion, dynamic range compression, and clipping making the sound of the instruments unrecognizable.  The results can be said to contain elements of noise music.
