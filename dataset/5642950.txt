Patrik Jensen (born 24 November 1969) is a Swedish guitarist and co-founder of the bands, The Haunted (1996-present), and Witchery (1997-present), and also the former guitarist of the bands Orchriste (1987-1990), Seance (1990-1995) Satanic Slaughter (1994-1996) and Brujeria (1997).
Jensen received his first guitar when he was seven years old, but started playing when he was sixteen years old - he took guitar lessons for five years thereafter. Jensen plays his signature E1.6 Jensen from Solar Guitars[1]  and uses Engl amplification and EMG pick-ups (85/81).
In 2013, Jensen played some live shows with In Flames for Niclas Engelin, when Engelin was unable to play, due to becoming a father.
