== Career ==


=== 1996–1997: Debut album ===
Amber's music career took off when one of her demos, "This Is Your Night", was released by Tommy Boy Records. The single was on the Hot 100 chart for one year in 1996 and 1997. A full-length album soon followed. It included another hit single "One More Night".


=== 1998–1999: Self-titled second album ===
In 1999 Amber released her eponymous second album which garnered the most mainstream attention thus far. The first single "Sexual (Li Da Li)" achieved success in the US Billboard charts as well as charting across Europe. The album also included the single "If You Could Read My Mind" by Stars on 54 (a collaboration with Ultra Naté and Jocelyn Enriquez) which was featured on the soundtrack to the movie 54.


=== 2000: Remixed and Grammy nomination ===
In 2000, Amber released the album Remixed, which contained remixes of all her previous singles, including "If You Could Read My Mind". It also included a non-album track "Taste the Tears", produced by Thunderpuss and was written by Diane Warren, which had previously appeared on the TV soundtrack for Sex and The City. Sex and The City also already had used Amber's titles 'Above the clouds' and 'Object of your desire' prior.
In 2001, she received a Grammy nomination as the co- writer of "Love One Another" for Cher's cover version and she co-wrote music for Bette Midler.


=== 2001–2003: Naked and departure from Tommy Boy Records ===
Amber's third album Naked was released in early 2002. Musically, Amber continued the path she had started with: she continued to co-write her own songs and lyrics and attempted even more of a departure from her original Eurodance sound. Amber parted ways with Tommy Boy Records after her third album because of creative differences.


=== 2004–2006: My Kind of World ===
Amber's fourth album, My Kind of World, was the first to be released on her own label JMCA Enterprises, and was more personal and moodier than her previous releases. The album did not gain mainstream attention. Three singles were taken from the album, "You Move Me", "Voodoo" and "Just Like That".


=== 2008–present: Remixes and current status ===
In 2008 she re-released her debut single "This Is Your Night" with new remixes. The song had not been made available digitally, as Tommy Boy Records defaulted in 2001 and gave Warner Music all their masters, where they were shelved instead of distributed. In 2006, she collaborated with the producer Sweet Rains and wrote and released a title named "Melt with the sun". In August 2008 she collaborated with Zelma Davis of C+C Music Factory fame on a cover of "No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)", the classic duet by Donna Summer and Barbra Streisand. Both songs were accompanied by new music videos. In 2009, she released another single named "I don't believe in hate (Drip Drop)". All of her singles were released with multiple remixes.
In 2009 Amber was the closing act at Baltimore's gay pride festival on Saturday, 20 June 2009. In 2010 she was the closing act at Pittsburgh's gay pride festival on 13 June 2010. Amber was one of the headlining performers at the Portland Pride Festival on 20 June 2010. She was also the closing act at Providence Gay Pride on 19 June 2010. Amber performed as one of the headline acts at 2013 Stonewall Summer Pride in Wilton Manors, Florida.
