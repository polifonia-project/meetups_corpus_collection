== Career ==


=== 2000 ===
Yaida first became well known when her first single ("Howling" which included the track "How?") was released in 2000 on Aozora records, an independent label pre-dominantly distributing to the Kansai area of Osaka only, and reportedly sold in excess of 10,000 copies. Widespread airplay on Osaka's local radio stations and word-of-mouth resulted in both Yaida and Aozora records becoming the focus of a bidding war between the larger record companies for both recording and distribution contracts, the final Japanese distributing rights being sold to Toshiba-EMI with Aozora retaining artist control and independent label status.
"B'coz I Love You" was the first single released under contract, entering the Japanese charts at number 16 in July.
Through the association with Toshiba-EMI, live appearances in the UK (both London and Manchester) followed in September. This initial British exposure culminated in the release of the UK Single "I Like 2" under her nickname Yaiko on F2Records, which created the impetus for a UK fan-base to grow. Her second Toshiba-EMI single, "My Sweet Darlin'", released in October entered the charts at number 9 quickly followed by her first album (daiya-monde) which went straight to Number 1 in the Oricon album charts.
During this time she was still attending Kansai University, reading French language and literature. Yaida took a short sabbatical from her musical career to prepare her thesis for submission in the latter part of the year.

The second UK Single, "Darling Darling", was released on January 1, 2000, at a special live appearance in London. Building on the success of "I Like 2", this release again featured remixes of her Japanese tracks with English lyrics to appeal to the UK club market.Between the period January 15 – February 20 she was hospitalised because of exhaustion. During which, "I'm Here Saying Nothing" was released in Japan (entering at number 4) and "Darling Darling" reached number 1 in the UK club chart.She graduated from Kansai University with a degree in French language and literature on March 19, starting her first official Japanese tour on the 21st (the seven date 'I'm Here...' tour) followed immediately by live appearances in Liverpool, Manchester, Aberdeen, Glasgow and London.
