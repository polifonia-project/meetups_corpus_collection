== Biography ==
Gojo held a normal office job after graduating university. However she soon quit because she wanted a music-related job, and subsequently enrolled to a voice training class. She started out as a backup singer for J-pop artists. She was introduced by her voice trainer to the late Miki Matsubara, who offered her to sing an insert song for the 1999 anime series Ojamajo Doremi. It became her debut song "Mahou de Choi2" and she went on to record several more songs for the series.
In 2004, she performed the opening theme for the first Pretty Cure series "Danzen! Futari wa PreCure", one of her best known songs. The song was awarded the Radio Kansai Award for best theme song at the 9th Animation Kobe Awards that year.She released her first original album Iridescent in 2005 under an independent label. It was re-released by Marvelous Entertainment in 2007 with three new additional tracks as Iridescent+. That same year she also released Mayumi Gojo Vocal Best from Futari wa PreCure, a compilation of her Pretty Cure songs.
In 2008, she joined Project.R to sing for the Super Sentai Series.
