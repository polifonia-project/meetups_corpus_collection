He has written or co-written 80 hits in the UK and 143 in the US charts.Holland served as the team's lyricist, and also worked with producer Norman Whitfield on lyrics for the songs he produced for the Marvelettes and the Temptations, like "Too Many Fish in the Sea" and "Beauty Is Only Skin Deep".Holland also composed songs for the First Wives Club musical.
