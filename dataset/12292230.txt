Calvin Richardson (born December 16, 1976) is an American R&B and soul singer-songwriter. In 1999, he released his debut solo album Country Boy. He is also known by the nickname "Prince of Soul."


== Background ==
He is friends with K-Ci & JoJo whom he met while singing on the gospel circuit. Richardson was signed to Tommy Boy Records in the early 1990s as a member of the R&B group Undacova, whose song "Love Slave" appeared on the soundtrack to the 1995 film New Jersey Drive.


== Career ==
In the mid 1990s, Richardson went solo and signed with Universal Records. His debut album, Country Boy, was released on August 24, 1999, selling 100,000 units. Despite this he was dropped by Universal. Shortly thereafter, he signed a contract with Hollywood Records.
On September 16, 2003, he released his second album, 2:35 pm. The album was given that name because Richardson's child was born at that time, just before completing the album. It featured the minor R&B hit "Keep On Pushin'", a song Richardson wrote and produced by himself. He originally recorded the song "More Than a Woman" a duet with Angie Stone which originally appeared on her 2001 album Mahogany Soul. Richardson would later re-record the song as a solo track for 2:35 pm. An alternate version of the song – which replaces Richardson's vocals with new ones from Joe- was nominated for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 2003 Grammy Awards. The album also included popular songs such as The Underdogs produced single "Not Like This" as well as the Raphael Saadiq produced "Falling Out". The album was produced by The Underdogs, Jake & Trevor, Young RJ, and Raphael Saadiq.
Richardson then co-wrote and performed on the track "Excuse Me", from Saadiq's 2002 Grammy Award nominated album Instant Vintage, as well as co-writing The Charlie Wilson single produced by Babyface "There Goes My Baby".
Richardson released his third album, When Love Comes, on May 27, 2008, on Shanachie Records. In 2009, he was chosen to record a tribute album to Bobby Womack, which coincided with Womack being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The Grammy nominated album was entitled, Facts Of Life: The Soul Of Bobby Womack. On August 31, 2010, Richardson released his fifth album, Americas Most Wanted. The lead single was "You're So Amazing".

=== Influences ===
Richardson cites Babyface as a major influence on him.: "Babyface has made a significant impact on my future. I mean, Babyface is Babyface. He’s great. There’s nothing else to say. I learned a lot from him." He also cites R. Kelly: "R. Kelly is somebody I really wanted to work with. He has run into some unfortunate situations as of late, but it doesn’t take away, for me, the greatness that’s there. I have always been impressed by his depth of creativity. When the opportunity was there, I didn’t do it. But he has always been someone I looked up to on the creative side." Old-school artists have also influenced him: "I lean more to old-school artists like Al Green, Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke and Bobby Womack. K-Ci Hailey (of Jodeci and K-Ci & JoJo) is a good friend of mine. He’s like my brother. We’re still tight to this day. He was one of the most incredible voices I have ever heard. His voice has changed over the years, but he is definitely on my Mount Rushmore. Did I say Stevie Wonder?"
