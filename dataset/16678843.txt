He went back to Chicago, where he played with Dave Peyton (1930), the Chicago Ramblers (1932), Johnny Dodds and Baby Dodds, Zutty Singleton, Mezz Mezzrow, Lovie Austin, and Jimmy Bertrand (1945).Collins played in Chicago through the 1930s and 1940s as an accompanist to many blues singers and in nightclubs.

He played in Europe with Mezz Mezzrow in 1951 and 1954 and in California with Joe Sullivan in 1953. In the mid-1950s he retired because of illness.Collins wrote an autobiography, Oh, Didn't He Ramble, with the aid of his wife, Mary, which was originally published in 1974.Collins died in Chicago in July 1960, at the age of 58.
