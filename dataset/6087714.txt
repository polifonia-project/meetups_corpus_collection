Jarle Vespestad (born 16 April 1966) is a Norwegian jazz musician (percussion), the younger brother of jazz musician Liz Tove Vespestad, and a central member of Tord Gustavsen's projects.


== Career ==

Vespestad was born in Kirkenes and picked up drumming in the local marching band, but drumming first became serious after finishing high school, where he found himself heading into a future as a substitute teacher at his local high-school. He made up his mind and graduated from the Toneheim Folk High School (1988) and Jazz program at Trondheim Musikkonservatorium (1990). In Trondheim he became the driving force behind many successful bands to come out of Trondheim the following years, like Veslefrekk, "Trondheim Kunstorkester", Farmers Market (1991–) and the Maria Kannegaard trio (1993–). In addition he was drummer with the Embla Nordic in Copenhagen.
In Oslo Vespestad has worked with different groups since 1996, releasing albums with Sigurd Køhn (More Pepper please) and Anders Jormin (Once) in 1996. He also cooperated with Silje Nergaard, Supersilent and Tord Gustavsen. He released the duo album Orbit (1998) and toured with Gustavsen's trio. For more than two decades he has been a leading drummer on the Norwegian jazz scene, within bands like Supersilent, Petter Wettre Trio and Quartet and Håvard Wiik Trio, in addition to Tord Gustavsen Trio, Silje Nergaard, Embla Nordic and Veslefrekk.
