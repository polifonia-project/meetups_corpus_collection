== Life and work ==
Doldinger was born in Berlin, Germany, and entered a Düsseldorf conservatory in 1947, originally studying piano and then clarinet, graduating in 1957. In his student years, Doldinger gained professional performing experience, starting in 1953 in the German Dixieland band The Feetwarmers, and recording with them in 1955. Later that year he founded Oscar's Trio' modeled on Oscar Peterson's work. During the 1960s, he worked as a tenor saxophonist, working with visiting American jazz musicians, Beat groups like Ian and the Zodiacs and recording in his own right.

Doldinger's recurring jazz project Passport, started in 1971 (then called "Klaus Doldinger's Passport"), still enjoys success in Germany. In its influence it was sometimes called the European version of Weather Report.At various times members of Passport included Peter O'Mara (guitar), Roberto DiGioia (keyboards), Patrick Scales (bass, since 1994), Ernst Stroer (de:Ernst Ströer) (percussion, since 1989), Christian Lettner (drums, since 2000), Michael Hornek (keyboard since 2009), Biboul Darouiche (percussion, since 1995) and others. Guests include Brian Auger (1973), Johnny Griffin (1973) and Pete York (1973). The first true Passport album had strong ties to Amon Düül II, containing contributions from Olaf Kübler, Lothar Meid and Jimmy Jackson.
Doldinger contributed film scores to the German U-boat film Das Boot (1981) and later The NeverEnding Story (1984). He also composed the musical theme of the long ongoing German-Austrian-Swiss series, Tatort (Crime scene).
Doldinger married Inge Beck in 1960; they have three children, Viola, Melanie and Nicolas Doldinger. Since 1968, they have resided in Icking, a small Bavarian village, south of Munich.
