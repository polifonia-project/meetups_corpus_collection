== Works ==
Frolova-Walker's interest in historiography of Russian music and the nationalist/exoticist myths resulted in the book titled Russian Music and Nationalism: from Glinka to Stalin (2008), which is considered her magnum opus. It has received generally favourable reviews from critics. Andrew Wachtel, although pointing out several errors and shortcomings, wrote that it "will be important for all scholars interested in manifestations of Russian nationalist thinking and/or in the process of cultural nation-building."In 2011-13 she held a Major Research Fellowship from the [Leverhulme Trust], which allowed her to pursue extensive archival research in [Russia], leading to the publication of Stalin's Music Prize: Soviet Culture and Politics (Yale University Press, 2016).
