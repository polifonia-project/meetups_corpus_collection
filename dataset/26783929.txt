=== Childhood and studies ===
Svante Henryson grew up in Umeå in northern Sweden. His father was a Full Professor of Education, and his mother a Director of Studies in English at Umeå University.
At age 12, after falling in love-at-a-distance with a female bassist at a concert, Svante began playing bass guitar in a rock band. Two years later, he switched to jazz and double bass. A concert with Stan Getz at the Umeå Jazz Festival made up his mind about becoming a musician.
Another life-changing experience was hearing the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra in concert in Östersund.

he became bass guitarist of Yngwie Malmsteen's band 1989–1992.
During this period he started playing cello, an instrument on which he is an autodidact.
