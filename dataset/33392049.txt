== Benefit Recordings ==
McCorkle has engaged in benefit recordings to celebrate prestigious organizations and their efforts to support the musical community. Such an event took place in the summer of 2011 to honor From The Top  and their new Center for the Development of Arts Leaders (CDAL) Boston with the track "And The Sound is Music." Another benefit recording was in early 2011 to celebrate Wingspan Arts    and their extraordinary outreach program with the track "Blackbird (Fly Into The Light)." 
In 2013, McCorkle put on a big band gala in the ballroom of The Hallmark (Battery Park City's senior residence). The goal of the evening was to recreate the zeitgeist of the early 1930s big band era for the center's residents while raising money for Alzheimer's research. The night was recorded and released as a digital download on Bandcamp. All ticket and record sales were benefited the Alzheimer's Foundation of America.
