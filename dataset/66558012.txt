The organisation’s filing described them as a digital human technology company, focused on the development, collection, protection and preparation of the personal digital likeness assets, of celebrities and consumers, for use in artificial intelligence, entertainment, personal productivity and social networking. when it acquired Fubo TV. Allywatch described the acquisition as a reverse merger that effectively enabled Fubo TV to operate as a public company. Fubo claimed that the merger expanded the organization's presence in the over-the-top television industry

In April 2020, Textor completed the acquisition of fuboTV Media. via zoom call. Thusly, Fubo went public. and in under two years, grew to an NYSE-listed market value of more than $6 billion.In the spring of 2020, Textor resigned from his post as Executive Chairman of fuboTV while remaining a member of the board of directors.

==== Digital Domain ====
In May 2006, Textor acquired Digital Domain with film director Michael Bay. Textor and Bay, as co-chairman, led the $30 million acquisition and restructuring of Digital Domain from May 2006, to a doubling of revenues and cash flow by 2010, and an NYSE valuation of $450 million in Spring 2012. The company was responsible for the visual effects of more than 80 large scale feature films, including such blockbusters as Transformers, Flags of our Fathers, Tron: Legacy, Real Steel, Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End, and Thor.Under Textor's leadership, Digital Domain was re-established as a market leader in visual effects, winning multiple Academy Awards, Clio awards, and being recognized as the first visual effects company to deliver a believable digital human actor in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This achievement, known as the ‘Holy Grail of Visual Effects’, earned the company a 2009 Academy Award for Achievement in Visual Effects.In the face of significant negative trends in the visual effects industry, principally the relocation of U.S. jobs to cheaper labor markets, Textor believed it necessary to expand the business into film production, content ownership and new media. In 2009, Digital Domain invested heavily, along with government funded grants, to train a workforce in Florida that was intended to reduce domestic costs, create new domestic jobs and launch the content development business. In 2011, Digital Domain Media Group entered into the film production business with a major investment into the feature film Ender's Game. Textor is credited as Producer and Executive Producer on the film.Textor's team of artists organized the 2012 appearance of Virtual Tupac Shakur at the Coachella Valley Music Festival.

The performance ultimately earned Textor's studio the Titanium Award at the 59th annual Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.Textor himself is no stranger to controversy as he experienced a high-profile business failure in 2012 when Digital Domain, one of Hollywood's most decorated visual effects specialists, became the subject of a hostile restructuring, led by Textor's once-friendly hedge fund investors. Textor lost control of his company, only to see its U.S. operations restructured through bankruptcy and relaunched through a $3.5 billion IPO in Hong Kong. Textor's personally launched Florida studio was shut down, hundreds of his employees lost their jobs and Textor and his fellow directors, such as John Sculley faced numerous lawsuits related to the shutdown.
He has never denied making mistakes with the business but Textor was cleared of any financial wrongdoing by the courts and the state of Florida's Inspector General, and he later received more than £6 million in a settlement  with the hedge funds that were eventually found to have really caused Digital Domain's collapse.
In the resolution of all disputed matters between the Digital Domain interested parties, including the state of Florida, Textor was awarded $8.5 million in financial damages and also assigned all technology assets of Digital Domain's Florida studio. SEC filings demonstrate that Textor used the award of these technology assets to launch the business that would ultimately become fuboTV.Since then, he has rebuilt his reputation and wealth. In 2013, he launched Facebank, “a technology-driven intellectual property company engaged in the development and promotion of human likeness technologies”, and, in 2020, it bought sports streaming platform fuboTV, merging the two businesses before floating them on the New York Stock Exchange as FuboTV Inc.

Pulse Evolution first showcased its technology with the holographic performance of Virtual Michael Jackson at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards, generating more than 100 million YouTube views and 98 billion Internet impressions worldwide.
