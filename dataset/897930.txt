Lars "Lasse" Nils Berghagen (born 13 May 1945) is a Swedish singer, songwriter and actor.
Berghagen is a well known singer-songwriter in Sweden. He released his first record in 1965, aged just 19. Four years later, in 1969, he released the single Teddybjörnen Fredriksson ("The Teddybear Fredriksson"), which has become a classic. Other hits include Sträck ut din hand, En kväll i juni and Stockholm i mitt hjärta.
Berghagen won the Swedish 1975 Melodifestivalen with the song Jennie, Jennie. He also participated in Melodifestivalen 1974 with the song Min kärlekssång till dig ("My Lovesong For You"), taking second place (after ABBA).He hosted the popular summer TV show Allsång på Skansen (Singalong at Skansen) from 1994 to 2003. During his time as host the show increased its ratings from 600,000 to 2,000,000 viewers, which by Swedish standards is considered an impressive rating (Sweden has approximately 10,000,000 inhabitants).
He was married to singer Barbro "Lill-Babs" Svensson from 1965 to 1968. He is the father of actress and TV personality Malin Berghagen, and the ex father-in-law of Tommy Nilsson.
