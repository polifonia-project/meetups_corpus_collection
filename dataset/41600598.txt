He would also go on to produce for Dynamite MC and Doom Man.Chue has remixed tracks by Destiny's Child, Public Enemy and Nas, among others. In the late 1990s, the 'Wookie sound' became apparent in his bootleg mixes of songs by Whitney Houston, Brandy and Debelah Morgan.
One of the original innovators of UK garage, Wookie scored a huge underground club hit in 1999 with "Scrappy". Also in that year, he released his first official remix of the Gabrielle song "Sunshine", under the name 'Wookie'. Another hit remix was released in 2000 under the alias Exemen, of Sia's song "Little Man". Wookie scored his first UK top 10 hit single in 2000 with "Battle".
