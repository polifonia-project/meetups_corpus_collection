== Career ==
Whitehorn began his professional career while managing and playing lead guitar for Shane Avery. Shortly after September 11th, he and Avery co-wrote "Song of America" and released the song to radio stations and select retailers in order to raise money for the families of fallen fire and police officers of New York City. Soon after Jason departed from the relationship managing Avery, he began a solo career of his own. He wrote "Knock, Knock" and "Prisoner of My Mind".


== Music ==
In his earlier years Whitehorn's music was rooted deeply in country, but in mid-2008 he began developing as a contemporary Christian artist and departing from some of the more traditional "pop-style" country that his fans had been more accustomed to.  Now, Jason is concentrating more on honing his skills as a songwriter instead of being merely an entertainer. Jason writes and releases songs for the church community that garner moderate crossover into the commercial radio world with releases of songs like "Never Alone."
