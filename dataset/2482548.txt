Ron Bushy (December 23, 1941 – August 29, 2021) was an American drummer best known as a member of the rock band Iron Butterfly and as the drum soloist on the band's iconic song "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida," released in 1968. He was the only member of the group to appear on all six of its studio albums.

=== Iron Butterfly ===
Previously playing in a band called the Voxmen, Bushy joined Iron Butterfly in 1966, following the band's relocation from San Diego to Los Angeles, replacing previous drummer Bruce Morse when he left due to a family emergency. Bushy became part of the group's classic lineup, along with vocalist and keyboardist Doug Ingle, guitarist Erik Brann, and bassist Lee Dorman.
After drumming on Iron Butterfly's first album Heavy in 1968, the band experienced substantial success with their song "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" from its second album, which shared the name, in which he played a lengthy and critically acclaimed drum solo. Bushy continued to play with Iron Butterfly on its third and fourth albums, 1969's Ball and 1970's Metamorphosis, until its break-up in 1971. He rejoined the group when the band reformed in 1974, playing on its fifth and sixth albums, Scorching Beauty and Sun and Steel, both released in 1975. He departed the group in 1977, and rejoined the next year.
Bushy continued to drum for Iron Butterfly on-and-off until its second break-up, in 1985. From Iron Butterfly's second reunion in 1987, he continued to drum with the group on-and-off as the most consistent member throughout various other member changes and break-ups.
