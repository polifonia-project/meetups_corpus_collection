=== Pre-debut ===

Jeongyeon failed an audition to join JYP Entertainment as a child, but eventually joined after passing an open audition in March 2010. She trained for five years before her debut with Twice. From 2013 to early 2015, it was expected that Jeongyeon would become a member of a new JYP girl group alongside current Twice members Nayeon, Sana, and Jihyo. However, this project was cancelled and in the end they did not debut. In 2015, Jeongyeon competed in the television program  Sixteen, a reality television competition designed to select the founding members of Twice. In the final episode, she was chosen as one of the nine winners who went on to form Twice.

Since Jeongyeon's debut, she has also served as the songwriter for some of Twice's tracks. In Gallup Korea's annual music poll, Jeongyeon was voted among the top 20 most popular idols in South Korea for four consecutive years from 2016 to 2019, alongside her bandmate Nayeon.
