Born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Eardley first started on trumpet at the age of 11; his father played in Paul Whiteman's orchestra. From 1946 to 1949 Eardley played in an Air Force band in Washington, D.C., then led with his own quartet in D.C. from 1950 to 1953.
He moved to New York City in 1953, playing with Phil Woods (1954), Gerry Mulligan (1954–57), and Hal McIntyre (1956). Following this he returned to his hometown and played there until 1963, when he moved to Belgium.
