George Tyndall Tickner (born September 8, 1946 in Syracuse, New York) is an American rock musician who played rhythm guitar and co-wrote songs as a founding member of Journey.
Prior to joining Journey, Tickner was a member of the San Francisco psychedelic rock band Frumious Bandersnatch, along with fellow Journey founder Ross Valory.In 1973, Tickner was in the lineup for a number of performances by Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders' band.After the release of Journey's debut album, he left the band to attend Stanford Medical School on a full scholarship.
