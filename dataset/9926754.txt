== Career ==


=== The J. Geils Band ===
Salwitz's harmonica playing became a major and distinctive element in the J. Geils Band's sound during their hard-rocking 1970s heyday. His performance of "Whammer Jammer" on the band's live album Full House has been particularly noted. In The Rolling Stone Record Guide (1979), music critic Dave Marsh described Salwitz as possibly "the best white musician to ever play blues harmonica." He was often referred to as "Magic Dick and his Lickin' Stick".After the J. Geils Band dissolved in 1985, Salwitz spent time working on a harmonica design of his own, the "Magic Harmonica", for which he received a patent with co-inventor Pierre Beauregard. Beauregard was the director of the Cambridge Harmonica Orchestra, of which Salwitz was also a member.


=== Bluestime ===
In 1992, Salwitz reunited with his old friend and bandmate J. Geils and formed the band Bluestime, with Steve Ramsey on drums, Jerry Miller on guitar, and Roy McCloud on bass. McCloud was later replaced by Michael "Mudcat" Ward, who played with the band for several years before leaving to pursue other interests. Ward was subsequently replaced by bassist John Turner. Steve Ramsey left the band in 2000 and was replaced by Gordon Grottenthaller on drums until the band's final show on New Year's Eve 2004 at the Bullrun in Shirley, MA. The band's music was a fusion of Chicago blues and classic jazz.
The band released two records on the Rounder Records label: Bluestime (1994) and Little Car Blues (1996). They toured heavily through 2002, and played a handful of shows in 2003 as both a solo act and as part of B.B. King's Bluesfest. They played only 1 show in 2004 on New Year's Eve which was their final show.


=== Additional blues music ===
Salwitz contributed his harmonica playing and some vocals to a live recording, "Command Performance", by the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue, featuring the Tommy Castro Band, Deanna Bogart, Ronnie Baker Brooks, and others. He toured as part of the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue on different blues cruises and again on land-based shows during 2007 through 2008.In 2014, Salwitz began collaborating with guitarist and vocalist Shun Ng. "Immediately taken by his arranging, his composing and more particularly by his performance", Salwitz formed a friendship with Shun, who was born in Chicago, raised in Singapore, and based in Boston. They formed an acoustic duo and perform and record music together regularly. They have toured together as part of the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue, with artists such as Buddy Guy, Irma Thomas and Allen Toussaint.
