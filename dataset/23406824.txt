== Personal life and hardship ==
Chambers has reported that despite the group's success, he did not receive any royalty payments from 1967 to 1994. In a chat session on the Soul Patrol website, he discussed such injustices that many black artists have endured.In 2002 his wife, Lola Chambers, testified before the California Senate hearings on Label Accounting Practices that "Time Has Come Today" earned the group under $250 in royalties for the European market over 16 years.  She said that Columbia Records told them that "there were no overseas sales to report because The Chambers Brothers records were never licensed to an overseas distributor".  But she later discovered copies on eBay of numerous foreign pressings of their records on Columbia foreign affiliate labels for which they were not compensated.In 2003, the home of Lola and Lester Chambers was broken into and their record collection, consisting of over sixty Chambers Brothers albums and over one hundred singles, was stolen.  Lola Chambers had spent twenty five years collecting Chambers Brothers records at various venues to leave these for their sons.  Lester Chambers developed a number of medical problems that went untreated because he lacked insurance.  He later became homeless, sleeping in a rehearsal hall in Novato, California, until Yoko Ono paid to rent a home for him and his son Dylan.In March 2012 Lester started an Internet campaign that went viral to publicize what he claims to be a lack of equitable royalty payments.  His Facebook posting received over 2,500 "likes" and over 2,000 "shares" in the first 15 hours on his "Wall"; it was featured on the front page of Reddit and there were hundreds of tweets about the story.
On July 13, 2013 Lester Chambers was assaulted onstage during a performance at the Russell City Hayward Blues Festival after dedicating a performance of "People Get Ready" to Trayvon Martin, the day the jury found his killer not guilty of a criminal offense. He was reported by his son Dylan to be in "ok" condition later the same evening.Chambers is a resident of Petaluma, California.
