== Personal life ==


=== Relationships ===
In April 2017, it was confirmed by Park's agency that he was engaged to Hwang Ha-na. On May 15, 2018, the couple was reported to have ended their relationship.


=== Legal issues and controversies ===
In 2016 and 2017, Yoo-chun was accused by four different women of sexual assault, but was acquitted after the police ruled it was difficult to prove the use of force, making the charges invalid. The case was later forwarded to Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office and he was also cleared of all sexual assault charges.  One of Yoo-chun's accusers was ruled to have falsified the charges, and was sentenced to two years in prison. In 2017, another one of Yoo-chun's accusers ("A") was found to be not guilty of false accusations and defamation. The prosecutor of this defamation case attempted to appeal this decision but the appeal was denied. In 2018, "A" filed for a civil suit for damages against Yoo-chun for 100 million won in compensation and requested for his officetel to be seized.  The court has ordered to settle their suit through mandatory mediation with the Seoul Court Mediation Center  ruling in July 2019 that Yoo-chun should pay "A" 50 million won instead. Because Park Yoo-Chun did not send his objection to the proposal within the given two weeks deadline the terms are accepted by default and solidified the amount he must compensate.  Yoo-chun initially failed to pay the compensation, and was brought to a detention judgement trial in 2020. During the trial, Yoo-chun was given a "non-punishment" ruling, meaning "the punishment is unfair or that the debtor proved that he was meeting his obligations by the date of the trial". In February of 2021, it was announced that Yoo-chun had paid the compensation in full.On August 18, 2021, it was reported in a Japanese news article that Park had signed with a new agency due to his former agency (Re:Cielo) having "barely paid" him during his two years with the company, and claimed the company had embezzled funds. In response, Re:Cielo announced that Park's statements were entirely false and that they were preparing a civil damages lawsuit against him due to his breach of contract and defamation of the company. On August 27, 2021 another agency Yespera Co., Ltd revealed that Re:Cielo signed an exclusive contract that grants Yespera exclusive management rights of Park Yoochun with permission from the artist. For this reason, they filed an injuction against his broadcast and entertainment activities stating there was no reason to terminate his contract. On November 10, 2021, Park was temporarily banned from appearing on TV and continuing any activities in the entertainment industry (unless the activities were with Yesperar but no mention of Re:Cielo) by the Seoul Central District Court. 


=== Drug use allegations and related charges ===
On April 26, 2019, Park was arrested on suspicion of purchasing and using methamphetamine. He was also suspected of attempting to destroy evidence by dyeing and shaving the hair from his body before undergoing the drug test. Park's agency, C-JeS Entertainment, announced that his contract would be terminated and that he would retire from the industry. According to news reports, Park admitted the drug charges against him after initially having repeatedly denied the accusations. On July 2, 2019, Park was sentenced to ten months imprisonment, suspended for two years and a fine of 1.4 million won. He has since completed his probation without violations.
