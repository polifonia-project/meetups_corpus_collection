== History ==
Born in Matlock, Derbyshire, Charles Webster grew up in the Peak District. His father was an artist and his mother (in his own words) "just worked at whatever she felt like at the time", and his parents' record collection was an early influence, Webster stating that "it was when they got into Kraftwerk that I decided to become a musician". He got his first instruments at age 13 (guitar, synthesizer, and drum machine). He studied art in Derby before moving to Nottingham where he began playing in electronic bands (including Mile High Club) and started working in a restaurant – the owner of which also just happened to own the city's 'Garage Club', where he began performing.Webster worked with US artists such as Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson through his job as a recording engineer at Square Dance studios in Derby, and moved to San Francisco in 1992 where he started the Love From San Francisco label. This led to his music being released on other US labels.
Back in the UK in 1996, Webster started the Remote label. The All Systems Gone album, released in 1999 and credited to the ensemble Presence, which featured singers Shara Nelson, Sara Jay, and Steve Edwards, was described by Webster as "a collection of songs for the clubs and the home", and included the singles "Sense of Danger" (featuring Nelson), "Future Love", and "Better Day". The album was well received by critics, garnering an 11/10 rating from DJ magazine, and described by Allmusic as "Probably the first classic record of the 21st century."Born on the 24th of July (Peacefrog Records) was recorded over an 18-month period between 1999 and 2000, and released in 2001, featuring contributions from Terra Deva, and Massive Attack vocalist Sara Jay. A remixed version of Born on the 24th of July was released in late 2003, featuring mixes by several Peacefrog label artists. After five years of touring and production, 2007 saw the release of a definitive three-disc Webster compilation project on Defected Records, followed in 2008 by a Coast 2 Coast compilation for NRK Records and Strictly Rhythms Vol. 4.
2013 saw the release of two albums from Webster — a retrospective compilation on Defected called House Masters: Charles Webster, and a modern big band jazz album with Pete Wraight (as the Wraight-Webster Ensemble), No Lucky Days.He has been working on his album 2021 we are all still waiting for when the album go drop
