From the 1970s onwards,  he performed primarily within the context of free jazz, spending some of this period studying with Yusef Lateef.In the early 1990s, Campbell moved to the Netherlands and performed regularly with Klaas Hekman and Don Cherry. In addition to leading his own groups, he performed with Yo La Tengo, William Parker, Peter Brötzmann, Matthew Shipp, and other improvisors. Upon returning to the United States he began leading his group Other Dimensions In Music and also formed the Pyramid Trio, a pianoless trio formed with William Parker.He died in January 2014 of hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at the age of 61.
