Paula Mitrache (born June 14, 1977), known by the stage name Haiducii (Romanian pronunciation: [hajˈdutʃij]), is a Romanian-Italian singer, model and actress. She released her debut single "Dragostea din tei" in 2004, acting as a cover of O-Zone's homonymous 2003 single. A copyright infringement lawsuit followed on the matter and resulted in Haiducii paying fees for copyright infringement. Commercially, "Dragostea din tei" reached widespread commercial success, reaching number one in Austria, Italy, Portugal and Sweden, as well as the top ten in eight other countries. It was also certified Gold and Platinum in several territories. In late 2004 and 2005, Haiducii released "Mne s Toboy Horosho" and "More 'N' More (I Love You)", her last singles that managed to chart on a record chart, reaching numbers five and eight in Italy, respectively. Paula Mitrache in Haiducii, the singer's debut studio album, followed in 2008.
