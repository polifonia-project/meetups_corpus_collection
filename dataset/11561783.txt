David G. Walker is a British pianist, singer and composer (born 1946) based in London and sometime Victoria, Australia, known for his distinctive performances of rock and roll classics, original songs and church worship songs.   


== Biography ==
Walker grew up in Stamford, Lincolnshire, England, attending Stamford School.  His first live performance was at the local Methodist youth club with trumpeter Ian Starsmore.  Then, with guitarist Peter Banks, fronting the 'Slendermen' at school dances, their first major concert in December 1964 included a song by Sam Cooke, during which news came on the radio of Cooke's murder in Los Angeles.While studying at university and qualifying as a secondary schoolteacher, Walker became a church organist, wrote a number of choral settings and chants, dabbled in folk with a residency at King's Lynn Folk Club, and led several small bands (Shades of Harmony, Tristars, Millionaires).  He made his first pop singles for independent labels, including 'GCE for Love', 'First Class Faker' and 'Jane', collaborating with Parisian songwriter Nicolas Bensaid.  Teaching in Victoria, Australia, Walker continued writing and performing across the state with rock group 'Apollo 5', led by guitarist Geoff Stobie.
Back in the UK, Walker continues to perform at hundreds of venues and to write and record his own music and others' material, and collaborates on musical shows with author George Taylor. The album Is That Your Picture?, for instance, features new songs alongside old music hall and show favourites.


== Collaborations ==
Walker currently performs solo and with bands mainly around London and the Home Counties.  His albums Daylight, Go with the Flow and So Many Sunlit Days include collaborations with guitarist-producer Rob Marshall and Australians Nicky Del Rey (Slow Town Social Club, Jack Howard & the Long Lost Brothers, Actual Reality), Lisa Miller, Mark Ferrie (The Models, Actual Reality), Graham Lee (The Triffids) and Tony Thornton.
