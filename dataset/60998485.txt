== Notable projects and videos ==

Stauber's most famous work, "Buttercup", is the opening song released on his 2017 album Pop Food. The song, along with remixes and covers of it, became a popular internet meme, especially on TikTok, which contributed substantially to its success. The song had 323 million Spotify streams as of January 2022. Stauber did not release an official music video for "Buttercup". The song has been described as "bubbly, dramatic pop with Panda Bear-esque vocals." YouTuber lisuga made a popular fan made video using clips from the Japanese short film, "Kick-Heart".

"Oh Klahoma", the second track from Pop Food, also became popular. The song had 109 million Spotify streams as of January 2022. The song is most famously used as background music to a TikTok trend called #ghostphotoshoot, where creators dress up as ghosts and take photos of themselves, sometimes wearing sunglasses and other fashion accessories.

=== Adult Swim ===
Stauber has done multiple projects for Adult Swim. These projects have all done extremely well on YouTube and Adult Swim, getting millions of views.


==== Wishing Apple and Valentine's Day is Not for the Lonely ====
The first short Stauber created for Adult Swim was called "Wishing Apple," a short released on July 3, 2018 on the Adult Swim YouTube channel.The next was "Valentine's Day is Not for the Lonely," which premiered on Off The Air's season eight episode "Love" on August 28, 2018. However, the short was created and released on Valentine's Day, almost 6 months before the short was released on Adult Swim, on February 14, 2018. The video was also shortened for its Adult Swim premiere.


==== SHOP: A Pop Opera ====
Nearly a year after "Valentine's Day is Not for the Lonely" was created, the surreal musical comedy  SHOP: A Pop Opera premiered on Adult Swim in March 2019. The series utilizes mixed media, incorporated clay animation, music, and VHS-like filters. The six-part series aired each episode at midnight from March 4 to March 9. The episodes were also uploaded onto YouTube the next day. A year later, Stauber released the soundtrack for the miniseries on March 8, after someone hacked into his account and fraudulently uploaded the soundtrack in October of the previous year. On November 4, 2020, the full series was uploaded onto the Adult Swim YouTube channel.The series centers on an unnamed man, nicknamed Jeff by the community, who goes shopping at the grocery store. With each object on his list, he encounters individuals who are engrossed in a personal habit or dilemma, while also vaguely resembling the thing he is shopping for. After being dissatisfied with picking a random pound of cheese, he overcomes his indecisiveness and goes to try a sample of yogurt he was mulling over previously.


==== Jack Stauber's OPAL ====
The latest Adult Swim project created by Stauber is a short surreal musical psychological horror film, entitled Jack Stauber's OPAL, which premiered on October 31, 2020. The same day, OPAL was also released on the Adult Swim YouTube channel. Stauber also received help from the producers at Williams Street for the creation of OPAL. The series utilizes stop-motion, 3D-animated, and live action segments.The short centers on a girl named Opal who lives with her kind and caring family. They tell her to stay away from a creepy house from across the street, but her curiosity gets the best of her and she finds herself trapped in the dark house. She meets the inhabitants, an old man who smokes and watches TV, a conceited man who talks about his looks, and a woman who drinks and blames others for her problems. All of them refer to Opal as "Claire" and chase her into the attic where she locks the door. Opal looks out the window to find that instead of her house, there is a billboard for "Opal's Burgers", implying that she is in fact Claire and that her kind family were the result of her mentally running away from her real life. She once again succumbs to her fantasy life as her real family attempt to break down her door.


== Style ==

Meg Fair of Pittsburgh City Paper highlighted Stauber's knack of "pulling unrelated sounds and influences into [his] music, throwing them into a bowl and tossing them into a strange salad that challenges your musical taste buds." Jenna Minnig of PennState CommMedia compared Stauber's music to Ariel Pink's; as both have hypnagogic-pop styles and have similar voices, but believed it was unnecessary and reductionary to compare the two. Knoxville News Sentinel's Chuck Campbell described Stauber's music videos as "nostalgic and childlike, but there’s also something disturbingly adult about them, the kind of thing that might have surfaced on Pee-wee's Playhouse back in the day."


=== Music ===
Stauber is well known for his hypnagogic pop, avant-pop, and synth-pop music. Stauber's unique vocal effects are developed in the shower, and are inspired by Donovan in his song "Hurdy Gurdy Man". Stauber also collects objects to create sounds to use in songs, and has a drawer filled with "various noise-makers" he has collected. Stauber uses the Plopscotch Records label to enlist copyright on his music.
Artists that have expressed admiration for Stauber's music include rock musician Jon Bon Jovi, comedian Andy Milonakis, actor Verne Troyer, indie singer-songwriter Sidney Gish, and model Paris Jackson.


=== Videos ===
Stauber's videos are mainly animations, which are usually made with MS Paint and claymation. He usually does all of the voices for his animations, and he records the dialogue with a small idea of what his characters may look like. His videos are usually separated into three styles: "surreal", characters with odd and striking facial expressions and frequently part of his claymations, "colorful", which are usually featured in his VHS animations and music videos, and "Stauber faces", light-skinned characters with cartoon noses. Stauber is also well known for his frequent use of teeth in his videos and animations. He usually uses detailed resin teeth on his clay characters, although he has used real teeth. He has encouraged fans to send him teeth for him to use in his videos.Stauber is well known for his signature "created by Jack Stauber" title card. These are featured at the end of his videos, and have been used since 2017.
To create his animations, Stauber uses Microsoft Paint for the drawings. He then sequences the frames in Adobe Premiere Pro, and then runs the finished video through a VHS tape.
