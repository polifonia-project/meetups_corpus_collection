DJ Signify is an underground hip hop producer from Brooklyn, New York.


== History ==
DJ Signify's first album Sleep No More, featuring collaborations with Sage Francis and Buck 65, was described as "hip-hop at its darkest and most chilling" and earned him accolades as a "master beatsmith." His second album Of Cities was similarly described as "dense, bleak instrumental hip-hop," reminiscent of Burial's Untrue and Tricky's Maxinquaye.
