Markquez Lao Santiago (born April 11, 1988), known professionally as Kid Buu is a rapper and singer based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. His career has been marked by his attempts to generate controversy, including claims of being a second generation clone created by the Bahamian company Clonaid.


== Early life ==
Santiago was born on April 11, 1988, at St. Elizabeth Child Care Center in Jersey City, New Jersey. He later moved with his fraternal twin brother, Jason, and his mother to South Florida, specifically the Hialeah and Opa-locka areas, in search of a better life. As a child, Santiago took martial arts classes. He attended public school before being home-schooled. He recalls the death of friends in harsh neighborhoods as well as having little food as motivators for a better life. He is of Sicilian and Puerto Rican descent.


== Personal life ==
Prior to his rap career, Santiago had been cited for child abuse in 2008. Santiago was arrested when he was 19 after he got into a fight with his then-underage girlfriend. She was also the mother of their child, who was only two years old when the incident occurred. The pair eventually got violent, and Santiago punched her in the face while their child was present. He denied these claims, but pleaded guilty to child and animal abuse, intimidation, robbery, and criminal mischief. He was sentenced to two years of probation.In late 2017, Santiago changed his stage name from "Humongous The God" to "Kid Buu", in reference to his favorite Dragon Ball Z character, and for his love of anime. The "Majin" tattoo between his eyes, his fangs and his pink hair further promote this persona.Kid Buu is a Raëlian. Kid Buu also hosts a vlog on YouTube eponymously named "Life of Buu" in which he shows off his luxurious lifestyle.
