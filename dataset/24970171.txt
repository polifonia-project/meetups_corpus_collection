For their second album, 1991's The Hangman Tree, former Sepultura guitarist Jairo Guedz took over full guitar duties for the band, reducing the band to a four-piece whilst further expanding the unique sound of the debut. Vocalist Korg left after the second album, further reducing the line-up to a trio for which Marcelo took over vocal duties for their third album, Ashes To Ashes, Dust To Dust released in 1993 which showed the band adopting a more contemporary groove-metal sound. Following this release, Marcelo left the band and was replaced by Cassiano Gobbet on both bass and vocals for their final album, 1995's Gottverlassen before splitting in 1997.
