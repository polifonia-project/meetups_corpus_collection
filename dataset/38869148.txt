Harry Blons (né Harry Raymond Yblonski; 29 November 1911 Saint Paul, Minnesota  — 20 July 1987 Minneapolis, Minnesota) was an American jazz clarinetist from Minnesota.  He performed with the touring groups of Hal McIntyre, Red Nichols, and Red Dougherty.  He had performed with jazz combos in Saint Paul and Minneapolis.


== Career ==
At the end of the 1940s, Blons began fronting his own group and playing in the Dixieland style. In 1954 he was featured on both clarinet and tenor sax in the Doc Evans combo, not abandoning the Harry Blons Six as the group remained active in the mid-1950s. Blons continued to be associated with his native St. Paul. While much of his group's recorded output is out of print, various live recordings done in Minnesota when stars such as Bunk Johnson and Don Ewell came through town remain in circulation. His recordings as a leader include the excellent Singin' the Blues, originally released by Mercury Records. Blons also created vinyl product for the Zephyr, Audio Fidelity, and Audiophile Records labels.
