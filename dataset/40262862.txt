The band originally consisted of Jason Boudreau and George Glasco (guitarists and founders of the band), Chadd Castor (vocals), Josh Luebbers (bassist), Mike Rice (drums) and Jeff Janeczko (keyboards). They released two demos from 1993-1995 before releasing their debut album through an indie label in 1997. In 1999, they signed with Metal Blade and their debut album was re-released that same year. Their debut album was reminiscent to the early 1990s sound of the metal band Fates Warning. After a couple of years, Castor, Luebbers and Janeczko left the band. They were replaced with Graeme Wood (keyboards), Rob Munshower (bass) and Pete Jewell (vocals).In 2000, they released their second album, Reconceive. The album showed a departure in sound, moving forward more into a Speed Metal sound. The album was heavier than their debut.After their second album, they released a demo in 2002. Following the demo, the band disbanded. Pete Jewell committed suicide in 2005.Boudreau formed a band called Negative Four following TQR's disbandment. Negative Four lasted two years with an album recorded but not released in 2004. In 2005 they disbanded.
