Thomas Snodham was an English printer.  He was a specialist music printer, but music accounted for as little as 10 per cent of the books he printed. His other output included plays.

Snodham was the son of a draper.
In 1595 he was apprenticed to his uncle, the printer Thomas East.  East specialised in music printing and printed works by well-known composers such as William Byrd and John Dowland. Snodham became a freeman of the Stationers Company in 1602. He printed his first book the following year, King James his entertainment at Theobalds, which was sold from EastÂ´s premises.When East died in 1608, his will made provision for the financial security of his widow Lucretia, she inherited a number of music books, some of which Snodham was to acquire from her. The will also made clear that East wanted Snodham to take over the business.  Snodham acquired East's printing equipment, and he himself became an important music printer. Snodham printed works by some composers associated with East, such as John Wilbye. For a while, the business continued to use the old name; for example, the second set of Wilbye's 'Madrigals' (1609) is stated to be printed by "Thomas East, alias Snodham".
