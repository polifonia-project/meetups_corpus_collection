Ray Warleigh was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, and migrated to  England in 1960, where he quickly established himself as an in-demand session musician.He played and recorded with major figures and bands of the UK jazz and blues scene, including Alexis Korner, Tubby Hayes, Humphrey Lyttelton, Terry Smith, Ronnie Scott, Long John Baldry, John Mayall, Keef Hartley, Allan Holdsworth, Soft Machine, Georgie Fame, Mike Westbrook, Dick Morrissey and Kenny Wheeler, as well as Mike Oldfield,  Nick Drake, and Charlie Watts. He accompanied visiting artists such as Champion Jack Dupree.

Warleigh's last album, Rue Victor Massé (2009), is an improvisation with free-jazz drummer Tony Marsh, has received critical acclaim. According to Jazz Review: "The duo’s synergy and common goals resound mightily here. Featuring Warleigh’s lyrically resplendent sax and flute lines, in concert with a crystalline audio sound, the musicians flex some muscle amid buoyant underpinnings."In 1973 he joined Latin fusion band Paz, led by vibist and composer Dick Crouch.
