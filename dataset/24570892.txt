Charles Gocher Jr. (November 12, 1952 â€“ February 19, 2007) was an American musician, writer and visual artist, most famous for being a founding member, lyricist and drummer of the experimental rock group Sun City Girls. He also released Pint Sized Spartacus, a solo album under his own name, in 1997. Charles lost his long battle with cancer on February 19, 2007 in Seattle, aged 54. The two other members of Sun City Girls, brothers Alan and Richard Bishop, embarked on a tour of the United States and Canada called "The Brothers Unconnected" in tribute to Charles' death, featuring showings of the man's video works and stripped-down, acoustic versions of selected Sun City Girls songs, including several tracks written by Gocher himself.
