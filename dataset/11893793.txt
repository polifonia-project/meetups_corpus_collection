This list includes those who have acted as presenters of the Eurovision Song Contest, since the competition's inception in 1956. From 1988, it has been the norm to have two presenters for the contest. All contests before 1978 have had one presenter, and only a few after 1988 have had only one presenter (these being in 1993, 1995 and 2013). The 1999 contest was the first to consist of three presenters in one contest, and this method has been used most often since 2010. The contests from 2018 to 2021 consisted of four presenters each (excluding the cancelled 2020 contest).

== Running order and allocation draw presenters ==
Prior to each year's contest, a series of draws have been held to determine differing facets of the contest's production, which typically are presided by one or more presenters. Historically a random drawing of lots was held prior to each year's contest to determine the order in which participating countries would perform in the grand final, and since 2004 in the semi-finals; this was abolished in 2013, when the running order began to be determined by the contest producers.A semi-final allocation draw has been held since 2008, to determine which countries perform in which of the two semi-finals, as well as in which semi-final the automatic finalists have voting rights. The semi-finalist countries are divided into pots based on historic voting patterns, and countries in each pot are then split equally between the two semi-finals. During this draw the countries are also assigned to perform in either the first or second half of the show; the exact running order is then determined at a later date.
