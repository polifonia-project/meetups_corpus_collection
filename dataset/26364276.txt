He has a successful career with Kumbia All Starz, performing songs such as "Mami" “Rica y Apretadita" and "Por Ti Baby." The singer-songwriter Ricky commenced his musical profession when a friend introduced him to A.B. Quintanilla who at the time was auditioning members for a new musical concept.

== Early life ==
Born Ricardo Ruiz Pérez on June 3, 1983, and raised in his native Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. His inclination for music developed at an early age. Having been exposed to all the positive aspects of being bicultural, he would spend a vast majority of his childhood with his Panamanian Dad listening to Salsa, Soca and to the Reggae music of El General, Nando Boom and various other musical exponents prevalent at that time in the country. That led him to experiment fluidly with sounds and discover through the years his own musical abilities. At the age of 3, he and his friend, producer and guitarist Reynold Martinez, began dabbling in music. At 10 he picked up the guitar and at 15, back in Monterrey, Ricky Rick started performing with various local bands. At 17 he learned to play percussion and drums and continued singing and performing, all the while working towards obtaining his bachelor's degree in business from the Universidad Regiomontana de Monterrey.


== Career ==
The singer-songwriter Ricky commenced his musical profession when a friend introduced him to A.B. Quintanilla who at the time was auditioning members for a new musical concept. Barely two days after a brief telephone audition, A.B. flew him to Texas to start recording the songs that would then become megahits for the band. After spending 4 years travelling the world, playing sold-out shows and collaborating with many great musical minds including A.B., Melissa Jiménez on "Rica y Apretadita" and Flex on "Por Ti Baby" and "Besos de Amor", he decided it was time to venture out on his own and as such, teamed up with former Kumbia Kings lead singer, after the two discussed the idea while on a trip to Bolivia. The two had previously performed on stage together when they formed part of the Kumbia All Starz. " Ricky Rick's Debut solo album is said to be a fusion of urban and cumbia laced with electronic rhythms and will be released late 2018.
