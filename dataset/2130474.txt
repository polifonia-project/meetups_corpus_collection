== Career ==
Rauhofer was a popular DJ who spun throughout the United States. He was the former resident DJ at the weekly gay dance night held at the Roxy in New York, which closed its doors in 2007. Rauhofer was formerly the resident DJ of the gay dance party called "Work". His party was held weekly at the Stereo nightclub in New York until March 3, 2008 when the City invoked eminent domain and acquired the building. "Work" was a monthly event, despite lacking a permanent venue.
Rauhofer was mostly known for spinning tribal house and continued to play many gay circuit party events, and was scheduled to play the ultimate events (White Party Palm Springs and One Mighty Weekend's Magic Journeys at Arabian Nights) prior to his falling ill in February 2013.
Memorial services were held from coast to coast (including Miami and New York) and special events honoring Rauhofer continued into the Summer of 2013.
