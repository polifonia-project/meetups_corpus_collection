== Early life and education ==

== Career ==
The comedy album boom of the early 1960s was a significant influence, particularly Allan Sherman's My Son, The Folksinger. He started playing guitar at ten, and played in cover bands in his early teens. Working at the Waxie Maxie's Record Store helped broaden his taste, discovering the blues, as well as jazz and gospel. Wirtz developed a friendship with blues pianist Sunnyland Slim who invited him to Chicago in June 1979.
He began his career as a solo artist in 1981. In 1982, he recorded his first album, Salvation Through Polyester, on No Big Deal Records. His song "Teenie Weenie Meanie", described as "a tasteful vignette about a midget lady wrestler" led to a six-month-long contract as a "Manager" with Professional Wrestling From Florida (PWF). While there he worked with Dennis "Mideon" Knight, The Nasty Boys, Gigolo Jimmy Backlund, and Dallas Page. Twelve years later, he returned to professional wrestling with a three-month stint on WTBS Monday Nitro.
The Nashville Network, USA Network and NBC have showcased Wirtz's talents, along with nationwide morning radio shows.  Similarly, "Waffle House Fire" has been featured on XM Radio's Channel 151, Laugh USA.  Wirtz performs concerts and teaches workshops on blues and gospel music.
In 1990, his album Backslider's Tractor Pull won an award for Comedy Album of the Year by the National Association of Independent Record Distributors. Found on that album is his parody about the Waffle House restaurant chain. On his album Unchained Maladies (1998), he covered Tom Lehrer's "I Hold Your Hand In Mine".
He created a humorous church known as The First House Of Polyester Worship and Horizontal Throbbing Teenage Desire, and Our Lady of the White Go-Go Boot, Lord of the 40-Watt Undulating Bubbling Lava Lamp Apocalyptic, No Pizza Take-Out After Twelve, Shrine Of The Rick Flair ‘WOOOO’, Rasslin' Jeezus.
In 2008, Circumstantial Productions published Wirtz's first book, Sermons & Songs, edited by Richard Connolly. In September 2012, Wirtz published his second book, Red Headed Geek, with Holy Macro Books.
