=== The Voice ===
Evans appeared on the second season of NBC's The Voice. In the blind audition broadcast on February 20, 2012, he sang "What's Going On" from Marvin Gaye. Only Christina Aguilera turned her chair during the blind audition, with the other three (Adam Levine, CeeLo Green and Blake Shelton) abstaining. On Team Aguilera as a default, he was put in the Battles round against another Aguilera contestant, Jesse Campbell. On an episode broadcast on March 5, they both sang the Alicia Keys song "If I Ain't Got You", with Aguilera opting to keep Campbell after an epic musical confrontation. The show hadn't installed the "steal option" for other judges yet, so Evans was eliminated from the show.


=== Real Life/Real Worship ===
After The Voice, Evans released his sixth studio album on April 8, 2014, called Real Life/Real Worship with Fair Trade Services. It proved to be commercially his most successful album release. The album charted on the Billboard on the week of April 26, 2014, at number 60 most sold album in all the United States by the Billboard Hot 200. The album made it also to number 4 on the Top Christian Album chart the same week. In addition, the album reached number 2 on the most sold Top Gospel Albums chart.
