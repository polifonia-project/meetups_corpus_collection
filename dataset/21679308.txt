In 1997 Badger's first one-man exhibition of recycled art titled Lost and Found was displayed in Warrington Museum, later shown in Bristol Museum 1998, and Leicester City Gallery in 1999. Also, in 1997 Badger created several tin sculptures for Liverpool band Space's album Tin Planet, and for their video of "Avenging Angels".

Badger appeared at the SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas, in 2009 and again in 2010, where he performed with local and international acts and featured on Country Music Radio USA.
