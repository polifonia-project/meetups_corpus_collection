=== 2013–15: G.R.L. ===
While talking to Billboard.com on the red carpet at the American Music Awards, Bennett confirmed herself as a part of the newly regrouped recording group. This made her the first member of a brand new line-up that creator Robin Antin confirmed to Billboard was in the process of being built. "We're currently figuring out who's in the group and we're working on an album," Bennett says of the new group, which at the time was slated to be the revamped Pussycat Dolls. In 2011 it was announced that a new line-up of the "sexy brand" would debut in February 2012 during a GoDaddy Super Bowl commercial. Bennett was featured and included in the original line-up along with Paula van Oppen and three others who were cut from the group for various reasons. Eventually, Simone Battle, Emmalyn Estrada, and Natasha Slayton joined and G.R.L. debuted their hit single "Vacation" on The Smurfs 2 soundtrack.
G.R.L. found international success and was featured with artists such as Pitbull on his hit single "Wild Wild Love". The group went on to release a self-titled EP, G.R.L., in which its lead single Ugly Heart peaked at 2 on the Australian charts. G.R.L. were on their way to mainstream success when group member Simone Battle died in September 2014. In January 2015, the group released a single in honor of Battle titled "Lighthouse", and dedicated themselves to raising awareness for mental health issues. On 2 June 2015, the group officially disbanded.

That's when this song was written. After seeing my mother suffer with mental struggles for years I then lost a friend to this. It has always affected my life in some way. We all at least know someone who has dealt with it or have yourself. This is a story to show from my eyes what it feels like to suffer from this but also the other perspective to lose someone to this." It was later announced on Twitter that a portion of the proceeds from the single would be donated to The Campaign to Change Direction, an organization dedicated to change the culture of mental health in America.On 15 June 2016, over a year after G.R.L. announced their breakup, it was reported that the group has plans to reform under new representation with UK based agency Loco Talent.
