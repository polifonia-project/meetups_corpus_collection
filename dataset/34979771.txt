== Biography ==
Tyler Farr grew up in Garden City, Missouri and attended Missouri State University with degree in voice.
Farr co-wrote the songs "Hey Y'all" for Cole Swindell and "She's Just Like That" for Joe Nichols. In early 2012, Farr released his debut single, "Hot Mess", which he co-wrote with Rhett Akins. Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song four stars out of five, calling Farr's voice "unique, but not distracting." Following the merger of his original label, BNA Records, Farr moved to Columbia Nashville  to release his second single, "Hello Goodbye". His third single, "Redneck Crazy", became his first Top 10 hit in 2013. After it came the top 3 hit "Whiskey in My Water". All four singles were included on his debut album, Redneck Crazy, which was released on September 30, 2013.
Farr led off his second album in mid-2014 with "A Guy Walks Into a Bar". The album, entitled Suffer in Peace, was released on April 28, 2015 and "A Guy Walks Into a Bar" became Farr's first No. 1 single on Billboard Country Airplay in May 2015. The album's second single, "Withdrawals" released to country radio on June 15, 2015. It had only reached number 52 on the Country Airplay chart before it was pulled from radio and "Better in Boots" was issued as a third single on August 17, 2015. The decision to change the single was made in order to give Farr an up-tempo, "female friendly" song that he could sing live, according to Steve Hodges of Sony Nashville."Our Town", Farr's eighth single release, was issued in late 2016. Singer Seth Ennis co-wrote the song.
In September 2018, Farr parted ways with Sony Music Nashville. Farr signed with Broken Bow Records in March 2019 under Jason Aldean's newly-founded imprint Night Train Records, and released the EP Only Truck in Town on June 5, 2020. The title track and "Soundtrack to a Small Town Sundown" were released as singles.
