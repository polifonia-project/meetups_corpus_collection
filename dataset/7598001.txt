== Life and career ==
Haliene was born in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on March 29, 1988, to pianist Jeffrey Howard Sweet and artist Candace Lynn Sweet. Born into a musical household, she was raised on the jazz standards that were part of her father's repertoire. Soon after she could walk, Haliene learned musical notes with her father's help. Her first public performance followed when she was four years old at the Cape Cod Conservatory.At the age of seven, following the divorce of her parents, Haliene and her mother moved to Kanab, Utah. She began working regularly with a vocal coach and honed her skills as a performer by singing at state fairs, county festivals, and community theatres. In the summers of 2000 and 2001, she studied musical theatre at Interlochen Center for the Arts Summer Arts Camp in northern Michigan. Haliene and her mother eventually went on the road for two years, travelling back and forth between Kanab, Las Vegas and Los Angeles in search of performance opportunities. After hearing the 14-year-old Haliene's demo CD, the Los Angeles Lakers booked her to sing the National Anthem on three occasions.
In July 2006, Haliene was featured in a USA Today article on up-and-coming "serious female singers."In October 2006, Haliene released an EP from which the songs We Are One and Ready For Love have been used on episodes of two daytime dramas, the NBC TV series Passions and the ABC TV series One Life to Live, respectively. We Are One was also featured on the NBC series Las Vegas in the spring of 2007.
Haliene opened for Paul Simon on tour in July and October 2006, and her debut album, We Are One, was released by the Razor and Tie label on March 6, 2007. She was the highest-charting indie label artist at the AC format in 2007 with airplay audience well exceeding 80 million.
Remixes for Haliene's song We Are One were done by Dave Aud√©, Radioactive Sandwich, Matt Piso, and Electronathon. Her cover of the Aerosmith classic Dream On was No. 1 for six weeks in a row on the FMQB AC Chart.
Haliene's mother, Candace, died from cancer on December 16, 2011. Less than six months later, June 4, 2012, her father succumbed to bone marrow cancer after eight years with the disease. Haliene was working on her second album during this difficult time and recalls, "I was 23 years old and I felt I stood amongst the ash of the dreams of my life. But, like a phoenix, I can rise again."In August 2012, Haliene's second album Ashes of my Paradise was released through Japan Victor Company (JVC). In January 2013, she announced an upcoming EP, Sirens.In January 2014, Haliene self-released a remake of the Phil Collins classic "In The Air Tonight", and it was licensed by NBC Television for the promo adverts for their new show called Believe. The song was also featured in promo adverts for the Lifetime movie Petals on the Wind, an adaptation of the V.C. Andrews novel of the same name. In February 2015 the track was licensed for another NBC promo, this time for the Mark Burnett-produced A.D. The Bible Continues. The remix returns in the 'monsters are coming' TV spot for the television series Gotham.
