== History ==
Mutual Benefit was first created as a musical project by Jordan Lee while he was living in Austin, Texas. Lee then moved to Boston in order to meet up with some musicians he wanted to play with. The band consisted of fluid band members, and the band's line-ups on tours were based on which musicians were available at the time. While touring on the road in late 2011, Lee began recording for the album Love's Crushing Diamond. Lyrics and musical composition for the album were written while Lee was living in St. Louis, but the recording began at the Ohm Recording Studio in Austin,  Texas. The album was finished in Boston and released on October 7, 2013. The album became the first Bandcamp release to be named "Best New Music" by Pitchfork.
