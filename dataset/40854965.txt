Upon the release of the film's first trailer on May 18, 2021, the casting of Platt as Evan Hansen and the appearance of the film's version of the character received substantial criticism, with viewers commenting that he, at age 27, was too old to play a high schooler. Platt, however, dismissed the response, comparing his age to those of actors who played high school students in the 1978 film Grease. On August 8, 2021, the criticism against the casting went even further, with emerging claims that nepotism was involved in the decision. In an interview with Zach Sang on his YouTube talk show, Platt said "I think the reaction is largely from people who don’t understand the context of the piece — the fact that I created the role and workshopped it for three years ... Were I not to do the movie, it probably wouldn’t get made. And so, I think, my defensive response is to want to go onto Twitter and be like, 'F you, guys. You don’t even know that this wouldn’t exist without me.' Of course, that's not true entirely and not my place to say. All I have to do is let the work speak for itself." His on-screen performance, as well as the film itself, received a negative reception from critics upon release, leading him to a nomination for Worst Actor at the 42nd Golden Raspberry Awards in 2022.On March 2, 2021, it was announced that Platt was in talks to star in the film adaptation of Grant Ginder's novel The People We Hate at the Wedding.
