== Career ==


=== 2011–present: Canadian fame and first EP releases ===
Kay received Canadian fame when her song "My Name Is Kay" was released with a viral music video in 2011. In December that year, when the song was released onto iTunes on an EP, it peaked at No. 63 on the Canadian Hot 100. The song was never intended to be released as a single, but as the video drew popularity radio stations picked it up and started playing the track. The song was also featured on MuchMusic's 2012 MuchDance compilation CD.


==== My Name Is Kay (EP) ====
Kay released her first EP digitally on December 20, 2011. However, after her label suggested a name change, the EP was pulled from iTunes. On February 28, 2012, Kay re-released the EP, this time featuring different cover art, and a different track-listing than the first. This version was released physically in Canada.
The EP featured guest vocals from rappers Kurtis Blow and Pusha T, as well as song writing credits from the likes of Ryan Tedder (of OneRepublic), Grammy award-winning songwriter Evan Bogart, Cherry Cherry Boom Boom, and producer Doctor Rosen Rosen.
The first pressing of the EP featured a remix or the song "M.A.J.O.R." from Tiësto, but for unknown reasons this remix was not featured on the second pressing.
"M.A.J.O.R." was set to be released to serve as a promotional single for the EP, and a music video for the song was filmed in May 2010. However, the release was replaced with "Diddy Dum", and the music video has yet to be released.
A music video for "Diddy Dum" was released on February 29, 2012, and the song was sent to selected radio stations in Canada as a promotional single. The song failed to chart; however, it received popularity after celebrity blogger Perez Hilton praised the song on his website, along with a link to the video.
The second single from the EP was the track "Strangers", which featured guest vocals from American rapper Pusha T. Following its release on July 4, 2012, the song peaked at number 47 on the Canadian Hot 100. A music video for the song was filmed in Etobicoke, and was released on August 10, 2012.
Kay does not consider "My Name Is Kay" or "Strangers" as singles, and always refers to them as "songs".


==== Say What You Want (EP) ====
On August 21, 2012, Kay released YouTube video, showing herself on a beach while the instrumental for a new song played. The video showed footage of Kay writing the words "Rewind The Track" in the sand, however it was shown in reverse. The video concluded with the messages "KAY VS DOCTOR ROSEN ROSEN" and "September 2012". The concluding message suggested that Kay would be releasing new material in September 2012, but no further detail was given.
However, on October 3, 2012, Kay Tweeted more information about the release, saying it would be an EP entitled "Say What You Want", and that it would be released on November 13, 2012.
To promote the album, Kay posted videos of a friend and herself interviewing the people that she was collaborating with on the EP. These videos were titled "The Laina And Kay Show".
On November 6, 2012, Kay released a short film along with a new song called "Rewind The Track". The film received positive reviews, praising Kay's new direction, and the haunting sound of the song. The version of the song used in the video is slightly different, using less production than the album version.The EP was released on November 13, 2012, as promised, and has a notably darker sound than Kay's previous works, possible due to the fact that she dedicated it to "anyone who's ever been betrayed."On the release date of "Say What You Want", Kay announced the EP was the first of five volumes she would be releasing in the next few months. On October 31, 2012, she also shot a music video for what she called her "next single", a song that was not featured on the EP called "Whatever".The four remaining EPs scheduled to be released were pieced apart in early 2013 for various releases throughout the year under Dim Mak, Mad Decent, Ultra Records and Last Gang Records, culminating on October 22, 2013 with the release of her debut full-length album 'My Name Is Kay'.
