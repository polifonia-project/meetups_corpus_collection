John Watermann (born February 19, 1935 in Berlin; died April 2002 in Brisbane, Australia) was a composer, performer and filmmaker.
Much of his musical work incorporated field recordings, which were heavily treated by electronics, resulting in highly rhythmic music, through the extensive use of cut ups.
Watermann is featured in "BNE - The Definitive Archive: Brisbane Independent Electronic Music Production 1979-2014", which is a hardcover book and USB music archive published by Trans:Com in September 2014.
