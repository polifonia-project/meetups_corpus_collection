He is Jewish, and his ancestry includes Turkish, Lebanese, Mexican and Lithuanian. His great-uncle is activist Herbert Aptheker.
In 2017, he was accused of rape by a woman named Chelsea Tadros, who claimed he met her and another woman at the Standard Hotel in 2013, and “had non-consensual sex with both of us while we were completely incapacitated.” Bensussen replied with a $5 million defamation lawsuit. In 2019, the suit was settled with a joint statement:  "After their discussions, Ms. Tadros acknowledges she does not know who drugged her, and both parties recognized that Ms. Tadros could have been drugged by one of the many attendees that were present on July 5th, 2013. Ms. Tadros continues to maintain that she was drugged and thereby unable to consent on July 5, 2013. Mr. Bensussen maintains that he has never drugged or raped anyone, and that he did not have any indication that Ms. Tadros was drugged or unable to consent."
