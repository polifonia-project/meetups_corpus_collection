Andrés Montañez Rodríguez (born May 7, 1942), better known as Andy Montañez, is a Puerto Rican singer and songwriter.


== Early life ==
Montañez is a native of the Tras Talleres area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico. He is known by the nicknames "El Godfather de la Salsa" and "El Niño De Trastalleres".


== Musical career ==
Montañez first gained fame as a member of the internationally successful El Gran Combo group, with songs like "Hojas blancas" (White Leaves), "Un verano en N.Y." (A Summer in NY), "El barbero loco" (The Crazy Barber), "Julia", "Ponme el alcolado, Juana" (Rub Me With the Bay Rum, Juana), "Vagabundo" (Bum), "El Swing", etc.  He stayed for approximately 15 years, producing 37 LPs. He left El Gran Combo to pursue a career with Venezuelan group La Dimension Latina, creating a feud between the two groups. After leaving El Gran Combo, he enjoyed considerable success on an international scale with his own orchestra, touring Latin America and the United States several times. He represented Puerto Rico at the 1992 World's Fair in Seville, Spain.


== Recent years ==
In recent years, he had teamed up with fellow salsa singer Ismael Miranda to produce some boleros and bohemian music.  By 2005-06 he began creating a new blend between salsa and reggaeton, called salsaton. In April 2006, he released a new album titled Salsatón - Salsa con Reggaetón, which was produced by Sergio George and featured reggaeton rappers Daddy Yankee, Julio Voltio, La Sista, and John Eric. In 2007, he filmed various television advertisements on nutrition for the Puerto Rico Department of Family Affairs (including one in which he sang a rhumba to a dancing carrot).
On November 2, 2006, Montañez won his first Latin Grammy for Best Traditional Tropical Album, together with Pablo Milanés. Montañez was selected to form part of a benefit concert titled “Somos Haití”, where funds would be gathered to support Haiti after the 2008 hurricane season.In 2015, Montañez appeared on Puerto Rican singer Ivy Queen's ninth studio album Vendetta. The album was split into four separate albums, one being an album composed entirely of only salsa music. On the album, Montañez dueted with Queen on a re-recording of his 1988 hit, "Casi Te Envidio".


== Personal life ==
Andy has three children, one daughter and two sons. Montañez's children, Andy Jr. and Harold, and his daughter Lisa have gone on to become salsa singers and have worked with their father for over 25 years, occasionally serving as back-up vocalists at his concerts. His older son, Andy Montañez Jr., died on July 24, 2019 at the age of 54.
