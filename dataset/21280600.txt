== Career ==


=== 2007–2009: Frankisum EP and Complete Me ===
During 2004, Vincent performed as a beatboxer, under the name Mr Mouth.Vincent released his debut EP, Frankisum, in 2007. Former school friend and then assistant of A&R at Island Records, Ben Scarr, introduced Island colleague Louis Bloom to Frankmusik's MySpace page, which was getting a significant number of hits at the time. Although already known for high energy electro and happy hardcore, Frankmusik's signing to Island was in part because Bloom recognised a pop star performer beneath the electronic music, telling HitQuarters: "Underneath all the madness there was some great hooks and melodies, and buried even deeper was a voice; it took a lot of time after signing for him to have the confidence to sing without putting loads of effects over his vocal."In June 2008, Frankmusik remixed the second single by The Clik Clik Did You Wrong, which appeared on the B-side of the 7" single release.
In December 2008, Frankmusik made it on to the long-list of the BBC's Sound of 2009 poll. In the UK, Gaydar Radio was the first national station to champion Frankmusik and tracks from his debut album, Complete Me. Initially interviewed by Alex Baker as part of the station's coverage of National Student Pride, Frankmusik performed a number of live tracks, which were then playlisted as part of an album teaser. His rise to fame was also followed closely by his local radio station, 107.8 Radio Jackie, which was the first station to broadcast his music.
In January and February 2009, he was the support act for Keane on their Perfect Symmetry tour in the UK. In March 2009, he headlined National Student Pride in Brighton's seafront club Digital with Jodie Harsh and Dan Gillespie Sells (The Feeling). In June 2009, Frankmusik was support act for the Pet Shop Boys in London, Manchester and Liverpool. He did a short tour to launch the album Complete Me, starting in Brighton on 17 July and taking in London, Glasgow and Manchester.
Complete Me debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number thirteen in August 2009, after its second single, "Confusion Girl", was A-listed by BBC Radio 1 and reached number twenty-seven on the UK Singles Chart. The other singles were "Better Off as Two", which peaked at number twenty-six, and "3 Little Words".
In August 2009, a more extensive UK tour was announced to take place during November and December 2009. Just two days later on 20 August 2009, it was announced that Frankmusik would join the Perez Hilton Presents tour in Autumn 2009.

In an April 2011 interview, his A&R Louis Bloom said that Frankmusik was at work on his upcoming album.
