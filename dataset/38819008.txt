== Biography ==
Gabriel Katz founded Blind Idiot God with drummer Ted Epstein and guitarist Andy Hawkins in 1982. After three albums, Blind Idiot God went on hiatus in 1996 when Epstein left the group. Katz reunited with Hawkins after Tim Wyskida joined the band as a full-time member. However, he developed tendinitis and hearing problems which further delayed band activities. He joined them on stage for their 2006 tour and performed with them until his departure in 2012. He has named John Coltrane as being the greatest influence to him as a musician, saying "He made me realize that music could be a really powerful tool."
