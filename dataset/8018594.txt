César Camargo Mariano (born 19 September 1943) is a Brazilian pianist, arranger, composer and music producer.


== Biography ==
Mariano was born in São Paulo. In June 1957 the American trombone player Melba Liston invited thirteen-year-old Mariano to participate in her concert at a jazz club in Rio de Janeiro, and he appeared in a program on Rio's Globo Radio called "The Boy Prodigy Who Plays Jazz".
Thar same year, Mariano met Johnny Alf, who went to live with Mariano's family due to their great friendship. Together at the family home in São Paulo, Mariano became familiar with arranging, composing, and the arts of cinema and theatre, thanks to Johnny Alf's encouragement.
Through his own instincts, tenacity and raw talent, Mariano formed amateur instrumental and vocal groups, when TV Record in São Paulo invited him for a special called "Passport to Stardom" (Passaporte para o Estrelato).
In the early 1960s, a teenaged Mariano became famous for his ability to swing and for his legendary left hand. His ensembles of that era, notably Sambalanço Trio and Som Três, are regarded today as high points in Brazilian jazz; so for his 1981 album Samambaia, one of his thirty-plus instrumental albums.
Mariano's collaborations with some of Brazil's most important singers like Wilson Simonal and Elis Regina, brought him global acclaim, such as the historic 1973 album Elis e Tom, recorded with Antônio Carlos Jobim, that featured Mariano as producer, pianist, and musical director.
Since then, Mariano had worked with an international array of musical giants, from Yo-Yo Ma, to Blossom Dearie. He also composed a wealth of soundtrack music for film and TV.
In April 1994, Mariano moved to the United States, where he lives with his wife until now. Mariano received the 2006 Latin Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award.
From his first marriage with singer Marisa Vertullo Brandão, a.k.a. Gata Mansa, he had a son Marcelo Mariano, today an accomplished bass player. He was married to Brazilian superstar Elis Regina for 8 years and they had two children (Pedro Mariano and Maria Rita); today they are both established singers.
From his third marriage of 30 years to Flavia Rodrigues Alves he has a daughter, Luisa Mariano (1986), a singer, vocal producer, music business professional and graduate from Berklee College of Music, who worked at Sony Music, Buddah Brown Entertainment, and currently works freelance as Tour Manager and Vocal Producer.
