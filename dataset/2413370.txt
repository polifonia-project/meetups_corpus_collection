Sandy Rivera is an American house music DJ, record producer and label owner. Born in New York City, he is now based in New Jersey.


== Biography ==
Rivera, born January 18th 1971[@djsandyrivera, Jan 18th 2021], started his career at age 13 as a DJ in his native Spanish Harlem. He began producing house music in 1992, specializing in a more soulful sound. He has worked under a variety of pseudonyms, including Kings of Tomorrow, Soul Vision and Mysterious People, either alone or with partners Jose Burgos, HAZE and Jay 'Sinister' Sealee (Rivera parted ways with Sealee in 2002). He is the owner of labels BlackWiz (founded 1993) and Deep Vision Records (founded 1995).
Rivera's best known track is "Finally", released in 2000 as Kings of Tomorrow on Distance Records, with vocals by Julie McKnight, which peaked at number 24 in the UK Singles Chart and at number 17 on the Billboard dance chart, and appeared in a large number of compilations from labels such as  Defected Records, Ministry of Sound, Hed Kandi, and Warner Music. The track is included in K.O.T.'s first album It's in the Lifestyle. The same album also yielded the track "Young Hearts". The vocal version of "Finally" was also used as a part of a remixed single by the British act Layo & Bushwacka for their 2003 single "Love Story (vs. Finally)". The second K.O.T. album was released in 2005, titled Trouble. Rivera claims this is his first album produced without recourse to samples, and marks the official separation between this and other aliases: Kings of Tomorrow is used for more radio-friendly tracks, while his real name will be used for club-friendly tracks.
As a producer and remixer, Sandy Rivera has worked for a variety of other artists, including veteran jazz musician Terry Callier, Gisele Jackson, Bini & Martini, Michelle Weeks, Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Walter L. Robinson.
