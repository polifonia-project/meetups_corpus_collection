== Life and career ==


=== 1989–2007: Early life ===
Sam Teskey was born in 1989 at his parents home in Warrandyte, Victoria, in the room above what is now their studio. He attended a local primary school with no year levels. He was close to his brother Josh, with Josh saying in 2021, "We had these bird calls we'd do so we could always find each other in bush near where we lived. We also used them at parties when we were teenagers. I'd do the call and Sam would materialise out of the crowd." The two started playing music together after moving to a Steiner high school when Josh was 15 and Sam 13. Josh said "I jumped straight into singing and then played guitar, but Sam focused on the guitar".

In 2008, Josh and Sam formed the blues rock band, the Teskey Brothers alongside Brendon Love and Liam Gough. The band became a fixture at the St Andrews Market, performing at regular spots in Warrandyte and bars in Melbourne, as well as other private shows. The band released their debut studio album, Half Mile Harvest in 2017 which peaked at number 18 on the ARIA Charts. The band's second studio album, Run Home Slow was released in 2019 and peaked at number 2 on the ARIA Charts and won three ARIA Music Awards at the 2019 awards.
