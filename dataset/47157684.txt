"I've never ever in all the years I've done this show heard a guy with the talent you've got. Seriously. And the version was sensational, and that shows to me that actually, you're more than a singer, you're an artist, and that's why you got that (the buzzer)."

In October 2018, Scott released a new single titled "No Matter What". Upon release, Scott said:

"'No Matter What' is without question the most personal song I have ever written and the one I am most proud of. It's a song born from loneliness, acceptance and the heartbreaking but liberating tale of my coming out experience. What I love about this song is that it isn't just limited to a story of sexual identity, but about the relationship between parent and child and acceptance as a whole. This song didn't make my debut album because I simply wasn't ready at that time to give it to the world."
