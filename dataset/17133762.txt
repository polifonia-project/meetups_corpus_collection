== Biography ==
Tommy DeCarlo was born in Rome, New York, located 50 miles east of Syracuse, New York.
DeCarlo discovered and became a fan of Boston at age 12. Years later he began writing his own music in the 1990s and recording covers of himself singing his favorite Boston songs. He posted these recordings on his daughter's MySpace page.
In March 2007, original Boston lead singer Brad Delp unexpectedly died at the age of 55. To honor Delp, DeCarlo wrote and recorded an emotional song about his favorite vocalist. His daughter suggested that he post that song as well, on her Myspace page.
Another Boston fan heard DeCarlo's work and suggested that he send his Myspace page link to Boston management. DeCarlo sent the link, and was approached by Boston founder Tom Scholz not long after. At the time, DeCarlo was working at a Charlotte area Home Depot as a Credit Manager.
Scholz invited DeCarlo to perform at the Brad Delp Tribute Concert, which was happening soon at the Bank of America Pavilion in Boston, MA. Later in 2007 DeCarlo was hired by Scholz as the vocalist of Boston. He has toured with the band on all tours since 2008.
Tommy DeCarlo currently resides near Charlotte, North Carolina with his wife Annie.
Recently, Tommy recorded and released an audiobook of his life events from birth through becoming a singer for Boston. The recording of the book occurred throughout 2020 and 2021. It is currently available on audible.
