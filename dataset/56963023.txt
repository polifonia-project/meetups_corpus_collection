== Early life ==
Rylan Talerico was born on October 2, 1998 in Boca Raton, Florida.
The oldest of two children born into a musical family, Rylan began playing the drums at age 2 under the influence of his father Justin Talerico

, a longtime drummer and respected member of the family's local music and arts community.
Throughout his teenage years Talerico was a dedicated student of music, serving as frontman and guitarist for South Florida underground punk band Wallace, as well as teaching guitar, drums and bass at a local music school throughout high school.
Talerico describes this period of his life as something of a turning point for him, telling PR Newswire "In my freshman year, I picked up a guitar and that was it… From that point forward, all I could do was music."
He has since relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, where he currently resides.

At age 17, Talerico disbanded South Florida underground punk band Wallace to focus on developing his rapidly evolving musical interests, exploring a more pop-oriented writing, recording and producing style.
Adapting his childhood family nickname, Brother Sundance
, he wrote and produced his debut EP Honey in the bedroom of his family home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida throughout the spring of 2017.
While mixing the record at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, Talerico was introduced to Jeff Hanson—former artist manager of critically acclaimed artists Paramore, Creed, Alter Bridge & Sevendust—and was signed to Hanson's record label Silent Majority Group shortly after.
