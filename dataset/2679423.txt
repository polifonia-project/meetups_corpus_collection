By the 2003 release of her third studio album Ei (No), Vilkkumaa established her status as one of the prominent contemporary Finnish musicians—the album debuted at number one on the Albums Chart, while charting for over a year (56 weeks), and sold over 120,000 copies (double-platinum) in Finland. Ei earned her three Emma Awards; for Female Soloist of the Year, Album of the Year and Pop/Rock Album of the Year.Ei was followed by Vilkkumaa's fourth studio album Se ei olekaan niin (But It's Not Like That) in 2005, which sold over 47,000 copies and earned the artist her second platinum certification and the 2005 Emma Award for Female Soloist of the Year.
