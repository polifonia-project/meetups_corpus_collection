Warren joined Dio to play keyboards on the Strange Highways release in 1994. Warren stayed in the band until Dio's death in 2010 from stomach cancer; he was the second longest-standing member of the band after Dio himself. A highlight of his work with Dio is his keyboard solo on the song "Before The Fall", from the 2002 album Killing the Dragon. After Ronnie James Dio's death Warren wrote
"How can I express what 17 years next to Ronnie now means to me? He has led me on an incredible journey. I have been blessed by his presence, and his voice. He was my surrogate father, my brother, my friend, my teacher AND my loyal advocate. Our fearless leader. He never let us down. He was never not out to prove it. Because he 'WAS' it. Just a class act. Life without him will never be the same. Yet it is not because of these things, that I know He IS in Heaven. But that's another story.
I will miss you, my dear friend.

"RJD RIP"
Scott also filled in on keyboards for Josh Silver in the band Type O Negative on their last tour.
