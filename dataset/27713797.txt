Yannis Kyriakides (Greek: Γιάννης Κυριακίδης, born 1 August 1969) is a composer of contemporary classical music, and sound art. His music explores new forms and hybrids of media, synthesizing disparate sound sources and highlighting the sensorial space of music. He has focused in the majority of his work on ways of combining traditional performance practices  with digital media, particularly in the use of live electronics. The relation between music and language has been explored in many pieces that utilize text films as a multimedia element.


== Biography ==
Yannis Kyriakides was born in Limassol, Cyprus and emigrated to the United Kingdom when he was five years of age. He studied music at the University of York, and later moved to the Netherlands to study composition at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague with composers Louis Andriessen and Dick Raaijmakers. He is co-founder of the record label UNSOUNDS,  and teaches composition at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague.
He has been associated with ensembles such as the Asko Ensemble, musikFabrik, Ensemble MAE, Icebreaker, Seattle Chamber Players, and Ensemble Integrales and musicians such as Andy Moor from the Ex and trumpeter Marco Blaauw. He also regularly collaborates with visual artists and filmmakers HC Gilje, Joost Rekveld and Stefanos Tsivopoulos, as well as choreographers Leine & Roebana, Guy & Roni, and theatre maker Paul Koek. 
In 2007 he was featured composer at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival and in 2011 at November Music in The Netherlands. His opera An Ocean of Rain opened the Aldeburgh Festival in 2008, and two of his sound installations were shown in the Dutch Pavilion at the Venice Biennale 2011.
