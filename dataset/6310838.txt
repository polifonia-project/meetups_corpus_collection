Osbern (c. 1050 – c. 1090) was a Benedictine monk, hagiographer and musician, precentor of Christ Church, Canterbury. He is sometimes confused with Osbert de Clare, alias Osbern de Westminster. He is known as "the monk Osbern" or just "Monk Osbern".


== Biography ==
He was born at Canterbury and brought up by Godric, who was dean from 1058–1080. He became a monk, and later precentor of Christ Church, and was ordained by Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury (d. 1089). He died probably between 1088 and 1093.
He was very skillful in music and is said to have written two treatises: De re musica and De vocum consonantiis. But he is known best as translator of saints' lives from the Anglo-Saxon and as an original writer. William of Malmesbury praises the elegance of his style.


== Writings ==
Vita S. Alphegi et de translatione S. Alphegi ("Life and Translation of St Ælfheah"), in prose. It was written at Lanfranc's request, about 1080 when there arose some dispute concerning Ælfheah's sanctity. See the remarks in William of Malmesbury's Gesta Pontificum.Rumble, Alexander R. (ed.) and R. Morris and A. R. Rumble (trs.) (1994). "Translatio Sancti Ælfegi Cantuariensis archiepiscopi et martiris (BHL 2519)".  In Alexander R. Rumble (ed.). The Reign of Cnut: King of England, Denmark and Norway. Studies in the Early History of Britain. London: Leicester UP. pp. 283–315.

Vita S. Odonis archiepiscopi Cantuariensis. From William of Malmesbury's Gesta pontificum Anglorum we learn that Osbern wrote a life of Odo, but the work has now perished.
(Henry Wharton, in his Anglia Sacra (London, 1691), 75–87, published a life of St. Bregwin which was wrongly attributed to Osbern).
In addition, two letters which he wrote to Anselm abbot of Bec, probably about 1093, are preserved.
