Lisa Lynne is a Celtic harpist, a composer and new-age recording artist. She is a self-proclaimed multi-instrumentalist who has "spent the last eighteen years pursuing her passion for the Celtic harp."
Lynne released her first solo albums, starting in 1992, as Lisa Franco on the German label Innovative Communication. Also in the early 1990s, she became part of the group Celestial Winds, with David Young, releasing a number of albums. 
Since 1998, Lynne has released albums of Celtic harp music on New Earth Records, Windham Hill Records and her own label, Lavender Sky Music. Her 2003 release, Hopes & Dreames (New Earth) reached #6 on Billboard Magazine's Top New Age Albums chart.
In 2002, Lynne became the first musician-in-residence at City of Hope National Cancer Center in Los Angeles. Her program "Hands on Harps," integrates music in the treatment programs at City of Hope.
Music from her Love & Peace album was used in Alone in the Wilderness, a documentary from filmmaker Bob Swerer that aired on PBS, chronicling the life of Richard Proenneke in the Alaskan wilderness.
