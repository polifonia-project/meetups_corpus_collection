Anneli Marian Drecker (born 12 February 1969, Tromsø, Norway) is a Norwegian singer and actress from the city of Tromsø. She is the frontwoman for the dream pop band Bel Canto.


== Life and career ==

Drecker's father Peter, a German from Bielefeld, emigrated in 1960 to Norway.
In the fall of 2006 Bel Canto celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the first album with several concerts. She has released three solo albums, and has provided vocals for various artists including Motorpsycho, Jan Bang, Savoy, a-ha, Röyksopp, Jah Wobble, Ketil Bjørnstad, Simon Raymonde, Mental Overdrive, Illumination and Hector Zazou.Drecker contributed as composer and singer in a production of Pär Lagerkvist's Bøddelen at Det Norske Teatret (2000), and has worked as a freelance actress and composer at Hålogaland Teater from 2009 to 2015.
She worked with fellow Norwegians Röyksopp,  since 1999-2012 including as the vocalist on the track "Sparks" and as their live vocalist (as heard on their live album Royksopp's Night Out), on three songs on their album Junior. Additionally, she appeared with countrymen a-ha on their Minor Earth, Major Sky Tour and appeared on the live DVD Live from Vallhall and the following album from their European Tour, How Can I Sleep With Your Voice In My Head..
In 2004 she was a jury member in the Norwegian version of Pop Idol. She continues to occasionally perform live in Norway.
In 2012 Drecker took part in the NRK TV-show Stjernekamp, first season. 
In 2014 she appeared again on TV2 as one of the artists in the famous series "Hver Gang Vi Møtes".
On her latest album Rocks And Straws (2015) we are given the home reversion of a journey that began in 1986 with Bel Canto. During the journey, it became increasingly clearer to Drecker where she comes from, and the music she creates is the result of this Nordic arctic acoustic landscape, with influences of music from all around the world. She has composed the music with lyrics based on poems by the Northern Norwegian poet Arvid Hanssen. At the Vossajazz festival 2015, Drecker performed the tune "Little Tree" from this album, with her daughter Luna (b. 2006).
