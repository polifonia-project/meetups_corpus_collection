Matthew Tuck (born 20 January 1980) is a Welsh singer-songwriter and musician. He is the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of heavy metal band Bullet for My Valentine, formerly called Jeff Killed John. He is also a singer and guitarist in the supergroup AxeWound, which was formed in 2012.


== Career ==

Bullet for My Valentine formed in 1998 under the name Jeff Killed John and were originally a nu metal band. After bassist Nick Crandle left in 2003, they picked up Jason James as their new bassist and renamed the band Bullet for My Valentine. They have released six studio albums and four EPs. The band has sold over one million albums in the United States and over three million worldwide and are the most-successful act in the Kerrang! Awards category of "Best British Band" with three wins.
Tuck is also the backing vocalist and rhythm guitarist in the supergroup AxeWound. He plays alongside Liam Cormier of Cancer Bats, Mike Kingswood of Glamour of the Kill, Joe Copcutt of ZOAX and formerly of Rise to Remain, and Jason Bowld of Pitchshifter.In November 2006, while on tour with As I Lay Dying and Protest the Hero, Tuck suffered from laryngitis, which led to a series of concert cancellations, until early January 2007 when he was able to sing after his recovery period.
On 22 June 2007 it was announced that he needed a tonsillectomy. The band was forced to cancel all of their shows, including their tour as a support band for Metallica. Unable to speak, Tuck wrote that as soon as doctors cleared him he would be in the studio working on the band's next album.


== Influences ==
Tuck's earliest influences as a child would involve the music his parents listened to. In particular, his father's favourite band was Status Quo who he would hear the vinyls of a lot as a little kid, as well as Bruce Springsteen's records.Tuck's main influences would go on to consist of Nirvana, Pantera, Slayer, Machine Head, Iron Maiden, Motley Crue, Def Leppard, Limp Bizkit and Jimmy Eat World.However, his biggest influence growing up was Metallica, with their eponymous Black Album being the first record he ever bought after he heard the song "Enter Sandman" for the first time. They would also be the main reason as to why he would start to play the guitar, learning the riffs by ear; eventually paving the way for his musical career.


== Equipment ==
A detailed gear diagram of Tuck's 2006 Bullet for My Valentine guitar rig is well-documented.
During the period from Bullet for My Valentine's debut album The Poison in 2005 to the making of Temper Temper seven years later, Tuck was using Jackson Randy Rhoads V models. During the tour cycle for Temper Temper, he revealed he has left Jackson and was now endorsing B.C. Rich who made him a Signature V based upon their JRV models.
More recently, Tuck acquired a pair of Kirk Hammett ultra-limited edition Gibson Flying Vs. He also uses black Gibson Les Pauls from time to time. Currently, for his backline he uses Fractal Audio Axe FX guitar effects modelling systems in lieu of a conventional setup.


== Personal life ==
Tuck married Charlotte Beedell on 7 September 2013 in London. The couple have a son who was born in 2010. They filed for divorce in early 2016 but later reconciled.
