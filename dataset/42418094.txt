While in secondary school, Peters met Tha Suspect, a record producer and recording artist. The two started a group after becoming acquainted with each other. Capital Hill Records was formed after Peters returned to Nigeria from South Africa. He and Suspect decided to look for a female artist who could rap and sing. At a later date, Peters signed Kel to his record label after being introduced to her by Terry tha Rapman. In September 2010, Kel had a misunderstanding with Peters, which led to the termination of her recording contract. The rapper managed to release her debut studio album, The Investment, while signed to the label. Latterly, the label partnered with the Goretti Company, a management company owned by Illbliss.


=== Controversy ===
In January 2014, a copyright infringement was levelled against Peters after the release of Tiwa Savage's "Eminado" video. He allegedly stole the vintage nature of the "Asinamali" video which was released by Tumi and the Volume to honour the artistic works of Seydou Ke√Øta. Tumi took to Twitter to slander Peters. He urged his fans to shine a light on the issue. Savage's manager and husband, Tunji "Tee Billz" Balogun, shed some light on the controversy. He said they never knew that the video's concept was adopted from another video, and were surprised as everyone else.After the release of Ice Prince's "VIP" music video on 21 June 2013, Peters was accused of plagiarising the contents of Slaughterhouse's "My Life" video and implementing them into the "V.I.P" video. In February 2014, Ice Prince defended the actions of Peters and said he told him the ideas to shoot. He also said that if anyone has a problem with the situation, they should hold him responsible.
