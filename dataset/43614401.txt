Attending the "Dance Kiss FM" events in London as a teenager, Audio became familiar with the jungle and Drum and bass scene and soon booked his own party with DJs Ed Rush & Optical. He was hired as studio engineer at the UK hard house label "Alphamagic" and later became an A&R. In 2002, he founded "Resonant Evil" along with Colin Worth and Jason Bull, for which he released several records until 2005. His debut album To the Edge Of Reason, released in 2008 on Tech Freak Recordings, received praises throughout the scene and also caught the attention of Virus Recordings executives Ed Rush & Optical (DJ) where he subsequently was signed to. His follow-up albums Genesis Device and Soul Magnet saw further  successful singles such as "Vacuum" and "Headroom". In 2013, his final album with Virus Recordings came out after his successful "Sabretooth" remix by Optiv & BTK.
