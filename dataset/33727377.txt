=== Body Count album cover ===
Halili's artwork on the cover of Body Count came to symbolize the band's song "Cop Killer", which was widely criticized by the authorities, and raised questions about the boundaries between artistic freedom and censorship. This controversy, together with an executive clash over Halili's proposed montage for the jacket of Home Invasion, forced Ice-T to leave Warner Bros. Records. On March 23, 1993, Ice-T released the album with Halili's original illustration, produced by his own record label Rhyme $yndicate Records.


== Personal life ==
Halili resides and works in Orange County, California, where he runs a studio and screen printing workshop named Halili-Style Graphics & More.Halili is also a lifetime member of the Universal Zulu Nation and the original Los Angeles-based Rhyme $yndicate. A friendship between Halili and TV producer Michael G. Moye led to a fortuitous business co-op where Halili designed and manufactured media publicity products for Fox's first prime-time T.V. sitcom Married... with Children.
