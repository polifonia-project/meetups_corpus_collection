Titica is an Angolan singer and dancer, who is a kuduro musician. She was named "best kuduro artist of 2011".


== Career ==
Titicia's popularity stems from the artist's ability to fuse different styles into her ability and embracing her uniqueness in the Angolan music industry. Her stage name is Portuguese for worthless or useless; she chose that stage name to reclaim the hateful words that people have thrown at her as a trans woman. Her success in the industry combats the homophobic and transphobic sentiments that exist in Angola and globally. She combines her training in ballet with traditional kuduro dance styles to portray a unique and personalized brand of femininity and control over her body.


=== Early career ===
Born Teca Miguel Garcia in Luanda, Titica began her career as a back-up dancer with acts such as Noite & Dia, Propria Lixa and Puto Portugues. Her first recording of a single was unplanned. She had only been intending to help Noite & Dia with inspiration to develop a chorus for a track, and the studio session resulted in recording Titica's voice for the track. This experience began Titica's music-recording career. A year later, in October 2011, she recorded “Chão” and became an international success, particularly within Angola and the Angolan diaspora.


=== Influences ===
Titica is very public about her Congolese background and the influence that this has on her music. In her Red Bull Music Academy lecture in Berlin 2018, she discusses some of her influences: “I have a Congolese background. I listened to lots of music from Congo. Pépé Kallé [and] Koffi Olomide, who inspired me a lot.” She further states that her music combines kuduro with the Congolese genres Kallé and N’dombolo.Another source of Titica's inspiration is female kuduro artist Fofandó. Titica discusses this influence in the same Red Bull Music Academy lecture, “One of the most important female artists in the kuduro scene was Fofandó, who is the queen of kuduro. You hear around the world, in Brazil they say that I’m the queen of kuduro, but kuduro has a queen who inspired us and I looked up to.”


=== Activism and Advocacy ===
In 2013, she was named a goodwill ambassador for UNAIDS. Through this role and her international popularity, Titica has increased awareness of HIV risks and treatment, sexual health, and issues regarding the LGBT community. In her statement with UNAIDS, Titica shares, "I have been beaten and stoned for who I am. I have suffered so much humiliation but I am ready to lead by example and help overcome stigma and discrimination in my country and beyond."In addition to her platform as an internationally acclaimed public figure, Titica spreads awareness about these issues through the lyrics of her music. In her 2012 collaboration with popular Angolan singer Ary, “Ohla O Boneca”, Titica makes “a bold stand for equal love.” BBC also reports that her 2016 release “Abaixa” featuring DJ João Linho “became an anthem for how to fight homophobia in Angola”.


=== International Performances ===
Titica performed in Brazil in 2017. where she released her song, "Capim Guiné" with the group BaianaSystem in Rio de Janeiro.
