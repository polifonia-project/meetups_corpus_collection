In 1998, Hirano joined the Tokyo Child Theatrical Group division of the Space Craft Group company.

== Personal life ==
In November 2010, Hirano posted a message on her Twitter account that she has had a pituitary gland tumor since junior high school. While not malignant, the tumor exerts pressure on certain motor functions, resulting in temporary memory loss, loss of vision and slurring of speech. She decided against elective surgery because the surgery would alter her nasal cavity and permanently modify her voice.


== Public image ==
Once The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya broadcast in 2006, Hirano received widespread media attention and popularity, which led her to be known as a "super idol" in the voice acting industry. In 2007, she was ranked No. 36 in Daitan Map's Top 50 Voice Actors. She also notably became a voice actor who was able to cross over to mainstream media, where she began appearing on variety shows since 2010. In 2011, Hirano was the 5th best-selling voice actress, making ¥120 million in total sales.Beginning in 2010, Hirano drew criticism from her anime otaku fanbase when she openly discussed her dating and sex life on the variety show Goût Temps Nouveau, as well as the implication that she was abandoning voice acting in favor of a career in mainstream entertainment. In early 2011, an acquaintance of a Lantis employee leaked that Hirano had sexual relations with three of her male band members, leading to the dismissal of all four of them; in August 2011, Japanese magazine Bubka published photos of their affair. The incidents have caused several fans to destroy her merchandise and create petitions to remove her from her role in Kizumonogatari. Hirano stopped posting on Twitter beginning on May 18, 2013, allowing her team to use her account as an information channel.
