=== Public image ===

As a musical entertainer, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu has been recognized as the "J-Pop Princess" or "Harajuku Pop Princess".Her fashion sense is the subject of much media coverage. Kyary is often called "Japan's Lady Gaga", citing her similar use of fashion to attract attention. A review of her London concert stated "[Kyary] is not supposed to be musically talented. She is more about image featuring her creative fashion sense as one of the main subjects of her career, not just the music." She has cited American singers Gwen Stefani, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga as her inspirations in both music and fashion. Kyary's fashion sense has also been criticized. While being interviewed on TV Asahi's Music Station, she was wearing an oversized ribbon on her head, which blocked Japanese boy band Kanjani8 from being seen on camera, angering fans of Kanjani8 by her outrageous fashion style. She later stated that when she is being interviewed on television, she would restrict what she is wearing. Kyary's fans, however, defended her wearing the outfit. Kyary Pamyu Pamyu cites "kawaii" (meaning "cute" or "cuteness") as her background style.Her international success has also received much attention. During an interview with The Fader, Kyary was asked if she meant to make music outside of Asia, where she responded; "At first, I didn't think about global markets at all. But even in Japanese, my lyrics don't make any sense and have a kind of mystery, like on "Pon Pon Pon" and "Tsukematsukeru". I can feel that what I'm doing in Japanese is catchy to global audiences anyway." Keiichi Ishizaka, chairman and CEO of Warner Music Japan Inc, commented on her image to The Japan Times, saying "[Kyary] is a person who came directly out of Tokyo's Harajuku culture, and there is a growing international interest in Japan's kawaii culture." Many critics and publications noted the increase in popularity of Japanese pop culture outside Japan, such as its fashion and animation, and Kyary's role as its global ambassador. Ishizaka believed that with the advent of the Internet, there is no difference in time and distance among countries anymore." Seibu Railway honored her by running a train on the Seibu Ikebukuro Line, part of their Seibu 9000 series, from June to September 2016, themed on the pop star's music videos, which also passed through her birthplace Nishitōkyō, Tokyo.


=== In the media ===
Many of Kyary's singles, including "Candy Candy", "Invader Invader", and "Fashion Monster" have generated millions of views on YouTube. Her single "Furisodation" generated minor controversy in Japan, where a citizens' group believed the video encouraged alcohol and smoking, a claim which her label denied.
