== Career ==


=== Cowboys International ===
Lockie fronted his own band Cowboys International, releasing the album The Original Sin (1979).  The band recorded and played with many punk- and new wave-era musicians including:


=== Solo career ===
The band toured extensively throughout the UK and in Europe in 1980, at which point Lockie pursued a solo career with Virgin Records, releasing the album The Impossible (1981), featuring guest appearances by Shears and Simon, as well as:


=== Public Image Ltd ===
Later in 1981, Lockie went to the United States to join Public Image Ltd (PiL) in New York City, New York, in 1981 in preparation for recording in Chicago, Illinois, in November of that year.  His contributions to PiL stemmed back to PiL's album Metal Box (1979) where he contributed and co-wrote "Radio 4" (although not officially credited).
Due to complications with Virgin and funding, recording in 1981 was delayed.  PiL entered into various recording sessions in New York City during this period until finally entering into Park South Studios to record what became Commercial Zone (1984) in 1982 and 1983.  At this point, Lockie was no longer a contributor to PiL.


=== Independent Producer ===
After his departure from PIL in 1982, Lockie found some success in dance music, co-producing, with Ivan Baker; and co-writing, with Stuart Agarbright, the song "Dominatrix Sleeps Tonight".  Arthur Baker of Streetwise Records picked up on the single and it became a success in the spring of 1984 (number one on the Billboard Dance Chart for ten weeks).  This track would later become part of the soundtrack to the American comedy film Grosse Pointe Blank (1997).  In 1985, CBS / Epic Records released the 12" Single "Get On Top" and "K2" under the band name Go For Your Gun, produced by Ken Lockie the single featured Stuart Argabright and Laura Lockie.


=== Pnuma Recordings ===
In 2003, he founded his own label Pnuma Recordings, and re-issued a collection of Cowboys International recordings from The Original Sin album and various singles on CD.  He recorded a new Cowboys International album The Backwards Life of Romeo (2004), performing a live show at Eyedrum in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2005.  In 2011 and continuing to 2019, Lockie began producing and releasing Techno, Tech House, Minimal, Deep House and other genres on the Pnuma Recordings label.
