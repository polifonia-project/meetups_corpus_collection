Gary Burr, born in Meriden, Connecticut, is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer, primarily in the country music genre. Many of the songs he has written have become Top-10 hits, the first of which was "Love's Been A Little Bit Hard On Me" released by Juice Newton (#7 on Billboard's Hot 100) in 1982. He became a member of the group Pure Prairie League (1982 to 1985), taking over after Vince Gill departed the group.
