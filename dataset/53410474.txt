== Life and career ==


=== 1994-2016: Early life ===
Born in São Luís, Phabullo is a dizygotic twin and has an older sister. Phabullo spent part of her childhood and adolescence living in the cities of Santa Inês and Caxias, both in the interior of Maranhão, due to financial difficulties. She never knew her father, who abandoned her mother, a nurse, when she was pregnant with her.During her childhood, Phabullo experienced bullying because of her delicate gestures and feminine voice. She was physically assaulted with a plate of hot soup thrown over her face. She attended ballet classes during this period.At the age of 13, Phabullo began doing covers at family parties and school performances and joined a choir at a Catholic church. Soon after, she began songwriting. Later, she decided to become a professional, moving to São Paulo with her sister, where she worked in several places, such as snack bars and beauty salons. Soon after, she moved to Uberlândia with her mother, who had recently married. At the age of 15, she came out to her mother, who had suspected that she was gay; her sister already knew about her sexual orientation. her mother, whom she talks to daily, is supportive of her sexual orientation.

She then began to go out for the night in Maranhão, to make friends, and to participate as one of a selection of singers in a house of shows. She started performing her own songs and impersonating celebrities for a small fee, but it was not a professional job. She was now dressing feminine, but did not identify herself as a drag queen; the first time that she did drag was at age 17 in Uberlândia, to publicize a party of her friend by delivering pamphlets at the door of a nightclub. With time, she started performing in LGBT parades in several cities of Maranhão and became known by the state's LGBT community. At age 18, in Minas Gerais, Phabullo started participating in and winning some beauty contests in full drag, before beginning her professional career as a singer while adopting the stage name of "Pabllo Knowles", an homage to singer Beyoncé. Her first performance as a drag queen occurred at the Belgrano nightclub, of producers Ian Hayashi and Leocádio Rezende (whom Phabullo would later call her "parents").Still in Minas Gerais, Phabullo took a university entrance exam by the Federal University of Uberlândia, where she was admitted to the full design course in 2013, but after some periods she dropped out of college due to her schedule of shows, which increased greatly due to the success of her music videos on the internet and her participation in the band of primetime television program Amor & Sexo.When she attracted attention from entrepreneurs in the entertainment field, Phabullo began her musical career professionally, performing in bars and concert halls in Uberlândia and cities of the region. In this period, Phabullo adopted the stage name of Pabllo Vittar.Vittar appeared on TV for the first time in 2014, on a Brazilian talent singing show, performing "I Have Nothing" by Whitney Houston. She became famous in the media in 2015 with the success of her music video "Open Bar", a Portuguese-language version of Major Lazer's song "Lean On" with original lyrics, produced by Bonde do Rolê and Omulu. In less than four months, the video reached one million views on YouTube. She also released an extended play with the same name, using pop hits' instrumentals with new arrangements and lyrics.

== Artistry ==


=== Musical and vocal style ===
Vittar is mainly a pop singer, although her music incorporates other genres. Her debut studio album Vai Passar Mal mixes pop with elements of electronic music and Brazilian genres such as tecno brega, arrocha, funk carioca, and forró. Music critics noted that her second studio album Não Para Não follows a similar formula, mixing Brazilian and international influences. Speaking about the latter album, Vittar explained: "I lived in Santa Izabel do Pará and listened to cumbia, carimbó, tecnobrega and guitarrada. In Maranhão, I heard axé and Bahia pagode... Pabllo Vittar is all over this album, I cannot go against my origins." Her lyrics often explore themes such as love, self-confidence, and partying.Vittar is a countertenor with 2.3 octaves of vocal extension already exhibited, spanning from flat E in the third octave (E♭3) to G# in the fifth octave (G♯5). Sérgio Anders, a singing professor at the State University of Minas Gerais, considers Vittar to have "an infantile voice in an adult male". While he views Vittar as a good singer, Anders opines that her technique is not very developed. Shannon Sims of The New York Times described Vittar's voice as a "nasal soprano".


=== Influences ===

Vittar grew up listening to artists such as Aretha Franklin, Donna Summer, Whitney Houston, and Tina Turner, whom she imitated as a child before she even considered becoming a drag queen, as well as Gilberto Gil, Ney Matogrosso, Elis Regina, Alcione Nazareth, and Caetano Veloso. She became interested in drag after watching the reality show RuPaul's Drag Race and cited RuPaul as an important inspiration: "All the drag artists in this world have to thank RuPaul for the visibility we have today." Some participants of the show have also influenced Vittar, notably April Carrion and Naomi Smalls. Model Bella Hadid visually influences her, especially her makeup and style. Her music and performances are greatly influenced by bands such as Banda Batidão and Companhia do Calypso.Early in her career, she used the stage name Pabllo Knowles as a reference to Beyoncé. Other influences include Rihanna, Kanye West, Lady Gaga, and Britney Spears, as well as her "Sua Cara" collaborators Anitta and Major Lazer. While making her debut album Vai Passar Mal, Vittar explained that she listened to several artists to find inspiration, citing Liniker and Elza Soares as examples. The album was also influenced by Lana Del Rey, Allie X, Rihanna's album Anti, and Beyoncé's album Lemonade.


== Public image and impact ==
 Vittar's music is considered as "unofficial anthems for Brazil's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community" and she is widely viewed as a voice for them. Because dangers to LGBTQ+ people have grown in Brazil, Vittar's openness about being gay has made her an icon to those living in a prejudiced environment. As an openly gay Brazilian drag queen, Vittar has served as a positive representation of homosexuality and gender fluidity. She used her visibility to support LGBTQ+ individuals in Brazil and in other countries in South America. She said: "They tell me a lot about their daily struggle to go out on the street being gay, being drag. I want to give them strength so they can continue being who they are." Vittar also appeared on A Força do Querer ("Edge of Desire"), a popular soap opera about a transgender man. After seeing Vittar perform at the Rock in Rio festival, actor Fábio Assunção wrote in a Facebook post: "You represent the possibility of truth in a sea of hypocrisy. Your public figure is the voice of many suffocated people."In an interview for Veja magazine, Vittar revealed that she chose a masculine stage name because she wanted to be truthful to the public, since she is not transgender. She only acts as a woman when she's on stage as Pabllo Vittar and has a more typical masculine gender expression in her private life. During the same interview, Vittar said she is "making music for humans." Since her debut, Vittar became the most followed and most streamed drag queen in the world, surpassing RuPaul. In 2020, Vittar was featured in a campaign for Calvin Klein, as part of the designer's pride collection.
