== Biography ==


=== Rondells ===
Gary Young (drums, vocals) and Wayne Duncan (bass guitar, vocals) were the rhythm section of many bands, particularly instrumental groups, from the early 1960s onwards. One of these was The Rondells who were also the backing band for Bobby & Laurie, a popular singing duo with their No. 1 hit "Hitch Hiker" from 1966. Young joined the Rondells in 1964, at the age of 17, whilst still at Carey Baptist Grammar School.The Rondells had developed from a 1962 school band, The Silhouettes, which were a Shadows-style instrumental band with Ian B. Allen (bass), future Aztec Gil Matthews (guitar), Ed Nantes (guitar), Roger Treble (lead guitar) and Young (drums). This group changed its name to The Lincolns in 1963, by which time Matthews had left and they were managed by Ron Blackmore. Bassist Duncan (ex-Ramrods), who had learnt bass from Allen, replaced Allen who left to join the Planets. The Lincolns added singer Bob Johnson when beat music broke through in 1964. Young later took over on vocals from Johnson, but tired of having to sing and play drums, he quit in early 1965 to form the vocal duo Double Trouble with Issy Dye and was replaced in The Lincolns by drummer Barry Gough. Double Trouble split soon after and Young rejoined Duncan, Treble and rhythm guitarist John Sullivan (who was later replaced by Barry Rogers) in a new touring version of The Lincolns, which was billed as The Rondells whenever they backed another Blackmore act, Bobby & Laurie. They also backed other Blackmore artists such as Bobby Knight, Lynne Randell, Buddy England, Billy Adams and Bobby Shore. Young also played in The Changing Times and Ram Jam Big Band. In February 1967, following the split of Bobby & Laurie, Laurie Allen put together a soul revue, originally called Dice, later renamed The Laurie Allen Revue. The lineup included The Rondells' Young, Barry Rogers and Duncan, guitarist Phil Manning and as backing singers, sisters Glenys and Colleen Hewett. The Revue released three singles on Festival Records â€“ "Beautiful Brown Eyes" (August 1967), "Any Little Bit" (April 1968) and "As Long As I Got You" (June 1968).
