Lil' Troy, who featured in his songs many members of Houston's thriving rap scene of the late 1990s, managed to reach national audiences with his single "Wanna Be a Baller". The song reached No. 70 on the Billboard Hot 100, and propelled his Shortstop/Me & Mine Entertainment debut album, Sittin' Fat Down South, to the Top 25 albums on the Billboard 200. After the success of the lead single, Lil' Troy was picked up by Universal Music Group, which re-released his debut album in 1999 with a larger national distribution.

This album did not contain a charting single and did not fare nearly as well as his debut.  He released his third and to date last album, Paperwork, in 2006.
