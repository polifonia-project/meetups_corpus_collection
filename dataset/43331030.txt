=== 2011: Early live appearances ===

Morris gigged in Blackpool and around the North-West England during her college studies. She attracted the attention of BBC Radio Lancashire presenter Sean McGinty, who put her forward to perform on the BBC Introducing stage at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2011. She was signed to Universal Music Publishing Group the same month and to Atlantic Records in September 2011. Morris had received attention from other labels but chose Atlantic because they "would take it slow" and "didn't blow any smoke up my arse".During this period she was mentored by fellow Blackpool singer-songwriter Karima Francis, who helped develop her songwriting skills. She was also in a two-year relationship with Francis, which she said inspired the songs on her debut album "about going through that, exploring that sexuality and those feelings for the first time. Then coming out the other side of that as well, so that's the album".

Morris released her debut single in March 2012, "Don't Go", following its use in the final episode of the sixth series of the television drama series Skins. She recorded an EP, For You, which she sold exclusively at her live performances in mid 2012, and in November released a second EP, Grow. Another EP, From Above, followed in 2013.
