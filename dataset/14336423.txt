Tibor Harsányi (June 27, 1898 in Magyarkanizsa, Kingdom of Hungary – September 19, 1954 in Paris) was a Hungarian-born composer and pianist.
He studied at the Budapest Conservatory under Zoltán Kodály. He toured as a pianist around Europe and the Pacific, then settled in the Netherlands in 1920, and worked there as a pianist, conductor and composer before relocating to Paris in 1923. He helped to found the Société Triton, which organised concerts of contemporary music, and established ties with other expatriates, becoming one of the so-called Groupe des Quatre, along with Bohuslav Martinů, Marcel Mihalovici and Conrad Beck. He was also one of a related group of émigré composers known as the École de Paris, which helped bring him together with other colleagues from Central and Eastern Europe, such as Alexander Tansman and Alexander Tcherepnin.
