Interested in branching out from traditional DJing, Porter began working on video remixes of commercials and celebrities. One of these remixes was a music video called "Rap Chop", which remixed the Slap Chop infomercial using auto-tuning. Porter posted it to YouTube on April 25, 2009, and soon afterward the video went viral, garnering over 12 million views within two years. A Guardian article compared the video to the similar Cillit Bang remix, while Jason Lutz, in an article written for Billboard, compared Porter's mashup to similar viral video works by Mike Relm and The Gregory Brothers.In June, Porter released another remix entitled "Press Hop", which featured footage of basketball player Allen Iverson and his "practice" press conference, as well as a controversial rant by American football coach Mike Gundy. The "Press Hop" video was viewed over 3 million times.In July 2009, because of the success of the "Rap Chop" video, Porter partnered with Vince Offer to produce official commercials for Offer's products. Porter was also contracted by FedEx, and the "Press Hop" remix aired on ESPN. The "Press Hop" remix also helped Porter gain attention from other sports associations.


=== PorterHouse Media ===
Because of the success of his early remixes, Porter founded a production company, PorterHouse Media, in 2009. Porterhouse Media is a multi-media company based in Holyoke, Massachusetts. The company's main service is creating viral media remixes as advertisements for sports teams and leagues and television networks such as ESPN, ABC, and NBC. By 2012, the company had produced approximately 100 video remixes, each of which takes between 100 and 250 hours to create. Most of them are about 30 seconds long.In 2010, PorterHouse Media partnered with Goodby Silverstein & Partners to produce advertisements for the National Basketball Association's "Where Amazing Happens" campaign. They produced four commercial spots, "Where Defense Happens", "Where Clutch Happens", "Where Determination Happens", and "Where Stepping Up Happens", which each remixed footage of basketball players into rap songs. In the same year, PorterHouse Media also produced a series of advertisements for ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown and CBC Television's Hockey Night in Canada.
