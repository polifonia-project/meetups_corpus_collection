The rapper El-P recorded a freestyle over the track for Pitchfork TV.In the months following, online comedian and musician George Miller, known by his stage name Joji, recorded a video dancing to the song with his friends, which consequently grew into a YouTube viral video sensation as thousands of fans, artists, personalities and brands filmed their own versions to the track.
