== Life and career ==

Jessie Smith was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi, the daughter of Georgia and Israel Smith, and was raised in Alton, Illinois. She was a member of the Belle Street Temple Church Of God In Christ, under the leadership of Superintendent R.J. Monroe, and sang gospel solos and with choirs as a teenager. She was a part of The Monroe-Ettes, a female gospel group, with Missionary Norma Smith and Wanda Thompson.After winning a local talent show at the age of 16, she occasionally sang background vocals for such visiting musicians as Albert King and Ike Turner.  In 1961, she was recruited by bandleader Benny Sharp and his band the Zorros of Rhythm in St. Louis. Sharp's band included New Breed, a vocal trio consisting of Stacy Johnson, Vernon Guy, and Horise O'Toole. Backed by Sharp and his band, Smith released the single, "My Baby Has Gone" / "St. Louis Sunset Twist," on Chicago's Mel-O Records under the name Little Miss Jessie in 1961.By 1962, Smith, Johnson, and Guy had left Sharp to join the Ike & Tina Turner Revue which had relocated to Los Angeles. Smith along with Robbie Montgomery who she knew from St. Louis and Venetta Fields (a gospel singer from Buffalo, New York) formed the first official incarnation of the Ikettes. The revue toured throughout the country performing a grueling schedule of one-nighters. They performed at prominent venues such as the Apollo Theater in New York, the Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C., and the Uptown Theater in Philadelphia. As an Ikette, Smith performed on the American television shows American Bandstand, Hollywood A Go-Go, and Shindig!. Two of the Ikettes' biggest hits were released on Modern Records in 1965, "Peaches 'N' Cream" (Pop No. 36, R&B No. 28) and "I'm So Thankful" (Pop No. 74, R&B No. 12).Smith, Fields and Montgomery left the revue in 1965. Prevented by Turner from using the name Ikettes, they formed the Mirettes in 1966, named after their new label Mirwood Records. They released a few singles, including "In the Midnight Hour" (Pop No. 45, R&B No. 18) in 1968. After they disbanded, Smith continued to record as a backing vocalist in the 1970s, with singers including Al Kooper, Bryan Ferry, and Jose Feliciano. On occasion she teamed up with Robbie Montgomery for sessions, such as the recording of Dr. John's albums In The Right Place (1973), Triumvirate, (1973), and Desitively Bonnaroo (1974).After her R&B career, she settled in California, married Edward Lucas, and raised her family.
