Borgman and her elder sister was a student of Johan Fredrik Berwald. During the 1820s, she performed successfully with her sister (also a violinist) in concerts at tours in Gothenburg, Stockholm, Norway, Finland and in Saint Petersburg and Moscow in Russia.
She ended her career after her marriage to the then mayor of Stockholm, Johan Anders Biörck.
