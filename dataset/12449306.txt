== Career ==


=== Jenn Grant and Goodbye Twentieth Century ===
She performed as a musician for a time in her early teens, but stopped due to a bout of stage fright, and did not return to performing until her early 20s when she played some shows with The Heavy Blinkers. She then released an independent EP, Jenn Grant and Goodbye Twentieth Century, in 2005.


=== Orchestra for the Moon ===
She collaborated on her debut album, Orchestra for the Moon, with such artists as Ron Sexsmith, the Heavy Blinkers, Matt Mays and Jill Barber, and later toured Germany and Canada in support of the album, including as an opening act for The Weakerthans.


=== Echoes ===
She later began recording her second album, Echoes, on a farm in rural Ontario in 2008. The album was produced by Jonathan Goldsmith and engineered by Walter Sobczak at The Studio at Puck's Farm. Her voice was also featured in the song "We Made a Pact" by Hey Rosetta on their 2008 album Into Your Lungs (and around in your heart and on through your blood).

Honeymoon Punch is the third studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Jenn Grant, released January 7, 2011.

The album was recorded and produced by Grant's now husband Daniel Ledwell. The album was nominated for Adult Alternative Album of the Year at the 2012 Juno Awards.

=== Paradise ===
Grant's sixth album, Paradise, was released on March 3, 2017. Grant and husband Daniel Ledwell took a year in their home studio to craft an album of melodic beauty and sonic diversity.

=== Love, Inevitable ===
Grants seventh album, Love, Inevitable, was released on May 31, 2019. She began writing songs for the record in 2018. After making four consecutive albums with her husband, Daniel Ledwell garnering a cult following and critical acclaim, Grant stepped out of her usual comfort zone and reached out to Grammy nominated American producer and engineer, Tucker Martine. Grant wrote the tracks in her living room in Halifax using a Roland keyboard, acoustic guitar and banjo. She then flew to Portland, Oregon in July 2018 to record at Martine's Flora Recording and Playback.
