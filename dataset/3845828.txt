Vesa "Vesku" Jokinen (born 1970) is the lead singer in Finnish punk rock band Klamydia, based in Vaasa on the Finnish west coast, and in Kylähullut.
He and his friends in the band created the record label Kråklund Records in the beginning of the 1990s because they were unsatisfied with the big record companies.
He has also worked solo releasing the 2000 solo album called Outo Kunnia (meaning Strange honor in English). In 2012, he released a joint album with Sundin Pojat entitled Juuret.
