Quote from the USC publication Musicology at USC, A Handbook for Graduate Students 2007–2008:

The study of musicology at the University of Southern California has a long and excellent history.
Its founding and early development are intertwined with the remarkable career of Pauline Alderman (1893–1983). In 1930 she was appointed to the faculty of USC's "College of Music," where she taught primarily theory and composition. Her interests then turned to music history, and she left USC to study at the University of Edinburgh and later at the University of Strasbourg under the guidance of Yvonne Rokseth. Her researches were interrupted when war descended upon Europe, whereupon she returned to Los Angeles and to USC. Following the war she completed her dissertation, "Anthoine Boësset and the Air de Cour", for which she was awarded in 1946 the first Ph.D. degree in music at this university. She was the founder of the Department of Music History and Literature and its Chair from 1952 until her retirement in 1960. From then until her death in 1983, Pauline Alderman remained an inspiring presence in the lives of students and faculty at USC, and as guest lecturer at colleges and universities across the country.
In addition to her songs, Alderman composed an opera Bombasto Furioso (1938) and the operetta Come On Over (1940), which won the ASCAP Award for 1940, the first time the prize was won by a woman.
The International Congress on Women in Music sponsored by International Alliance for Women in Music has established the Pauline Alderman Award for musicological and journalistic works on women in music in 1982.Alderman’s students included composer Williametta Spencer.
