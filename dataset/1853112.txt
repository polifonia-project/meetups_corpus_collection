Jesus "Jesse" Ernesto Pintado Andrade (July 12, 1969 â€“ August 27, 2006) was a lead guitar player born in Mexico who at an early age moved to the US. He started in the grindcore band Terrorizer where he recorded the album World Downfall, the first album to feature Pete Sandoval who would later leave the band to join Morbid Angel. It was Jesse Pintado who coined the term "grindcore" for the first time (in 1983), to describe a musical mixture of "noise and chaos" which he was developing at that time.
He lived in Huntington Park, California (his home address was even on the booklet of the "World Downfall" CD for contacting), but moved to Birmingham, England after he joined Napalm Death, where he replaced guitarist Bill Steer immediately prior to the recording of their album Harmony Corruption.
In 2004 he officially left Napalm Death; instead of replacing him, the band has since continued as a four-piece. Pintado later revived Terrorizer, recruiting Tony Norman of Monstrosity and Anthony Rezhawk of Resistant Culture; he and Pete Sandoval were the only original members.
Besides Terrorizer and Napalm Death he also played in Lock Up and Brujeria (see discography below). Both bands also featured Napalm Death bass player Shane Embury.
His last residence was Ridderkerk in the Netherlands, and a few weeks after the release of Terrorizer's second album, he died in a hospital in the Netherlands due to liver failure after a diabetes-induced coma. His death also stemmed from excessive drinking.
