In 2005, Kola was signed to Box Fresh Pictures as a director alongside Anthony Mandler.

During the same time, Kola styled and modeled for the clothing line Billionaire Boys Club.Kola was asked to re-vamp the company of Island Def Jam as director of creative services in 2006. Antonio "L.A" Reid, president of Def Jam, said she would be "the one to keep the building cool, someone in tune with downtown cool and pop mainstream." That year Kola also started an monthly '90s party with her friend Oscar Sanchez called "1992". Playing only music from the late '80s and early '90s, the event brought out a mix of tastemakers and celebrities including Dave Chappelle, Jay-Z, Ne-Yo, Jermaine Dupri, Patrick Ewing, Redman, DJ Premier, The Clipse, Maxwell, Chanel Iman, Zoe Kravitz, Grand Puba, Lord Finesse, and KiD CuDi.

With an official debut in fall 2008, the clothing was described as "a mix of opposite worlds: uptown and downtown, hip-hop and rock, feminine and masculine, casual and couture". The following year, Vibe listed the "31 Most Stylish People Under 31" with Kola coming in at 23rd. She was also featured in Nylon as part of their lineup of "It Girls".
