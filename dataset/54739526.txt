Kevin Gordon is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, poet, and folk art collector from Louisiana. His songs draw from experiences growing up in the South, and have been recorded by Levon Helm, Keith Richards, Webb Wilder, and Irma Thomas.


== Biography ==


=== Early years ===
Gordon was raised in West Monroe, Louisiana, where he was exposed to blues, honky tonk and rockabilly. He started playing guitar and writing songs at age 17 or 18, and played in a punk band while in high school that performed Ramones and Sex Pistols covers.While Gordon was attending the University of Louisiana at Monroe, poet Jorie Graham encouraged Gordon to apply to the University of Iowa Writers Workshop, where he earned a master's degree in poetry. On weekends he began playing local gigs with Bo Ramsey. Gordon moved to Nashville in 1992 to work as a songwriter.

==== Carnival Time ====
Gordon's first album was Carnival Time in 1993, initially released on cassette and later reissued on CD. Gordon is joined by Ramsey (guitars), Steve Hayes (drums), Mike Murray and Rick Cicalo (bass), Mitchell Moss (fiddle, mandolin), Dave Moore (accordion), and Al Murphy (fiddle).


==== Cadillac Jack's #1 Son ====
E Street Band bassist Garry Tallent produced Gordon's 1997 EP Illinois 5 a.m. on the Motherlode label. Gordon and Gwil Owen co-wrote four songs for Gordon's 1998 album Cadillac Jack's #1 Son which was also produced by Tallent.

==== Gloryland ====
Gordon's 2012 release Gloryland was produced by Joe McMahan and supported by Scott Martin (drums), and Ryan Norris (keyboards) of Lambchop. A standout song is "Colfax" which related a childhood memory of a high school band and the KKK over 10 minutes of ever-changing music. Another highlight is "Pecolia's Star," a duet with Sarah Siskind about folk artist Pecolia Warner.
