He primarily releases his music through Hospital Records, the UK-based independent drum and bass music label.  His DJ name was Spyder, but two months before the release of his first track he had to change it because another producer from America also released an EP under the same name.  He left the last three letters out and changed his name to S.P.Y or SPY.
