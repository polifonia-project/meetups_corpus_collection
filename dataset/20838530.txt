At age 14, she recorded her first song, produced by Idan Raichel, who later went on to become a successful mainstream world-music producer. She officially changed name to Ocher at age 18. In December 2006, she formed a band, Mary and The Baby Cheeses, in Tel Aviv, and in October of the following year, the band moved to Berlin, where she would later change the entire line-up. The band produced several DIY releases, the most notable being a collection of studio recordings titled Analog music for a digital generation. In December 2008, she released a solo album recording titled War Songs, with 13 acoustic apocalyptic folk songs about war, crime and other related themes.
In mid-2009, she took part in Voices – a fundraiser event for Physicians for Human Rights in Gaza organized by Eleanor Cantor aka Sister Chain and a small group of volunteers, that was held twice at Filmbuehne in Berlin and once more on 10 May 2010 in the city of Muenster.
In January 2011, she joined the German Indie band 1000 Robota, on the 2nd leg of their German tour.
The re-issue of War Songs by the German label "Haute Areal" came out in Germany, Spain, Switzerland and Austria on 11 March 2011, and its first single, "On the Streets of Hard Labor" had been released two weeks prior, on 25 February 2011.

In early 2012 she was invited to perform music for the production of Maxim Gorki Theater's adaptation of Sven Regener's book "Der Kleine Bruder" ("The Little Brother"), directed by Milan Peschel, but she was fired for creative differences.
And on 30 June 2012 she played the most notorious of German festivals, the Fusion festival.
Also in June 2012, she was asked to join Ned Collette + Wirewalker's Australian tour.
In October 2012, Ocher went on tour with the German bestseller author Sibylle Berg, alongside actors Katja Riemann and Matthias Brandt to promote Berg's new book Vielen dank für das Leben ("Many Thanks for Life"). The tour visited most large German cities, as well as Zurich (Switzerland), and it was entirely sold-out. Along the shows, a video was made for the song "The final embrace (Toto's song)" (Toto is the main character in the book, of which Ocher resonates on stage).

The second vinyl edition of the album includes the bonus tracks Lullaby for a murderer and Poor boy from the wild lands. Owing to the unusual number of videos that were made for the album, they were released once a week, for two months. The music video for "Baby Indiana" featured King Khan, Jessie Evans, Drop Dead festival's Polina Y and Art Stars' Nadja Sayej.
EDEN ranked No. 12 in Intro Magazine's list of Albums of The Year of 2013.In November 2013 Ocher joined forces with German avant-garde poet/songwriter Hans Unstern and the Great Hans Unstern Swindle for a wide German/Austrian tour.

In the summertime the crowdfunding campaign for Ocher's debut album with Your Government was launched, it featured a series of episodes of Between Two Drummers, a friendly nod to Between Two Ferns. some of the guests were Nina Hynes, Ned Collette and Molly Nilsson.

On January 7, 2016, the debut full-length album with Your Government was released on legendary krautrock/experimental label Klangbad (led by Faust (band)'s Hans Joachim Irmler). Its follow-up "The West Against The People" was recorded at the Faust Studio with Irmler in the summer of 2016 and released on March 10, 2017. The album features an essay analyzing the current sociopolitical climate, as well as solo tracks, tracks with Your Government and collaborations with Die Toedliche Doris and Felix Kubin. A special edition of the album grants access to further tracks that were revealed gradually throughout 2017.
The release of "The West Against The People" was announced in January 2017 in Fact, with the tag line:

The video for "Arms" caused a minor controversy with its imagery of Israeli soldiers wandering casually in public spaces with big guns, it was nominated for a MuVi award at Oberhausen film festival (2017), and selected for the Cologne Women's Film Festival (2018).
Before the end of 2017 further recordings were released in the form of "The Faust Studio Sessions and Other Recordings" (on 10" and on tape for her 2018 North American tour(s)). She has performed in over 20 countries with the two releases in 2017, and still counting.
