=== L.A. Guns (1983–1985) ===

L.A. Guns were first formed in 1983 by guitarist Tracii Guns and drummer Rob Gardner. The first lineup included Guns, Beich, Gardner and singer Michael Jagosz. The band recorded an EP Collector's Edition No. 1. Shortly after, Jagosz left the band following an arrest involving a bar fight and was replaced by Bill Bailey (who would later change his name to Axl Rose). Bailey had previously fronted Rapidfire with Kevin Lawrence and Hollywood Rose with Izzy Stradlin and Chris Weber. Jagosz came back after Rose left playing with the band for 2 weeks and for 5 shows.When L.A. Guns was reformed in 1985, Beich was replaced by Mick Cripps.


=== Guns N' Roses (1985) ===

Hollywood Rose reformed for a New Year's Eve show on New Year's Eve 1984, with Rose, Stradlin, Guns, Gardner and Steve Darrow. In March 1985 L.A. Guns merged with Hollywood Rose, changing their name to Guns N' Roses (combining the names of L.A. Guns and Hollywood Rose) with the lineup composed of Rose, Guns, Stradlin, Beich and Gardner.After only two rehearsals, Beich was fired from the band. He was replaced by Duff McKagan. Tracii Guns left the group; he was replaced by Slash. McKagan went on to book shows taking place between Sacramento and Seattle, which was dubbed “The Hell Tour“. During this time, Gardner quit the group and was replaced by Steven Adler. Rose, Stradlin, McKagan, Slash, and Adler became known as the "classic lineup" of Guns N' Roses.


== Death ==
Beich died on October 16, 1991, drowning in Sankt Jørgens Lake in the center of Copenhagen. Not long before, on August 19, Guns N' Roses had performed in the city.  His family believed that he became depressed after leaving Guns N' Roses in 1985 and was heavily abusing drugs before returning to Denmark in 1988.  Heroin, and a blood alcohol content of .148, are thought to have contributed to his drowning, but his family still believes it was suicide.Beich is buried in Esbjerg next to his father Aksel, who died in 1995.
