== Bio ==
Wright's career in mainstream rock first took off when he joined Giuffria in 1984. Their debut album Giuffria peaked at #26 on the Billboard album charts on March 2, 1985. The album spawned two hit singles, "Call to the Heart" (Hot 100 #15) and "Lonely In Love" (Hot 100 #57). After sold-out arena tours with Deep Purple and Foreigner, Wright left Giuffria to re-join Quiet Riot in 1986, replacing Rudy Sarzo, recording and writing songs for their QRIII release and supporting world tour.
His reputation as one of the most sought-after bass players has landed him gigs with Alice Cooper, Slash, Gregg Allman, Carmine Appice, Ronnie Montrose, John Waite, and Pat Travers. Wright has appeared on over 90 worldwide record releases, playing bass and producing albums of various styles, including ambient trance, reggae, rap, country and rock.
He was also involved in seven film scores, including Kull the Conqueror, where he was joined by Guns N' Roses drummer Matt Sorum and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Over the years, Wright also worked with House of Lords, Bad Moon Rising, Blackthorne, Christian Tolle Project, Doro, Impellitteri, Kuni, MSG, Magdalen, Murderer's Row, Pata, Stephen Pearcy, Adler's Appetite, Love/Hate, Ken Tamplin, and Shane Gibson from Korn. Wright has headed Ultimate Jam Night, a long-running live music show since January 2015 at the Whisky A Go Go in Hollywood. Ultimate Jam Night features up to 60 pro musicians each week.
Wright continued to tour with Quiet Riot until 2021, when Rudy Sarzo returned to the band. Currently, he records as a session player, performs live with various rock acts, and is working on his debut solo album. He is endorsed by Ampeg, Godin Guitars, CAD Microphones and Sick Boy Motorcycles and signed by Cleopatra Records.
