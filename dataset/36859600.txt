By the age of 14, a growing love of the genre led Koromah to experiment with rapping himself. Early in his career Maxsta went by the name Macksta. His music was heard by several other MCs in London, including the rapper Godâ€™s Gift, part of the grime collective Mucky Wolfpack, based in Bow. This led him to join the group.

It was a commercial success, selling out in the first few days. Shortly afterwards, Koromah performed at T in the Park 2010.However, in response to the lyrical content in his music, Koromah suffered several physical assaults, including one incident in which he was stabbed.
