Andy Manson is a custom guitar maker (luthier). For almost five decades Manson has been hand crafting guitars, mandolins and multi-necked instruments. Over the years Manson has achieved a reputation as one of England's finest luthiers and one of the world's finest makers of flat-top acoustic guitars, and his influence can be seen in many other makers' work including Hugh's and Brook Guitars and other small makers such as Adrian Lucas, Elysian Acoustics and Gary Nava.


== History ==
Manson studied at the London College of Furniture, where he completed a new course for stringed instrument makers. Such a course did not exist in England at the time and Manson was encouraged by the college to create his own course on becoming a luthier. He built his first instrument in 1967. Manson started a workshop in 1969 in Sussex, UK.
In the early 1980s, Manson was joined by his brother Hugh Manson, who focused on building electric guitars and basses. The two of them moved workshop to Devon, England in 1985.
Andy Petherick and Simon Smidmore, former associates of Andy Manson's, went on to found Brook Guitars, where they produce some of his regular designs under licence.


== Notable works ==
In 1974, Manson created a now iconic instrument for John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin. The instrument featured three necks: six and 12 string guitar and mandolin. The instrument was used extensively during Led Zeppelin's acoustics sets throughout the mid to late 70's. The story of the creation of this guitar can be found in Manson's book Talking Wood. Jones has continued using Manson through the years.
In 1994, Manson was commissioned to make a triple-neck guitar for Jimmy Page. It was used during the Unledded performances.
