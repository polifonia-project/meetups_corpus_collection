=== 2013: Britain's Got Talent ===
In his Britain's Got Talent audition, screened on 26 May, Gabz performed an original song called "The One". When asked beforehand what the song was about, Gabz stated that it was about "losing the love of your life". Gabz received praise from the judges, with Simon Cowell stating, "I absolutely loved that. I really did. I think that's a cute little song, great chorus, you know, produced properly that song... you may have something there." Gabz received four "yes" votes from the judges and was put through to the next round, and subsequently the semi-finals. In the semi-final on 28 May, Gabz performed the song again, this time with a backing track and choir. Amanda Holden likened Gabz to a young Lily Allen. Walliams urged Cowell to make the song available for purchase, predicting it could make number one in the UK Singles Chart. Gabz landed in the top three of the night, and with comedian Jack Carroll already through, it was down to the judges to choose between Gardiner and Irish singers Jack and Cormac. All four judges voted for Gabz, thus sending him through to the final.
It was Gabz's idea to audition, and that his father almost refused to let Gabz audition because of his bad attitude at home, and required Gabz to get better, and eventually let him after the deadline was extended. Gabz also stated that "It would be amazing to win – I'm not expecting it – I don't think I will. I'm really really happy to get this far, I can't believe it, it's great, I'm just hoping I can get a record deal or something so I can show more of my songs – I've written over 30 now." Gabz' hometown also saw support, with banners supplied by businesses around his hometown.In the final, Gabz performed a mash-up of a new song "Lie There" and "The One". Gabz finished in seventh place with 3.6% of the vote.
