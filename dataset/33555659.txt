The Rönninge Show Chorus is an all-female, a cappella chorus based in Rönninge, Sweden.


== History ==
Founded in 1983, the Rönninge Show Chorus is one of the largest and most successful a cappella choruses in Scandinavia.  Singing music primarily in the barbershop style, they are affiliated with Sweet Adelines International (SAI), the world's largest all-female singing organization with over 25,000 members worldwide. Rönninge have represented Sweden in SAI's international chorus competition for over 20 years, never placing lower than 6th in the world. They are the 2014 SAI international gold medal chorus, having achieved that honor at the 2013 contest in Honolulu, HI, with a score of 3138 out of a possible 3280. This was the highest ever score and also the first time a non-North American chorus had won the competition.
