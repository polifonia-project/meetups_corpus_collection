== Career ==
Brandtsegg studied music at the "Sund folkehøgskole" (Sund Folk High School) in Inderøy. He studied the vibraphone at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and created a music software program called ImproSculpt, which samples different tones from the environment (including via body sensors) at the same time the music is performed, processes them and generates ever-changing variations in real time. He plays an instrument called the Marimba Lumina, a MIDI-based marimba which allows the players movements affect the sound.
Brandtsegg led his own rock band as young in Steinkjer, and played with fellow students in the bands Krøyt from 1993, and later the Live Maria Roggen Band. He collaborated with Motorpsycho on commissioned work at the Trondheim Jazz Festival in 2006.
