== Early life ==
Nutini was born in Paisley, Scotland, and has a younger sister. His father, Alfredo, is a Scot of Italian descent from Barga in Tuscany, while his mother, Linda, is Scottish. He was expected to follow his father into the family fish and chip shop business. As a child he attended PACE Youth Theatre. He was first encouraged to sing by his music-loving grandfather, Giovanni "Jackie" Nutini, and a teacher at his school, St Andrews Academy, who recognised his talent.
Nutini left school to work as a roadie and to sell t-shirts for Scottish band Speedway. He spent three years learning the music business and performing live. He later worked as a studio hand at Glasgow's Park Lane Studio. It was here where he started demo-ing songs, writing with Jim Duguid and the drummer of Speedway.His big chance came when his younger family member signed him up to his first live show 102.5 Clyde 1 for David Sneddon's return to his home town of Paisley at the beginning of 2003. Sneddon was delayed, and as the winner of an impromptu pop quiz, Nutini was given the chance to perform a couple of songs on stage during the wait. The favourable reaction of the crowd impressed another member of the audience, Brendan Moon, who offered to become his manager with his business partner, Mike Bawden. Mike Bawden continues to manage Nutini.At 17, Nutini moved to London and performed regularly at The Bedford pub in Balham with local Singer-Songwriter Charlie Wallis. Other radio and live appearances followed, including two live acoustic spots on Radio London, The Hard Rock Cafe, and support slots for The Rolling Stones, Amy Winehouse and KT Tunstall. Nutini became known for singing with his eyes closed during his entire performances.


== Career ==


=== These Streets (2005–2007) ===
 
Nutini made his first demo which saw him signed to Atlantic Records in May 2005, shortly after his 18th birthday. He released his first single "These Streets" as a free download in May 2006; this was then followed by his next single "Last Request" which was released on 4 July 2006 and charted at number five on the UK Singles Chart.
In the video for "Last Request", Nutini plays the part of a robber – though this is not revealed until the end.
Nutini's third single, "Jenny Don't Be Hasty", was released on 25 September 2006 and got to number twenty on the UK Singles Chart. "Rewind" was Nutini's fourth single. It was released on 4 December 2006, and reached number twenty seven on the UK Singles Chart.
Nutini's debut album These Streets, produced by Ken Nelson (who has also worked with Coldplay and Gomez), was released on 17 July 2006 and immediately entered the UK album charts at number three. Many of the songs on the album, including "Last Request" and "Rewind", were inspired by a turbulent relationship with his former girlfriend Teri Brogan, and "Jenny Don't Be Hasty" is a true story about encounters with an older woman.
Commenting on These Streets, Nutini himself states on his official website, "The album is a little glimpse of some of the experiences I have been through in the last three years". In late 2007, Nutini covered Labi Siffre's "It Must Be Love" for BBC Radio 1's Radio 1 Established 1967 album.
Throughout 2006, Nutini played a number of sold-out concerts across Britain and performed at a wide variety of venues worldwide, including King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow, a TV appearance on Later with Jools Holland, Carnegie Hall in New York, The Montreux Jazz Festival, The Wireless Festival, Oxegen and T in the Park. He supported the Rolling Stones in Vienna and was invited to appear with them again at the Don Valley Stadium in August 2006 and was also booked to appear at the V Festival and The Austin City Limits Music Festival, Texas, later in 2006, with a European tour in the autumn. In May 2006, Nutini also played at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Dundee.
Nutini performed at the Glastonbury Festival in June 2007 on the famous Pyramid Stage on the second day of the event. Nutini also performed at the British leg of Live Earth at Wembley Stadium on 7 July 2007, with his set including a cover of "What A Wonderful World", a classic pop tune by Bob Thiele, George David Weiss, and George Douglas. He performed the following day at T in the Park, in Scotland. He performed at the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert on 10 December 2007, an event that drew enormous international attention as it was the first full live concert performance by Led Zeppelin in 27 years. Scottish independent TV company Volt MediaFix made a one-off documentary of Nutini's US tour. The programme, for the BBC, was scheduled for broadcast on BBC2, on Thursday 7 June throughout Scotland and on Sky channel 990 throughout the rest of Britain.


=== Sunny Side Up (2009–2011) ===

On 1 June 2009, Nutini released his second studio album Sunny Side Up, which debuted at number one. The first single from the album, "Candy", was released on 25 May. In July, he appeared on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, performing "Coming Up Easy". This was released as the second single to the album on 10 August and it debuted at number 62 in the UK Singles Chart on 16 August 2009. On 10 September 2009, Nutini performed "Coming Up Easy" on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. The third single from the album was "Pencil Full of Lead".
The album received a mixed critical reception. Some noted the move away from the sound of the debut album. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph was also positive, stating "his joyous second album organically blends soul, country, folk and the brash, horny energy of ragtime swing." Some reviewers were less impressed. It was described by The Guardian's Caroline Sullivan as "not bad", with opening track "10/10" described as "jaunty enough to make you retch".The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with sales of over 60,000 copies, fighting off strong competition from Love & War, the debut album of fellow male solo artist Daniel Merriweather. The album performed similarly well on the Irish Albums Chart, debuting at number two behind Eminem's new album before rising to the top of the charts the week after. The album has been one of the best UK album sales of the year. On the UK Albums Chart on the week of Monday 19 October, the album went from number 31 to number 5, making the album sell more than The Saturdays' second album. On 3 January 2010 Sunny Side Up topped the UK Album Charts for a second time, making the album the first Number one album in the United Kingdom of 2010 and the decade.
