Ça plane pour moi which gained success all over the world).

=== Latin American influence ===
Francis Goya has always admired Latin American music. In 1991, he decided to record, concurrently with instrumental music, a CD containing Brazilian songs (Bahia Lady). The timbre of his voice and passionate guitar-playing turned out to be a marvelous combination, and the public liked it.
He decided to continue working in this way, and, in 1992 and 1993 released two new albums of the same style (Noche Latino and Festival Latino).
1994 was the year for “going back to the roots”, for releasing a new CD of instrumental music, and for a tour of over fifty concerts in the Netherlands.

The first concert was such a success that Francis Goya had to prolong his stay in Estonia and give a second concert on the following day in the same Philharmonic Hall.
After such first experience in Estonia, Francis Goya decided to record an instrumental album that included pieces by the great Estonian composer Raimond Valgre.
That album was also a huge success in Estonia.

Francis Goya Foundation Archived 19 April 2012 at the Wayback Machine : Art and music for destitute children all over the world.(dead link)

Throughout his entire long career as a composer and a musician, Francis Goya has always taken part in charity campaigns aimed at collecting donations for the financing of orphanages and secondary schools in Cambodia, the department of urgent pediatrics of the Queen Fabiola Hospital (l’Hôpital Reine Fabiola) in Belgium, and Saint Michel Oncological Foundation in Brussels. When Francis Goya moved, a long time ago, to Morocco he saw that development of Moroccan young population needs support.
A brilliant idea occurred to him when he was traveling over the south regions of the country. He was playing the guitar, with his family around him, at a bivouac near a small village, when suddenly a crowd of children ringed round him and started listening too.
The idea was developed further: Francis decided to establish a Foundation for revealing of new talents among children and teenagers from “problem” regions and helping them develop their musical talents.
To establish the Francis Goya Foundation Archived 19 April 2012 at the Wayback Machine, support has been received from Francis Goya's Moroccan and European friends, who share the same values. The approach consists in arranging free concerts in order to collect funds to buy musical instruments and to finance singing and dancing classes for children. Schools, orphanages, and mountain regions are visited in order to discover young talents who would benefit from serious musical classes and gain and opportunity of studying abroad, and to find those who need long-term control and assistance.
“When life is generous to us, there comes time to give and time to serve – the more so, because music makes hearts warmer.
Today is an important day: we are laying the first stone to the base of the edifice, and we would like to use this opportunity to appeal to generosity of the donators for the financing of our ambitious projects, such as donation of musical instruments or taking the charge of conducting
artistic classes for children and teenagers from “problem” regions (such as orphanages, hospitals, douars).
I would like to thank you in advance for the coverage and publicity that you can give to this good initiative” – the speech of Francis Goya, President of the Francis Goya Foundation Archived 19 April 2012 at the Wayback Machine
Francis Goya has over 40 album releases to his credit.
