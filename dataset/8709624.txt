Sarah Brendel is a Folk/Pop singer from Dresden, Germany. She has achieved success in Germany and internationally, releasing an album with Franklin, Tennessee-based Inpop Records in 2005. Her song "Be With You" spent two weeks on the German singles chart in 2002 and peaked at No. 86. She is part of the Zeichen der Zeit (Sign of the Times) project alongside artists such as Xavier Naidoo and Yvonne Catterfeld. This project proved to be her break after it landed on top 10 German album charts. As well, her song "Fire" reached number 86 on the American Billboard airplay charts.
One of Brendel's musical influences early in her career was Larry Norman. In 2008 Norman recorded his two last songs with her: "Back to the Dust" and "Walking Backwards" appear on Brendel's record Early Morning hours. The song "Take My Heart" from her self-titled album appeared in the movie The Poet. CCM magazine praised that album's excellent lyrics.
