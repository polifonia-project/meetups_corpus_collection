== Biography ==
Bobby King was born in Jefferson County, Arkansas, United States. He was inspired by the work of Fenton Robinson and Larry Davis, before his relocation to Chicago, Illinois, following a short spell in 1959 in St. Louis, Missouri. He became a local favorite largely operating in the West Side, Chicago blues clubs, before his second single, "What a Day, What a Night" (1964), brought him to a larger audience.King's jazz styled guitar work saw him used as a session musician, recording behind blues musicians such as Lee "Shot" Williams, Eddy Clearwater and Freddie King.  He also toured, backing both Bobby Bland and Hank Ballard. His debut single, "Thanks Mr. Postman", an answer song to "Please Mr. Postman", had been released by Federal Records in 1962. Two other singles followed on small local labels, but none attracted tangible sales.In 1975, his debut album release, Chaser, a live recording, was issued on the French label MCM Records. King wrote two of the songs, including the title track. In 1977, an article on King appeared in the Blues Unlimited magazine.King planned to undertake a tour of Europe and Japan, but a violent quarrel arose at Louise's, a Chicago club, which left King badly injured and unable to play the guitar. He subsequently died from his wounds on July 22, 1983. An obituary appeared in Living Blues magazine (issue No. 58) later that year.King's work has appeared on a number of compilation albums.  These include King New Breed Rhythm & Blues (2002) which incorporated "Thanks Mr. Postman", R&B Hipshakers Vol. 3: Just a Little Bit of the Jumpin' Bean (2012), and The R & B Singles Collection Volume 2 (2013).
