Shortly afterward, she began performing with Jedd Hughes as the short-lived duo Buxton Hughes before forming Skyline Motel.


== Biography ==
Buxton was born in Lawrence, Kansas. She became actively involved in music as a child by learning piano, playing flute and joining a children's choir. As she learned more about music, she became interested in songwriters and began writing poetry. After graduation, she met one of her musical idols, Stevie Nicks, who encouraged her to pursue music and move to Nashville, Tennessee.Buxton enrolled at Nashville's Belmont University and started a Southern rock band called Stoik Oak, which toured the region for three years. After an 18-month engagement, she married Christopher Robin of the Christopher Robin Band when she was 22. However, they divorced shortly afterwards. She also felt discouraged about finding a place for her voice in the music business but found further encouragement from one of her friends, John Rich of Big & Rich. She asked her publisher to set up some co-writing sessions, and she became more confident in her approach to singing and songwriting. In the meantime, she sang background vocals for Kenny Rogers and John Corbett, in addition to singing duet vocals on Cowboy Troy's "If You Don't Wanna Love Me".

It was followed by "That Kind of Day", which reached number 26 in 2007. Both were included on a five-song digital extended play entitled Almost My Record, released only to digital retailers in mid-2007. Among the tracks on this EP were "Love Is a Trip", which was used by ABC to promote its Men in Trees drama series, and Buxton's own rendition of "Stupid Boy".In mid-2008, Buxton recorded a duet with Dierks Bentley, entitled "Sweet & Wild", on his greatest hits album Greatest Hits/Every Mile a Memory 2003-2008. This song reached number 51 on the country music charts as an album cut, although only Bentley received chart credit for it.Buxton released "Space", which she wrote with Lari White and Chuck Cannon, in October 2008. It peaked at number 38 in early 2009 and was added to Almost My Record. A fourth single, "Outside My Window", was issued in June 2009 and remained on the charts until February 2010, peaking at number 23.

== Musical styles ==
Stewart Mason of Allmusic wrote that Buxton has "an appealingly hoarse singing voice akin to Melissa Etheridge and a no-nonsense lyrical persona somewhat along the lines of Gretchen Wilson." Almost My Record received a positive review from Country Standard Time critic Michael Sudhalter, who said that "Stupid Boy" worked better from a female's perspective, and that "Innocence" was "one of the best songs about reminiscing of young love since Deana Carter's 'Strawberry Wine'." Jessica Phillips of Country Weekly magazine wrote in her review of the album that Buxton's lyrics cast her as "a typical 20-something-year-old girl in America."

Buxton became engaged to session guitarist Tom Bukovac on December 20, 2009. They married on November 20, 2010. She gave birth to their first child, Marshall, on December 4, 2012. Their second son, Leo, was born in 2016.
