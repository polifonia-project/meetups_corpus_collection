Nils Landgren (born 15 February 1956) is a Swedish R&B, funk, and jazz trombone player and singer. He is known as The Man with the Red Horn because he plays a red trombone.


== Career ==

Landgren was born in Degerfors. Between 1972 and 1978 he studied classical trombone at the music college in Karlstad, Sweden, and continued his education at the university of Arvika. After meeting the Swedish folk-jazz pioneer Bengt-Arne Wallin and trombonist Eje Thelin, Landgren was persuaded to move from his strictly classical studies to improvisation and to begin developing his own sound and approach to music.After his graduation, Landgren moved to Stockholm to work as a professional trombone player. He was soon touring with Swedish pop star Björn Skifs. Skifs's band, Blue Swede, recorded a number one hit song in the U.S. pop charts with Hooked on a Feeling. In 1981, Thad Jones invited Landgren to join his big band, called Ball of Fire, as the lead trombonist. Landgren has worked in many genres: jazz, rock, soul, hip hop, and big band. By his own reckoning, he has contributed to at least 500 albums by such international groups and musicians as ABBA, The Crusaders, Eddie Harris, Bernard "Pretty" Purdie, Wyclef Jean, and Herbie Hancock. 
In 1983, he recorded and released his debut album as a solo artist, Planet Rock. It was followed by Streetfighter (1984), You Are My Number One (1985), Miles from Duke (1987) with Bengt-Arne Wallin, Chapter Two 1 (1987), Chapter Two 2 and Follow Your Heart (1989). Between 1985 and 1987, Landgren performed as an actor, singer, trombonist, and dancer in over 360 performances of SKÅL, the Swedish play of the year. He has also appeared in several TV-films as an actor.In 1992, the first performances and recordings of the Nils Landgren Unit took place. Its breakthrough beyond Scandinavia occurred in 1994 at the Jazz Baltica Festival at Salzau, Germany. The group then became the Nils Landgren Funk Unit. The album Live in Stockholm was released that year and was the foundation for the collaboration with Siegfried Loch and his then nascent label ACT Music.In 2006, Landgren organized a Christmas With My Friends concert in the Odensala Church in Stockholm which was recorded and released as an album. It became the first album in a series.  Landgren has released a new Christmas With My Friends album accompanied by a Christmas season tour in Sweden or Germany every other year.In September 2007 Landgren opened the Jazz It Up Shanghai Jazz Festival with his band Funk Unit, playing a swing party, funk jazz show at the He Luting Concert Hall of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music.
