=== 2005–2007: Destiny Line, early work, and career debut ===

It was reported that there were 2 million Google hits within an entire year, with the majority of the viewers being located in China and Japan.

It was her first magazine cover in nearly two years. On October 31, 2010, she announced that she and Bun had separated and filed for divorce earlier that month, and she was seeking full custody of their child. According to Dizon, the split was due to "busy schedules and inability to meet regularly differing opinions toward raising children" alongside "irreconcilable differences".
