Nyam Nyam were a post-punk band from Hull, England, who formed in 1979. Their first single was "When We Canâ€™t Make the Laughter Stay" (1981), which brought them to the attention of Peter Hook of New Order, who produced their second single "Fate/Hate" (Factory Benelux, 1984). The band then signed to Beggars Banquet affiliate label Situation Two, who released their sole album Hope of Heaven (1984) as well as a final EP, "The Architect" (1985).Although critically well-received, the records did not sell in large numbers, and Nyam Nyam were dropped.
The band's record sleeves were designed by Vaughan Oliver of 23 Envelope and 4AD.
The album, with most of their single tracks, was remastered and reissued by LTM Recordings in 2012, with one new 2012 recording, "Doubt".
