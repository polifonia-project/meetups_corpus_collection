At 17, she decided that she wanted to start her own band.


== Music career ==


=== Jack Off Jill (1992–2000) ===

Jessica Fodera met Tenni Arslanyan while attending high school in Sunrise, Florida. She added the "K" to the original spelling of her first name and dropped her surname, paying homage to Magick (Book 4), by Aleister Crowley. They had begun writing songs, but had not yet formed a complete band when Robin Moulder and Michelle Oliver joined them to create the band Jack In Jill. In 1992, Jack In Jill got their start when they were asked to open for fellow Floridian Marilyn Manson and his band, Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids at a Davie, Florida nightclub called The Plus 5 Lounge. Manson suggested a name change to Jack Off Jill (JOJ). In 1993, JOJ released their first recording titled, "Children 5 And Up", produced by Marilyn Manson. In early 1993, Jessicka performed with Manson's ephemeral side project, Mrs. Scabtree and shared vocal duties with then boyfriend Jeordie White.
In December 1994 while on tour, Jessicka spent a night in jail when she and Manson were arrested after a concert in Jacksonville, Florida, for breaking the town's adult entertainment codes. They both spent one night in jail. Charges were dropped.Before her 21st birthday, Jessicka's record label, Rectum Records, had released several independent JOJ records and several 7" singles. Jack Off Jill signed with Los Angeles-based Risk Records in January 1997. The band released their first full-length album, Sexless Demons and Scars, in September 1997 then toured in the U.S. and Canada. In July 2000, JOJ released their second full-length CD, Clear Hearts, Grey Flowers, just as their label was preparing to close down.JOJ officially went on hiatus in late 2000, after playing a show at Los Angeles' The Troubadour in April 2000. They were joined onstage by guitarist Helen Storer of the UK band Fluffy and producer Chris Vrenna on drums.

=== Scarling. (2002–present) ===

After taking a break from the music industry and making Los Angeles her permanent residence, Jessicka was invited in 2001 by guitarist Christian Hejnal to be a guest vocalist on his solo album. The pair had only met a few months earlier through a mutual friend, Lisa Leveridge. They began recording and rehearsing together and eventually recruited the musicians who would form the first and very short-lived lineup of Scarling. In early 2002 Jessicka was introduced to Long Gone John, owner of Sympathy for the Record Industry, by mutual friend Mark Ryden. In March 2003 Scarling.'s debut single, "Band Aid Covers the Bullet Hole", was released on John's label. The cover featured an illustration entitled "Wound 39" by artist Mark Ryden.

Scarling. was invited to join the lineup of the Robert Smith-curated Curiosa Festival, performing on select West Coast dates alongside Jessicka's long-time favorite band The Cure. Three weeks before joining the tour, drummer Samantha Maloney filled in and was soon replaced by Beth Gordon.Smith described the band's music as "dark, desperate, chaotic, gorgeous pop music, the sound of the end of the world", and Scarling.'s Sweet Heart Dealer was nominated for the 2004 Shortlist Music Prize.After a series of 7" singles on Sympathy, Scarling. announced in early 2005 that their second album, So Long, Scarecrow, would appear later that year; it was preceded by the single "We are the Music Makers" and was released in August 2005. So Long, Scarecrow was co-produced by Rob Campanella and received several favorable reviews. Alternative Press' Jason Pettigrew gave the album a 5 out of 5 rating. Simon Price from The Independent said, "Fodera has always had a knack for acronyms and catchphrases,'Manorexic' is one which will be lapped up by the goth kids, but her intriguing lyrics, sung in a voice pitched midway between Kate Bush sweetness and Siouxsie Sioux stridency, cut deeper than mere punning." The song Bummer a track from SLS was featured on Showtime's The L Word season 3 episode "Latecomer". In December 2005, Scarling. embarked on its first UK tour. In 2006 Jessicka continued to tour in the US and Europe with Scarling., touring with such bands as UK shoegaze band Amusement Parks on Fire and opening for The Wedding Present and Depeche Mode. In 2006, Scarling. released their fourth single Staring to the Sun. The album cover featured a portrait of Jessicka done by Los Angeles photographer Piper Ferguson.On May 13, 2014, Mark Ryden released an album entitled 'The Gay Nineties Old Tyme Music: Daisy Bell,' that features Scarling. along with other artists all giving a different rendition of the same song, 'Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two).'The album, printed on 180 g red vinyl, was limited to 999 copies, all hand-numbered and signed by Ryden. Half of the records were to be sold at the Michael Kohn Gallery. The proceeds from the record, will benefit Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit that supports musical education in disadvantaged elementary schools.
