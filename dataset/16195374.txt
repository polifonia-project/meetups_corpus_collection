The album was later renamed 2Sides. Derulo explains the reason why he changed the album's name, saying:

"777 was a stage in my life and it has taken a long time to do this album but this name, 2Sides, is more poignant to where I think I am now in my life and what I think the album exudes - the light and the dark side of who I am - the album exemplifies that in both ways.
"People have never seen the urban side of what I do as well so they’ll get to see that side for the first time. It's an album that has so many different faces so 2Sides was the more appropriate title."
"Goodbye", a joint-collaboration with David Guetta and featuring Nicki Minaj and Willy William, was released on August 24, 2018. In 2019, Derulo released the singles "Let's Shut Up & Dance" with Lay Zhang and NCT 127 on February 22, "Mamacita", featuring Farruko, on July 5, and "Too Hot" on August 27.In a telephone interview with the Official Charts Company, Derulo revealed that he will release "a seven-track EP and then another one shortly after", and that his previous singles "Swalla", "If I'm Lucky", "Tip Toe", and "Goodbye" will not be included on this project because "those songs have had their time. Even though putting them on an album would make it go platinum in two seconds, it’s not about the numbers. These are brand new songs, brand new vibes." Side 1, the first part of 2Sides, was released on November 8, 2019; with Part 2 arriving in 2020. Derulo stars as Rum Tum Tugger in the film Cats, which premiered on December 20, 2019.
