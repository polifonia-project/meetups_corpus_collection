In the 1990s, Nevins began releasing singles under various monikers through every big underground dance label, but achieved global recognition in 1998 with his production of Run–D.M.C.'s "It's Like That" which was released under the title 'Run–DMC vs. Jason Nevins', reaching number-one on the pop chart in over 30 countries, with close to 5 million worldwide sales and over 1 million in sales in both Germany and the United Kingdom. In the UK, the single also halted the Spice Girls' (then record) run of six consecutive number ones with their first six singles, holding the Spice Girls' seventh release, "Stop", at number 2.  It's Like That was the 3rd highest selling single of 1998 in the UK behind Believe by Cher and My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion.
