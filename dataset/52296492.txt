Cameron independently released his debut album, Jumping the Shark, for free on his website in 2013. After catching the attention of indie rock duo Foxygen at a concert in Paris, Cameron toured extensively with Mac DeMarco, Kevin Morby, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Angel Olsen. In 2016, Secretly Canadian reissued the album to a wider audience and growing cult fanbase.
While promoting the album, Cameron struck up a friendship with The Killers frontman Brandon Flowers and subsequently co-wrote songs on the band's fifth and sixth studio albums, Wonderful Wonderful (2017) and Imploding the Mirage (2020). In 2017, Cameron released his second studio album, Forced Witness, featuring contributions from Molloy, Flowers, Olsen and Jonathan Rado. His third studio album, Miami Memory, was released in September 2019. His fourth studio album, Oxy Music, is scheduled for release in March 2022.

=== 2013–2016: Jumping the Shark ===
Regarding his adopted persona of that of a failed musician, Cameron notes, "I write about the outlier, the table-for-one guy, the guy whose life is a constellation of microscopic tragedies. Failure has been underexplored in music. My characters come from a place where ambition, crippling self-doubt and tragedy intersect."After releasing his debut album, Jumping the Shark, for free on his website, and physically through Siberia Records, Cameron attracted the attention of indie rock duo Foxygen while performing at David Lynch's Parisian club, Silencio. While on tour with Kevin Morby, in April 2016, the label Secretly Canadian announced they had signed Cameron and would be re-releasing Jumping the Shark in August 2016. Upon the announcement, Cameron issued the following statement: "Its 2016 [sic], and its time for Alex Cameron. Entertainer. Showman. Shaman. Side by side with his business partner and saxophonist, Roy Molloy, the duo are a living and breathing story of success told through the internet; unedited, unscripted, and, up until now, to a dedicated audience of no one. Thanks to the good people at Secretly Canadian that is about to change."
