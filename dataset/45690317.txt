Formed in Denver, Colorado in 2009, itchy-O released the EP Inferno! in 2011 and signed with iconic label Alternative Tentacles to release their full-length LP Burn the Navigator in September 2014. Both works were engineered by Bob Ferbrache (Slim Cessna's Auto Club, 16 Horsepower, DeVotchKa).
The group's second full-length album, From the Overflowing, was released on Alternative Tentacles in September 2017, followed by a cross-country supporting tour and live in-studio performance on WGN-TV on October 5, 2017.

During the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, the group developed two immersive drive-in concert series taking place in Denver: August's Sypherlot: Drive-in Radio Bath and October's Hallowmass. The recordings from these performances (engineered by Evergroove Studio) were released as SYPHERLOT/HALLOWMASS 2020: DOUBLE LIVE October 30, 2021 on Alternative Tentacles.On September 17, 2021, itchy-O played a surprise set for the grand opening of immersive art exhibition Meow Wolf's Denver location, Convergence Station.
