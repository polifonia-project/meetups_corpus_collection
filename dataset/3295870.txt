After his family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, he was a guitarist in a Christian rock  band.He says he grew up around Lakota and Navajo families in Iowa and Utah, the former of which he says gave him his name when he was 14 or 16. However, his claims of adoption into any Native American culture, his use of a Native American-sounding name, and concerns around the Indian Arts and Crafts Act have led to writers and reviewers emphasizing that he is not Native American.Spotted Eagle lives in Utah. He lost his son Joshua Davis Wallentine to suicide.His hobbies include wingsuiting. In 2015 he was appointed the U.S. Team Manager for the First World Cup of Wingsuit Performance Flying.
