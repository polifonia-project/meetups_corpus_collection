Ofstad was born in Trondheim. He got his first drum kit when he was eight years old, and slightly older joined a brass band. He describes his teens as hybridic, as he felt equally at home in jazz clubs as in discothèques. He is a graduate of Heimdal videregående skole where he got his Examen artium in 1988, and studied music at Berklee College of Music in Boston, whence he moved to Oslo, the capital of Norway, in 1991. Here he formed D'Sound (1993) together with Jonny Sjo, a fellow student from Boston, he played with Sofian Benzaim.
Ofstad contributed for some time in Knut Værnes Trio, and has also recorded an album with Ab und Zu (1996) winning the Smuget award the year after (1997). Together with Audun Kleive he constituted a plain drum duet in 2008.
