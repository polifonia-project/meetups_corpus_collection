Meatballs & Spaghetti is an American animated television series that aired on CBS on Saturday morning from September 18, 1982 to September 10, 1983. The show was produced by Intermedia Entertainment Company and Marvel Productions and aired on Starcade, CBS's Saturday morning cartoon programming block. It was one of the last Saturday morning cartoon series to be fitted with a laugh track.
The show was not well received, with a Variety review saying, "No try at music here, or even much comedy either. It's without any socially redeeming value."


== Summary ==
The series centered on Meatballs & Spaghetti, a husband-and-wife singing duo who roamed the country in a mobile home with their friend Clyde (who was their bassist), and their dog Woofer (who was their drummer). The main characters — fat Meatballs and skinny Spaghetti — were intended to be a mix of popular musicians Meat Loaf and Sonny & Cher. There was at least one original song in each episode.
