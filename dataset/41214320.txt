Kim was born in South Korea. For high school, she decided to go overseas, and attended Leonia High School in New Jersey. While attending high school in 2011, she heard about the New York City auditions for the South Korean singing competition Superstar K3. She asked a fellow Korean student Do Dae-yoon, who was known as a great guitarist at the school, to audition together, even though she did not know him well. He agreed, and they formed the band Togeworl. Togeworl managed to pass the audition, and flew to Seoul to compete. The duo were successful, and were picked to be mentored by singer-songwriter Yoon Jong-shin. Eventually they finished third in the competition, after Ulala Session and Busker Busker.After the competition, Kim and Do remained in South Korea, where they continued to receive musical training, and signed a contract with Mystic89.
