=== Living Out Loud ===
As Lines' career was taking off in Canada, he set his sights on an American record deal. He performed a showcase for RCA Nashville in May 2001. The next day, the label phoned to offer Lines a record deal. He immediately began work on his debut album, Living Out Loud, released on January 7, 2003. The album debuted at No. 9 on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart, while the first single, "You Can't Hide Beautiful," reached No. 4 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. The album was a success in Canada as well, and at the 2003 CCMA Awards, Lines received six nominations, including the Kraft Cheez Whiz Fans' Choice Award. When the awards were handed out in September, Lines was named Male Artist of the Year, and also picked up the Rising Star Award.
In 2003, Lines was an opening act for Martina McBride's Greatest Hits tour.

Aaron Lines' second album, Waitin' on the Wonderful, was released on September 6, 2005. The title track stalled at No. 36 on US Country and the album was not released in the US.

For two years, Lines had the most played song on Canadian country radio â€“ "Waitin' on the Wonderful" in 2005, and "Lights of My Hometown" in 2006.
