== Career ==
Jemini released a 7 track promo-only EP only Mercury/Polygram in 1995 called Scars and Pain."Funk Soul Sensation", produced by Organized Konfusion, was the debut single. In a review, Billboard called it "[s]ensational, smart soul." It peaked at number 36 on Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart. A remix of "Funk Soul Sensation" was released later in 1995 on 12" vinyl. The B-side was "Funk Soul Sensation pt.II", which continued the dual personas of "The Gifted One" and the "Funk Soul Sensation" rapping back and forth to each other. In 1997, Jemini released another promotional single titled "Who Wanna Step To Dis" which was followed by 1998's "I.M.C.U.D.O.N.T./Who Wanna Step II Dis."His 2003 collaboration with Danger Mouse, Ghetto Pop Life, landed the duo on The Guardian's list of The Forty Best Bands in the US, stating that the album "opts for a charming musical eclecticism and a fierce lyrical intelligence that bears comparison to prime-time Public Enemy." The Independent wrote, "Along with Outkast's double-header, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, Ghetto Pop Life is this year's most engrossing hip-hop record."In 2006, another rapper by the name of Gemini, under Lupe Fiasco's 1st & 15th label, emerged in the rap game. Jemini threatened to sue him so Gemini was forced to change his name to GemStones.In July 2014 a report from BoomBapBox.com revealed Jemini has changed his name to 'Big City' and is currently shopping a documentary about Ghetto Pop Life entitled 'Mice & Men' as well as working on new music and other projects.
