== Artistry ==
Zolita's music has been described as "a blend of dark-pop and R&B". Her musical style incorporates witchcraft and religion. She says that religious and witchcraft magic aesthetics are a huge part of her life saying "I feel like queer people are so drawn to Wicca and witchcraft because it's always been the alternative religion, it puts the power in yourself, and it's not historically been a religion that doesn't like queer people." She also cites Lady Gaga as her biggest influence.


== Personal life ==
Zolita identifies as lesbian. In a 2017 interview she expressed how lucky she was for growing in a liberal family surrounded by open-minded friends. In her school days, she was afraid to come out to her female friends, saying "I was also worried that my female friends would no longer want to have girls' nights or sleepovers for fear that I might be attracted to them. So, I decided to keep my newfound queerness a secret." She also identifies herself as a Witch, she explains this in videos on her YouTube channel, but also in her music videos where witchcraft is incorporated.
