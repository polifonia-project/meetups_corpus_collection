Jonathan Phillip "Sugarfoot" Moffett (born November 17, 1954) is an American drummer, songwriter and producer from New Orleans, Louisiana. Beginning in 1979, Moffett collaborated with the Jackson family, particularly Michael Jackson, over the course of 30 years. More recently, he has worked with other notable artists and producers such as Madonna, George Michael, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Quincy Jones and many others. He was bestowed the moniker of "Sugarfoot" by Michael Jackson due to becoming well-known for his frequent use of advanced techniques on the foot pedals.


== Early life ==
Moffett is the third son of a musical family of siblings. His two other brothers played the guitar and the bass guitar, while Jonathan's father encouraged him to drum. His influences are Zigaboo, Buddy Rich, Louis Bellson, Billy Cobham, James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Roger Taylor and other drummers, mostly originating from New Orleans.He initially wanted to play the bass guitar long before drums. He was always acutely aware of the bass guitar parts in songs and mimicked them on the bass drum. Moffett was never musically trained and learned to play drums on his own by ear. He was nicknamed "Sugarfoot" for his quick, articulate, and pronounced bass drum work, which requires a lot of precision and stamina for a drummer. He plays 16th note, 32nd note, and 64th note figures energetically and fluidly within rhythms. Moffett started off his drumming career by performing locally with prominent bands within the region and at nightclubs as a young boy.
He came up with his kung-fu inspired signature moves during a marathon practice session late one evening - the "one-handed cymbal catch" and his "backlash-whiplash" cymbal crashes (single and/or double hand) where he places two cymbals behind him and crashes/chokes them without looking.


== Career ==


=== The Jacksons ===


==== Initial audition ====
Moffett's professional career initially started with The Jacksons. In 1979, through serendipity, he came across The Jackson's musical director, James McField, who told him they were auditioning for a new drummer. Though the final auditions were that day, he extended it for him, knowing how eager he was to play for the group. According to an article by Robyn Flans in Drummer Magazine in September 1984, Moffett said:He [McField] called that night and the audition was set for the next day. I was familiar with their songs [The Jacksons] because I had grown up with their music, yet I didn't know everything about the music...After we finished a few songs, they pulled me aside and said they'd let me know something soon. That evening, I got the call and they said they wanted me to join the group. It was just a miracle. 


==== Touring with The Jacksons ====
His first major tour was the Destiny Tour (22.1.1979 – 13.1.1980) with The Jacksons. After his first show with the group, Michael Jackson was in awe by Moffett's ability to keep up with his dancing, always accenting his dance moves, which gave his dancing more power and prominence. He also used his "one-handed cymbal catch" frequently, in which Moffett explained to Zildjian:With the Jacksons, I'll use it to accent certain moments before the vocal chorus. OR when Michael makes a move and stops real quick, I'll accent that with a catch. You've got to do it fast and drop back into the rhythm without breaking time.He proceeded to perform on the Triumph Tour (8.7.1981 – 26.9.1981) with The Jacksons in 1981, which Rolling Stone later named as one of the best 25 tours of 1967 to 1987. Epic decided to have one of the shows from the tour recorded due to its immense popularity and success. Moffett also drummed around the United States and Canada for the record-breaking and famous Victory Tour (6.7.1984 – 9.12.1984), where he met Madonna backstage who asked him to drum for her upcoming The Virgin Tour (10.10.1985 – 11.6.1985). The Jacksons' Victory Tour promoted Michael Jackson's albums Off the Wall (1979) and Thriller (1982) and was promoted by Don King. Moffett performed with Eddie Van Halen, who made a few special appearances on some of the shows playing "Beat It" on guitar. Prince complimented Moffett after many shows with The Jacksons (and did the same seeing him live with other artists). He'd nod his head, smile, and say, "That was bad, you're bad".[5]

When Moffett turned professional, he designed innovative futuristic drum kits for every tour to complement the stage design. His work with The Jacksons and unique drumming style led him to become one of the most in-demand pop music drummers and perform on 23 world tours.


==== Pepsi commercial ====
Moffett was with Michael and the Jackson brothers during the infamous Pepsi commercial shoot in 1984 when Michael suffered from second-degree burns from the blazing pyrotechnics. He noticed the flames on Michael's hair at one point during the shoot and dropped his drum sticks and ran to help him just as some crew members did the same.


==== In the studio and The Jacksons Live! album ====
He is credited for live drumming on The Jacksons Live! (1981) album, which is RIAA-certified Gold. The double-disc album contains recordings of songs performed throughout the Triumph Tour (8.7.1981 – 26.9.1981). He also later recorded on The Jacksons' albums Victory (1984) and 2300 Jackson Street (1989).


=== Madonna ===


==== First three Madonna tours ====
After their initial meet during The Jacksons Victory Tour (6.7.1984 – 9.12.1984), Moffett finally agreed to tour with Madonna on her debut tour, The Virgin Tour (10.4.1985 – 11.6.1985) alongside Victory Tour bandmate, Patrick Leonard (musical director/keyboardist). The tour took place only in the United States and Canada. He was featured on Madonna's 1985 "Dress You Up" music video which was basically concert footage of her singing the song from The Virgin Tour. With the success of the tour, which was also released as a video album, Madonna requested Moffett to tour with her on her second tour, Who's That Girl Tour (14.6.1987 – 6.9.1987). The tour took place on a global level and was a huge commercial success, superseding the previous tour, and he finally toured with her on her controversial yet groundbreaking Blond Ambition Tour (13.4.1990 – 5.8.1990), which received accolades for its intricate choreography and stage production. The tour was followed by a 1991 motion picture film, Madonna: Truth or Dare, in which Moffett was featured in.


==== In the studio ====
Moffett also recorded on three Madonna albums with producer Patrick Leonard: True Blue (1986), Like a Prayer (1989), and I'm Breathless (1990). He recorded drums, percussion, and background vocals on all three albums.

The album was also Elton's first platinum album since 1983 with many hit singles. Moffett was also credited on To Be Continued a four-disc box set, recorded on various locations between 1965–1991, that chronicled Elton's songs from his days with Bluesology to the present day; it included newly recorded songs. He was also credited for live drumming on Elton's Duets (1993) album for the song "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" which was recorded live with George Michael at Wembley Arena in 1991. He is also credited on Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin (1991) and was additionally featured in the 1991 TV movie Two Rooms: A Tribute to Elton John & Bernie Taupin.

There are snippets of him drumming throughout the documentary as well as discussing the concert series that never came to be and his history with Jackson.


==== Friendship with Michael Jackson ====
Though Moffett was known as "Sugarfoot" to the rest of the world, Michael cut his stage name short and called him "Foot" instead. Moffett was Michael Jackson's live drummer of choice from the beginning when he first started drumming with The Jacksons. Michael always called him first for each tour and show, even when he was under contract with other artists. The two collaborated over the course of 30 years starting in 1979 to 2009 with a total of four tours together; This Is It (13.7.2009 – 6.3.2010) would have been the fifth. Aside from working with Michael, he was friends with him and hung out at The Jackson Estate (Hayvenhurst home) with the family (including with Jackson family matriarch, Katherine Jackson, who he considers his "second mother") and one-on-one with Michael at Neverland Ranch and his other homes. The two had drawing contests on the road when touring and Jackson sent him birthday and holiday cards when they were not together. Moffett was with him the night before he died until 1 AM.
