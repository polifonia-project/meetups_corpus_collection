Stuart Leslie Braithwaite (born 10 May 1976) is a Scottish multi-instrumentalist, singer and songwriter. He is the guitarist of post rock band Mogwai, with whom he has recorded ten studio albums. He is also a member of the British alternative rock supergroup Minor Victories.


== Early life (1976–1994) ==
Braithwaite grew up listening to records by The Cure, Joy Division, The Stooges, The Velvet Underground, Black Sabbath and other artists. He attended Strathaven Academy from 1987 to 1993. Before playing in Mogwai, Braithwaite fronted a band called Deadcat Motorbike, who broke up in June 1995. Braithwaite also drummed for Scottish band Eska at one point.


== Formation and first years of Mogwai (1995–1996) ==

Braithwaite met Dominic Aitchison at a Ned's Atomic Dustbin show at the Queen Margaret Union in Glasgow on 10 April 1991, and four years later, along with school friend Martin Bulloch, they formed Mogwai.


== Solo work and Rock Action (2000–2002) ==
In 2000, Braithwaite played with a band called Mighty Joe Young Trio. In 2000 and 2002, Braithwaite performed solo acoustic shows. In 2002, Braithwaite, Aidan Moffat and Colin "Sheepy" McPherson released an eponymously titled EP called The Sick Anchors. He is also a member of the British alternative rock supergroup Minor Victories.


== Film ==
In 2016 Braithwaite took part in a documentary about Glasgow music, and Chemikal Underground Records, called Lost in France. The film was directed by Niall McCann and brought Braithwaite (along with members of The Delgados, Franz Ferdinand and others) to Mauron, Brittany, to recreate a gig they played just after Mogwai had formed. The film features Mogwai live, as well as footage of Braithwaite playing Mogwai tracks solo. It also shows Braithwaite playing live with Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand, and musicians such as Emma Pollock, RM Hubbert, and Holy Mountain, and interviews with Braithwaite and his old label-mates. Lost in France premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival to wholly positive reviews and was called "Funny, vital and sobering” by Scotland's arts publication, The Skinny.


== Musical style ==
Braithwaite's musical technique is characterised by the heavy usage of effects pedals, used to create ambient instrumental guitar sounds. As with much music associated with the post-rock style, his playing emphasizes melody and dynamic contrast over virtuosity.


== Personal life ==
Braithwaite's family originate from Flesherin on the Isle of Lewis; he was born and raised in Glasgow.Braithwaite married musician Elisabeth Elektra in April 2019. He was previously married to music promoter Grainne Braithwaite-Vedamanikam.
