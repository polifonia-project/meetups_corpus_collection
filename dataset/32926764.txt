=== Music ===
In 1987, he founded the pioneering Italian music label Minus Habens Records (involving artists such as Angelo Badalamenti, Brian Eno, Aphex Twin and Depeche Mode), through which he continues to explore and publish avant-garde and cutting-edge music. Several years later he established the Disturbance label to focus on ambient electronic and techno music.In the late 1980s, Iusco founded the dark ambient and industrial music group, Nightmare Lodge, whose music was primarily released through Minus Habens. During the 1990s, Iusco recorded works under the name "It" and released the first album under that name, Era Vulgaris, on his Disturbance imprint in 1996.

He debuted in the film industry in 1999, having composed the music for the Apulian cult movie LaCapaGira directed by Alessandro Piva, and went on to win Best Soundtrack at the 2000 Valencia Film Festival (Spain). In 2003 he composed the music for Mio Cognato, a movie by the same director, for which he received the 2004 Nastro d'Argento nomination for Best Soundtrack.
Iusco has partnered often with the well-known Italian director, Sergio Rubini, composing the main theme for the movie L’Anima Gemella (2002), the soundtrack of L’Amore Ritorna (2004), and an additional score for Colpo D’Occhio (2008) which complemented the music of Pino Donaggio.
