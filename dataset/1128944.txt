Torres met Alec John Such while playing with a band called Phantom's Opera and it was this friendship which led to him joining Bon Jovi. When Jon Bon Jovi, the lead singer of the band, approached Torres, he was put off by the fact that Jon was 9 years younger than himself. He said it was Jon's charismatic appearance and watching him perform that attracted him to join the band.
Torres is primarily a drummer and percussionist, but he sang lead vocals on a song on the box set 100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong, as well as backing vocals on a couple of the early Bon Jovi tracks, notably "Born to Be My Baby" and "Love for Sale".

Torres is a self-taught painter, who paints expressive pictures which show scenes from everyday life and his life with the band.
His painting talent was shown in one of the three videos made for the single "Who Says You Can't Go Home."
Torres also owns a fashion line for babies called Rock Star Baby.
