Elizabeth McGrath (born in Los Angeles, California) is an American artist and singer. She is based in California who works primarily in the fields of sculpture and animation. Her work is often evocative of the darker side of life, and she has been nicknamed Bloodbath McGrath after the subject matter of her works. Along with her career in art, from 1989–1999 she was the lead singer for the hardcore band Tongue, and co-founded the fanzine Censor this. From 2000–2011 she was the lead singer of the Los Angeles-born band Miss Derringer along with her husband/songwriter Morgan Slade.


== History ==
McGrath was born in Los Angeles and raised in Echo Park and Altadena, California.  Her mom is an immigrant from Singapore. At the age of 13 she was sent to a Fundamentalist Baptist correctional institution called the Victory Christian Academy, and credits that for much of the inspiration for her artwork. She later attended Pasadena City College.
McGrath began her career in art by making flyers for her punk band Tongue and creating a fanzine called Censor This, a collective effort with several other artists.  Her first showing was at La Luz de Jesus Gallery in Hollywood. She currently shows at their new gallery, Billy Shire Fine Arts in Culver City, California.
McGrath contributed quotes to Girls Against Girls by author Bonnie Burton.On November 2, 2013, McGrath was part of a four-woman show in Los Angeles called "Black Moon" with fellow female artists, Jessicka Addams, Camille Rose Garcia and Marion Peck.
