== Biography ==
Kid Sister was born Melisa Young on July 3, 1980 in Markham, Illinois. She started to rap in October 2006, becoming an MC at monthly dance parties hosted by DJ duo Flosstradamus (Josh Young, of Flosstradamus, is Melisa's brother), who were featured in MTV's My Block that same year. She made URB's "The Next 1000" cover in April 2007, and was signed to DJ A-Trak's label, Fool's Gold, who released her first single "Pro Nails", which features Kanye West. Kid Sister later signed with Downtown Records, who re-released "Pro Nails" to critical acclaim.
Kid Sister also appears on Tittsworth's "WTF", from his debut album 12 Steps, with Pase Rock. She had also finished a mixtape with A-Trak.
In Fall 2009, Kid Sister finished recording her debut studio album. The title was changed from Dream Date to Ultraviolet. The album was produced by the likes of Rusko, The Count & Sinden, XXXChange, and Brian Kennedy, and includes a collaboration with English singer Estelle titled "First Ladies", which is a remake of Queen Latifah's 1989 acclaimed track "Ladies First" from her debut album All Hail the Queen.Her single "Control" is featured in the 2009 music video game DJ Hero, combined with Rihanna's "Disturbia". The album's lead single was "Right Hand Hi", produced by Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso of house DJ group Swedish House Mafia."I think a lot of people are going to be surprised with the fact that there's a bunch of raw hip-hop records on there," said A-Trak. "It's not all up tempo clubby stuff. I think a lot of people are going to be impressed with her growth also because when she made a lot of the records that people have heard by now, she was just starting to rap."In late 2010, Kid Sister released a mix tape titled Kiss Kiss Kiss and in 2014 she released a second mix tape, "Dusk2Dawn: The Diary of Jane Jupiter" in which she tackled more serious, personal subjects. In 2016 she began working on her second album with UK producer Inflo.
