He was born in Providence, Rhode Island, United States. Hamilton began to play the tenor saxophone at the age of sixteen.

He has worked with Ruby Braff and Warren Vache.He recorded his first significant jazz album as a leader for Chiaroscuro in 1977. The same year, he proceeded to record his first album for Concord, with whom he maintained a long recording career as a solo act, and as a member of the Concord Jazz All Stars. He accompanied singer Rosemary Clooney in the studio and on the road for a decade.
During the 1980s, he toured Japan, Sweden, the UK, and performed at the Grande Parade du Jazz in Nice, France. In the 1990s, he moved to London and formed a quartet with John Pearce, Dave Green, and Steve Brown. In 2007, he made a guest appearance at the Brecon Jazz Festival, accompanied by Humphrey Lyttelton and his band. Part of this concert was shown on BBC Four as Humph's Last Stand, a tribute to Lyttelton following his death in 2008. In 2013 and 2014, Hamilton worked with Andrea Motis and Joan Chamorro.
