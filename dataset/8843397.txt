== History ==
Terry Brown is referred to fondly by the band Rush as "Broon" in the liner notes for their albums. This nickname appears in the title of the instrumental piece "Broon's Bane" from their live album Exit...Stage Left. On this same record, Geddy Lee jokingly introduces the song "Jacob's Ladder" as having been written by "T. C. Broonsie", another reference to Brown and a pun on the name of Big Bill Broonzy. He also appears as the uncredited voice of the hypnotist on the Dream Theater album Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory.
Brown has also engineered, produced or mixed for many other artists, including Sonny and Cher, Kenny Rogers, Traffic, Joe Cocker, The Who, Procol Harum, The Troggs, Manfred Mann, Marianne Faithfull, Spencer Davis Group, Donovan, Barbra Streisand, Blue Rodeo, Moist, Max Webster, Klaatu, Thundermug, Fates Warning, Lizzy Borden, Voivod, Ray Stevens, the Bonzo Dog Band, Motherlode, Dr. Music, April Wine, The Stampeders, Michel Pagliaro, Moe Koffman, Alannah Myles, B.B.
