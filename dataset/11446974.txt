Molly Neuman (born June 18, 1972) is an American drummer, writer and publisher, originally from the Washington, D.C. area who has performed in such influential bands as Bratmobile, the Frumpies, and the PeeChees. She was a pioneer of the early-to-mid '90s riot grrrl movement, penning the zine which coined the phrase in its title. She also co-wrote Girl Germs with Bratmobile singer Allison Wolfe while the two were students at the University of Oregon; that title later became the name of a Bratmobile song.

She also founded Indivision Management, and has worked as a manager for such artists as the Locust, Ted Leo and the Donnas.Neuman currently resides in Brooklyn and is Head of Music for Kickstarter. She was previously Director of Label Relations for eMusic, and in 2006 started a band with former PeeChees member Carlos Cañedo called Love or Perish but is no longer in the band.
During high school, Neuman worked for Arizona Representative Mo Udall.
