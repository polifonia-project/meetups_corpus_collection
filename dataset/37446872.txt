== Early years ==
Holley was born in London, England. His father, Jeffrey Holley, led a swing music band and his mother, Irene Holley, was the singer. He first studied the piano, however from the age of 8 he'd always been interested in drums so he took up the drums at the age of 12.

In the course of his career, dating all the way back to 1970 and an album with the band Horse, and including numerous appearances as a session musician, he performed and recorded with Paul McCartney, Elton John, Kiki Dee, G.T. Moore & The Reggae Guitars, Joe Cocker, Ian Hunter, Tommy Shaw, Julian Lennon, Dar Williams, Richard Barone, Ben E. King, and Chuck Berry.  In 1978, soon after performing on Elton John's hit single "Ego", a chance meeting in a pub in his hometown of Staines with Denny Laine resulted in him being invited to join Wings.
