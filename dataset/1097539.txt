Rowntree has been a keen activist and supporter of the Labour Party since becoming a member in 2002, and has been chairman of London's West End branch. In April 2007 he unsuccessfully contested the safe Conservative seat of Marylebone High Street on Westminster City Council. In July 2008, he fought the Labour-held seat of Church Street, a Labour stronghold since its creation in the 1960s, but a swing from Labour to the Conservatives of 14.1% meant that he was again unsuccessful, as the Conservatives gained the seat.
In February 2008, he was selected by the Cities of London and Westminster Constituency Labour Party to stand against Conservative MP Mark Field at the 2010 General Election. He was defeated at that election. In 2011, Rowntree sought selection as Labour candidate for Norwich South; he lost to Clive Lewis, a journalist and former soldier, who went on to be elected as MP.
Rowntree supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq and in 2007 said, "I'm not a pacifist, I do believe that some things are worth fighting for, and dying for. I understand that that's easier to say, I'm not being the one who's asked to die, but Saddam was such an illegal ruthless bastard I didn't shed any tears for it [the war]."Rowntree is a committed opponent of the death penalty and patron of Amicus, an organisation that provides legal representation to those on death row in the United States.
In August 2014, Rowntree was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue.In the Norfolk County Council election on 4 May 2017, he was elected as county councillor for the University division in Norwich.

== Personal life ==
In 1994, Rowntree married Paola, a Canadian woman. The couple divorced in the early 2000s. In 2007, he was dating Michelle de Vries.In the early 1990s, Rowntree was a heavy drinker; he stopped drinking alcohol in 1993 after a particularly heavy drinking session with members of the band Siouxsie and the Banshees. However, several years later, he began a cocaine habit. This led to a public incident in 2003 when, during a TV interview of Blur for MuchMusic by Canadian journalist Nardwuar the Human Serviette, Rowntree was seen mocking and physically intimidating Nardwuar throughout the interview. Rowntree has apologised several times since for his behaviour, saying that "the day after a cocaine binge I'd sometimes fly into a murderous rage," and that this was the case on that day. By 2007, he stated that he had stopped using drugs and was "active in the recovery community". He keeps a clip of the interview on his phone, to watch if he ever considers relapsing into drug use.
