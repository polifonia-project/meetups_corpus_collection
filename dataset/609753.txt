Åkerfeldt is known for his progressive rock-influenced songwriting style and his frequent use of both clean baritone and growled vocals.

== Career ==

A native of Stockholm, Mikael Åkerfeldt was the vocalist for Eruption, a death metal band that he formed in 1987 at 13 years old. After Eruption came to an end in 1989, he formed
Opeth, ostensibly as a keyboardist. When vocalist David Isberg insisted Åkerfeldt formed the band, all formed members. Persson left Opeth two years later, Åkerfeldt replaced him as the bassist. Isberg assumed guitar duties, and when he left Opeth three years later, Åkerfeldt replaced him as the vocalist.
Åkerfeldt performed the death vocals on Katatonia's album Brave Murder Day and their EP Sounds of Decay.
Åkerfeldt revealed in September 2009 that he is contemplating recording a singer-songwriter acoustic solo album.
However, in 2014 he expressed the view that he didn't have the need for a special solo project and that he can put pretty much anything into Opeth.In an interview on STIM magazine, he revealed that one of the highlights of his career was Opeth's performance at the Royal Albert Hall.


=== Influences ===
Åkerfeldt is a collector of obscure 1970s rock and heavy metal albums. He also tends to show his influence from these obscure bands, making reference to them in Opeth album titles such as Blackwater Park, Still Life and My Arms, Your Hearse, as well as songs such as "Master's Apprentices" and "Goblin". He is also influenced extensively by jazz, the musician Ritchie Blackmore, Magma and its founder Christian Vander, and Hideki Ishima.When asked what the album was that 'made him a metalhead', Åkerfeldt answered that it was probably The Number of the Beast by Iron Maiden, but also mentioned Lick It Up by Kiss. In a different interview he stated that he usually cites Black Sabbath's Sabbath Bloody Sabbath as the best (and favourite) heavy metal album of all time. He also has considered Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny as his favourite metal album.


== Personal life ==
On 15 August 2003, Mikael Åkerfeldt married his longtime girlfriend, Anna. In 2004 Anna gave birth to their first daughter, Melinda. The couple had their second daughter, Mirjam, in 2007. In 2016, in an interview with The Quietus, Åkerfeldt revealed he had gone through a divorce.Åkerfeldt is known to be friends with Steven Wilson, the frontman of one of his favorite bands, Porcupine Tree, who also produced the Opeth albums Blackwater Park, Deliverance and Damnation; Mike Portnoy, former drummer of Dream Theater (who is featured in their music video for Wither); and Jonas Renkse of Katatonia. He is also presumed to be the basis for the character Toki Wartooth from the popular cartoon Metalocalypse, as divulged in an interview with Ultimate Guitar. Åkerfeldt doesn't practice any religion and considers himself an atheist.
