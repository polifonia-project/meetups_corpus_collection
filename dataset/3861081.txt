Carl Johan Grimmark (born  October 14, 1977
) is a Swedish guitarist. He has appeared with several influential Christian metal bands including Narnia, Saviour Machine, and Rob Rock. He recently joined the band Beautiful Sin in 2006, he has also played with Jerusalem on some occasions including Sweden rock in 2015.  He also has been a special guest guitarist on fellow Narnia bandmate Christian Liljegren's side projects Divinefire and Audiovision.  He recently recorded his debut solo album that is set to be titled Grimmark, where he also handles the lead vocals. Grimmark's style of playing, especially on Narnia's earlier work, is often compared to the neo-classical metal stylings of Yngwie Malmsteen[1], or under a more broad genre, neo-classicism.
Grimmark is the main composer in Narnia, and on their album The Great Fall most of the lyrics were written by him. On their other albums the lyrics have been written by their vocalist Christian Liljegren. Grimmark is also given credits as a producer on several of Narnia's albums.
Grimmark has become a highly acclaimed guitarist in the Christian hard rock music genre as more people are exposed to his solid technical abilities, which can be exemplified by the fact that he is credited for playing every instrument on Narnia's first album, Awakening, and his unique approach towards incorporating a neo-classical sound into his music.
