Q5 is an American hard rock/heavy metal band from Seattle, Washington, United States, who formed in 1983. Their first studio album, titled Steel the Light, came out in 1984. Picking up some critical praise, the outfit toured with the likes of Lita Ford and Twisted Sister. However, the group faced internal divisions that ultimately ended the project before the 1980s came to a close. In 2014, Q5 re-formed to perform at the Sweden Rock Festival, and the band members involved found that the one-off event was not enough, deciding to continue on with the revamped version of the group.


== Biography ==
Q5 started in 1983. It functioned as a kind of 'supergroup' of sorts by mixing together members of two popular Seattle bands of the time. Frontman Jonathan K and guitarist Floyd D. Rose from "C.O.R.E." (or "The C.O.R.E.") joined up with guitarist Rick Pierce, bassist Evan Sheeley, and drummer Gary Thompson from "TKO". Their first studio album, 1984's Steel the Light, earned praise from several critics. Q5 signed on with Polygram for their 1985 sophomore release, When The Mirror Cracks, but the writing was already on the wall. Personal differences ripped the group apart not long after said release.The band has featured a melodic hard rock sound incorporating heavy metal influences, with its songs being covered by the likes of Great White and Wolf. Ex-member Floyd Rose is also better known as the inventor of the guitar locking tremolo system.
