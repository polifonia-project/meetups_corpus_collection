Yoji Biomehanika, also known as YOJI, Mutant DJ, Ozaka Oz, Bionico, Biomehanika, Yōran and The Arcade Nation is a Japanese trance/hard trance DJ. A household name in the Japanese club scene in the 1990s, Yoji entered the international scene in 2001 when he was featured in the lineup for the Dance Valley music festival in the Netherlands in front of 90,000 people. He then started headlining some of the largest international music events such as Sensation Black, Tomorrowland and Street Parade. He is now considered one of the icons of hard dance music. 


== Style ==
Yoji's style of music has changed throughout his career, starting off in the 1980s as Yōran, and for a time a member of Japanese punk band Laughin' Nose. He began DJing trance music in the 1990s before moving into the tougher variants of hard trance and NRG by the start of the 2000s. He produced many hard trance anthems during this time, including his most well known tracks of "Hardstyle Disco" and "Samurai".
In 2007, Yoji dropped his 'Yoji Biomehanika' alias and changed to a new style of music with the release of "Techy Techy". Yoji calls the style Tech Dance and can be described as a mix between Hard Dance and Techno, mainly characterised by its speed, offbeat rhythms and energy. Further accentuated by Yoji's energetic performance style, Tech Dance has become a genre in its own right, with artists such as Joe-E, Vandall & Remo-con all producing this style of music. The latest releases on Yoji's Hellhouse label have been in this style of music.
Early on in 2012, Yoji announced via his Ameba blog that his Hellhouse label was being shut down to make way for a new label project entitled "dieTunes". The official site and the label itself was launched in June, with the first 3 official releases in July that same year.In early 2015, Yoji announced on his Ameba blog, website and other social media outlets that he was moving back to his previous alias of Yoji Biomehanika after feeling that he had drifted away from Tech Dance and back to more "big room" sounds. With a studio album in the works for release in June 2015  and an artist album celebrating 25 years of his work in music, Yoji also announced a new single to be released around the same time.
