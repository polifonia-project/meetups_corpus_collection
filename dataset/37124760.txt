== Personal life ==
Jahméne Douglas was born in Birmingham in 1991 to Mandy Thomas and Eustace Douglas. He is of mixed heritage which includes English, St. Kitts (Caribbean) and Welsh. He is the first youth ambassador of the UK charity Women's Aid, for children and young people. Before rising to fame when he appeared on The XFactor, he worked in an Asda supermarket in Swindon.
Jahméne is of Christian faith and speaks openly about how that has pulled him through many dark places. His debut album's title, Love Never Fails, is taken from the scripture 1 Corinthians 13, one of his favourite passages in the Bible. The idea of the album was to have spiritual twists on the chosen covers. Jahméne has been seen exercising his faith in public. He refused to sing "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" by Katy Perry, for an X Factor group ensemble performance, because of its graphic/unsuitable lyrical content. He opined that Ella Henderson, 16 at the time, should not be made to sing the song and that lyrically it was not suitable for the family show.
