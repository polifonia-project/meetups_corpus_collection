Two of his books, Stage Music of Maharashtra and Maharashtra: Art music shed light on the musical theatre and art music in Maharashtra, giving a wider perspective about region based cultural musicology. In Some Hindustani Musicians: They lit the way! (Promilla Publishers, New Delhi, 2011), Dr Ranade's observations and interpretations about various maestros in Hindustani Music give us an analytical perspective along with the aesthetic experience of the musician’s music.
He contributed a lot in developing the "Aesthetics of Indian Music" through his book Sangeetache Saundarya Shastra (संगीताचे सौंदर्यशास्त्र). He also introduced the aesthetics of Western music to Indian readers through his book, Stravinsky che Sangeetik Saundarya Shastra. 
"The theory of six categories of music" is considered to be the most important and well accepted theory proposed by Ranade which structures Musical categories as 1.Primitive, 2.Folk, 3.Art, 4.Devotional, 5.Popular and 6.Confluence. He was pioneer in theorizing the unexplored areas such as Folk Music in India in his book Lok Sangeet Shastra (लोकसंगीत शास्त्र), Hindi Film Song: Music Beyond Boundaries and Popular music in the book Sangeet Sangati (संगीत संगती).
