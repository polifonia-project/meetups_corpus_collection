In 2019, she took a leap to venture into movie production as she joined forces with Waje to collaborate on a film project as co-producers. The movie titled ‘She Is’ directed by Eneng Enaji is an extension or replica of her humanitarian works and the values she has upheld and consistently communicated in her work of art. ‘She Is’ takes a ride through the societal standards, expectations and restrictions a successful Nigerian woman is faced within Nigeria.
