Husband is a member of John McLaughlin's group The 4th Dimension and also performs with Germany's Norddeutscher Rundfunk Big Band and as a solo pianist. He has been a member of many of Billy Cobham's groups (including Cobham's Spectrum 40 band), the guitarist Allan Holdsworth's groups, British pop/funk band Level 42 and groups led by Jack Bruce and guitarist Gary Moore. As a session musician, Husband also performed, recorded or toured with Jeff Beck, Robin Trower, Nguyên Lê, Lenny White, Randy Brecker, Soft Machine Legacy, Foley, Al Jarreau, Hessischer Rundfunk Big Band, George Martin, Quincy Jones, Andy Summers, UK, Mike Stern, Dewa Budjana, Jack DeJohnette, Tony Levin, Lincoln Goines, Jimmy Haslip, and Antoine Fafard.


== Early years and career beginnings ==
Born in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, to dancer Patricia Husband and musician Peter Husband, Gary Husband trained as a classical pianist with Dame Fanny Waterman DBE and Bryan Layton. His distinct piano style has been noted to reveal jazz fusion and classical music influences. While being an internationally respected drummer, he is essentially self-taught, though he picked up casual lessons with various professional players at a young age and later spent a lengthier term with drum teacher Geoff Myers.
Having been a professional player on drums and piano from the age of 13 he joined The Syd Lawrence Orchestra at 16 as their full-time drummer. In addition to this he picked up session or touring work with artists or acts such as Lulu and The Bachelors among many others. Husband also frequently played in his home town with visiting jazz soloists from London in pubs and music venues.
Upon a move to London at the age of 18, Husband held either the piano or drums chair in groups such as Mike Carr Trio, Barbara Thompson's Paraphernalia, Gary Boyle Trio, the Morrissey–Mullen band, Jeff Clyne's Turning Point, occasionally recording with the BBC Big Band and frequently picking up freelance work performing at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club.


== Solo career ==
In 1998, Husband released his first (solo synth) album, Diary Of A Plastic Box (later to be re-released as a double CD in 2008, entitled The Complete Diary Of A Plastic Box), From 1998 to 2001 he led his piano trio (The New Gary Husband Trio) featuring bassist Mick Hutton and drummer Gene Calderazzo. The trio's CD releases From The Heart and Aspire (featuring guest appearances by Billy Cobham, vocalists Mark King (musician), Christine Tobin and Hamish Stuart), highlight the music of this group. Of his several solo piano album releases, The Things I See * Interpretations Of The Music Of Allan Holdsworth is an imaginative reworking of the guitarist's music. Years later he released A Meeting Of Spirits, presenting a further selection of similarly highly personalised works based on the music of John McLaughlin.
Gary Husband's Force Majeure, his group from 2004 to 2005, featured Mahavishnu Orchestra electric violinist Jerry Goodman, trumpeter Randy Brecker, trombonist Elliot Mason, keyboard player Jim Beard, bassist Matthew Garrison and percussionist Arto Tuncboyaciyan. In 2004 the group won funding from the Contemporary Music Network and BBC Radio 3's Jazz On 3 to tour the UK. The DVD release Gary Husband's Force Majeure - Live At The Queen Elizabeth Hall, London captured the band's London performance from their debut tour.
His next jazz quartet project, Gary Husband's Drive featured saxophonist Julian Siegel, trumpeter Richard Turner and bassist Michael Janisch. Husband released their debut album Hotwired in 2009 and the group disbanded in early 2010.
Among his more recent projects was Dirty & Beautiful, an album project in two volumes featuring performances from himself together with many of his friends and musical collaborators, past and present. Guitarists Allan Holdsworth, Neil Taylor (guitarist), Steve Topping, John McLaughlin, Wayne Krantz, Robin Trower, Ray Russell, Steve Hackett, Mike Stern, Alex Machacek and Jimmy Herring appear, along with bassists Jimmy Johnson (bassist), Mark King, Laurence Cottle and keyboardist Jan Hammer.
Husband produced a piano and electric guitar duet album with Alex Machacek in 2013 for Abstractlogix entitled NOW.
In July 2013, Gary Husband performed a solo piano concert at the Saint-Émilion Jazz Festival.
In May 2017, Husband took his first big band production ("Dreams In Blue") to the Norddeutscher Rundfunk Big Band. Consisting of mostly his own material Husband enlisted composer and arranger Dale Wilson to prepare and interpret the scores, while Tim Hagans was brought in to direct the band. The production featured Husband playing both piano and drums. Gary also integrated special guest (Hungarian violinist) Zoltán Lantos for the debut concert performance in Hamburg.
Husband brought about his current project The Trackers (with Gary Husband & Alf Terje Hana) which he leads in collaboration with Norwegian guitarist & composer Hana. Their album “Vaudeville 8:45” was recorded in 2021 (at that point still without a resident bassist) so Husband enlisted a roster of seven special guest bassists to perform on the recordings. Bassists Etienne MBappé, Guy Pratt, Jimmy Haslip, Jimmy Johnson, Øyvind Grong, Mark King (musician) and Kevin Scott all feature throughout the album.


== Educational ==
In 1997, Rittor Music Japan released the semi-educational video Gary Husband * Interplay & Improvisation On The Drums.
Husband is an internationally respected drum clinician and has performed over the years in this capacity alongside Ricky Lawson, Omar Hakim, Dennis Chambers, Vinnie Colaiuta, Denny Seiwell, Todd Sucherman, Paul Wertico, Terry Bozzio, Simon Phillips and Billy Cobham among many others.
He has held a masterclass at the Drummers Collective in N.Y.C., and is a patron and visiting artist at Tech Music School in London.
Husband runs his own motivational and educational drum method course The Gary Husband Drum Videocasts Series from his own website.


== Affiliations with others ==


=== Allan Holdsworth ===
A chance meeting with the influential guitarist Allan Holdsworth and bassist Jack Bruce in 1979, (while Husband was fulfilling his last engagement with saxophonist Barbara Thompson at Ronnie Scott's Club) resulted in a casual jam session. Soon after, Holdsworth, along with Husband, formed Holdsworth & Co (later to be renamed False Alarm, and eventually Allan Holdsworth I.O.U.), and eventually found their bass player in Paul Carmichael, also adding vocalist Paul Williams. The group's hugely influential I.O.U. album was recorded soon after, although not released until 1982, upon the band's moderately successful launch in America.
In the decades since then, Husband has internationally toured and recorded with Holdsworth prolifically, through many different group personnel lineups. The association, featuring Jimmy Johnson (bassist), continued until Holdsworth's passing in April 2017 and is regarded by Husband as the most significant of his career.
As well as drums, Husband contributed keyboard parts for some tracks on two Holdsworth albums: Secrets and Wardenclyffe Tower. For the former, Husband composed the composition "City Nights" on which he plays keyboards and the drummer is Vinnie Colaiuta.


=== John McLaughlin ===
Gary Husband was recruited by John McLaughlin in April 2005 to play keyboards in a formation called John McLaughlin & Friends for a concert in Réunion Island. Soon after, he performed keyboards and drums on McLaughlin's Industrial Zen album.
The regularly touring and recording band John McLaughlin & The 4th Dimension was then formed with Husband featured on both his instruments, bassist Hadrien Feraud and drummer Mark Mondesir. Following the departure of Feraud, (and after a short spell with bassist Dominique Di Piazza in his place) Étienne M'Bappé joined the group and McLaughlin recorded the highly acclaimed, Grammy-nominated 2010 album To the One with the new lineup, on which Husband was also featured as principal drummer (on two tracks) as well as the keyboardist throughout.
Drummer Ranjit Barot later replaced Mark Mondesir in the drum chair (leaving Husband as the only remaining originally recruited member), and the new 2011 version of the group recorded the album Now Here This, which was released in Autumn 2012.
In 2007, Husband performed with the John McLaughlin Band (along with Matthew Garrison on bass and Vinnie Colaiuta on drums) at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival in Chicago.
Husband's composition "Sulley" has long been a popular inclusion to the 4th Dimension's live repertoire, and features on the group's 2009 live DVD in Belgrade.
On 7 October 2013, Husband and John McLaughlin performed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as a duet. Following the performance, the Paul Reed Smith guitar McLaughlin played was presented to the museum by its maker.


=== Billy Cobham ===
In 1992, Gary Husband joined legendary drummer Billy Cobham's regular touring band playing keyboards and second drum kit. Soon after, he recorded on Cobham's The Traveler album, and to date Husband is still the only additional drummer to have performed a drums duet with the former Mahavishnu Orchestra drummer on one of his own recordings. In 1995 the Billy Cobham International Quartet (featuring Husband, bassist Kai Eckhardt and guitarist Peter Wolpl) toured North America and Canada.
Other notable touring or recording periods with Cobham include the 1998 Billy Cobham (featuring Randy Brecker) Quintet, (with which Husband recorded the album Focused) and the 2002 U.S.A. "Spectrum" 30th Anniversary Tour, along with bassist Leland Sklar and guitarist Dean Brown (guitarist).
Husband also toured with Cobham's Higher Ground, North By Northwest and Culture Mix bands, recording the album Culture Mix with the latter. Husband's compositions "Le Coco", "Blue Dreams" and "Avatar" were performed by Cobham's groups during these periods.
In early 2013, Husband was recruited again as keyboardist and contributing composer for Cobham's 40th "Spectrum" Anniversary U.S. tour, along with guitarist Dean Brown, violinist Jerry Goodman and bassist Ric Fierabracci. In September and October of the same year, the group (now known as Billy Cobham Spectrum 40) returned to the U.S.A., Canada and Europe (minus Jerry Goodman) and performed further touring. Husband's pieces "If The Animals Had Guns Too" and "Dreams In Blue" were featured compositions on these tours.
The album Billy Cobham's Spectrum 40 Live was released in 2015 and consisted of recorded material from the band's 2013 international touring activity. Husband left the group in May 2015.


=== Jack Bruce ===
In April 1992, Husband performed a benefit concert in London with Jack Bruce alongside guitarist Clem Clempson and keyboardist Ronnie Leahy, marking the beginning of a new working relationship with the ex-Cream bassist and singer. In 1993 Husband toured North America and Europe with Bruce along with guitarist Blues Saraceno and performed at the ‘Jack Bruce 50th Birthday Concerts’ in Cologne (playing drums and piano) along with Clem Clempson, Ginger Baker, Gary 'Mudbone' Cooper, Gary Moore, Pete Brown, Dick Heckstall-Smith, Bernie Worrell, Simon Phillips, Kip Hanrahan and others. The events were both filmed and released on audio CD by CMP Records.
Husband and Bruce recorded two tracks on Gary Moore's Ballads & Blues 1982–1994 album in 1994, and the three had been working as a regularly performing power trio. This line-up was the original blueprint for the group which was to become BBM (Bruce-Baker-Moore) which Husband missed due to touring commitments with Billy Cobham. Ginger Baker was recruited in his place, and since, Husband has also worked regularly in a trio format with Bruce alongside guitarist Clem Clempson.


=== Jack Bruce / Robin Trower / Gary Husband ===
In 2007, Jack Bruce again joined forces with the guitarist Robin Trower for a third recording together. Husband was enlisted for the new studio album, named Seven Moons. A new three-piece was established as a result of the group's successful chemistry and the trio toured extensively through Europe together, later releasing on both CD and DVD as Seven Moons Live. This was later released as a joint CD/DVD package, retitled as, Song From The Road.


=== Level 42 ===
Following the departure of original band members Phil Gould and Boon Gould in 1987, Husband was invited to join (as drummer) a new edition of the British chart-topping pop/funk band Level 42 and did so early in 1988 while still holding down work touring work with Allan Holdsworth (who also toured with Level 42 having recorded the 'Guaranteed' album with them). He recorded two studio albums with the group during his tenure (Staring at the Sun and Guaranteed) and left the band in March 1992. In 2000, he rejoined Level 42 frontman and bassist Mark King briefly in his group and then on a session basis went on to perform again on tours as part of a reformed Level 42 line-up before finally leaving a few years later following the release of the band's Retroglide album of 2006. Husband has enjoyed a longtime friendship with Mark King and has supported him on his solo projects, notably 'Mark King and Friends' where Husband played keyboards.

== Acknowledgements ==
Gary Husband's proficiency on both drums and keyboards has received praise from other musicians and critics. In 2017, Gavin Harrison of Porcupine Tree referred to him as "a great, amazingly talented musician! ... He's off the charts talented, this guy. I don't know anyone else in the world who can play piano at that level, and drums at that level". Music critic John Fordham of The Guardian considers him one of the best British musicians in the contemporary post-bop scene, describing Husband's pianistic style as "an onrush of long-lined phrases and ambiguous harmonies boldly adapted from Herbie Hancock and Bill Evans."In 2011, when asked to recommend modern drummers to a drumming magazine, Bill Bruford of King Crimson mentioned Gary Husband, stating that "anything Gary plays on is great" and concluding that he is among the "players [who] are helping push the boundaries of how things should be." Pat Mastelotto said that Husband is an "inspiration to every drummer." Other drummers who have cited him as an influence or expressed admiration for his drumming work are Tomas Haake of Meshuggah. Sean Reinert of Cynic, Peter Wildoer of Darkane, and Rick Colaluca of Watchtower.
