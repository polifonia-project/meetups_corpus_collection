== Early life ==
Khan grew up in North London and learned to play the piano as a child. He studied Economics at the University of East Anglia. During his 20s, he lived in Cuba for a while, which led to him being interested in Afro-Cuban music.

In 1999, Khan set up the Afro-Cuban funk jazz band Motimba. The lineup of Motimba included Justin Thurgur (trombone), Graeme Flowers (trumpet), Oreste Noda (percussion), Jimmy Martinez (bass), Javier Camillo (vocals), Phil Dawson (guitar), and Tansay Ibrahim (drums).

Lokkhi Terra have released two albums to date.
