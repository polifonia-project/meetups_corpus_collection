Dumb Numbers is the musical project of Adam Harding. Lou Barlow, Dale Crover, Bobb Bruno (of Best Coast) and others contributed to the first two studio albums.  The band's roster for live shows fluctuates depending upon the touring schedule of members.  Personnel who consistently appear onstage during Dumb Numbers shows include Harding, Murph (of Dinosaur Jr.), Bonnie Mercer, and Steve Patrick.  They joined My Bloody Valentine as an opener to promote their debut record.  David Lynch (Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks) did the cover art for the first LP and Malcolm Bucknall provided artwork for the second album. Lynch and Harding released a seven inch split together on Joyful Noise Recordings in 2015. David Yow (Jesus Lizard) directed a video for the debut album's single which appeared at Rolling Stone.
Harding's native country is Australia. He began making music in the mid-90's. Prior to the debut of Dumb Numbers, Harding was better-known as a videographer (having directed music videos for DJ Shadow, Warpaint, Best Coast, Swervedriver, Sebadoh, Lou Barlow, and Magic Dirt). However, many of the albums contributors were already established as independent musicians.
A genre-defying act, Dumb Numbers musical style has been described variously as doom, sludge, and "swooning feedback pop," however there is general agreement that none of these labels are definitive.
