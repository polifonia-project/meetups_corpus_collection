Andreas Moe (born 2 October 1988) is a Swedish singer, songwriter, record producer and multi-instrumentalist.


== Biography ==
Moe was born and raised in Stockholm and aspired to be a singer and songwriter from an early age. He grew up listening to the likes of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Michael Jackson, and in later years developed an interest in the acoustic guitar driven sounds of Jeff Buckley. Having played his early writings in virtually every youth centre and bar in Stockholm, Moe earned his place as session guitarist with Bosson and Ulrik Munther. He continued to develop as a producer and artist, and in January 2011 signed a UK publishing deal with Phrased Differently, followed swiftly by a management deal with Hiten Bharadia and Luke Williams. He just signed a record deal with Sony for Scandinavia and continues to self release throughout the rest of the globe.

=== Artist career ===
In July 2011, Moe recorded his first feature on the Avicii track "Fade into Darkness". The song reached number 4 in the Swedish Singles Chart (Sverigetopplistan) - and achieved further success in Poland & Netherlands. The song was also destined for UK release - before it became wrapped up in controversy - after Leona Lewis released a similar version of the track's instrumental under the name Collide. Avicii later claimed that Lewis's record label, Syco, had "stolen" his idea without his permission. Lewis and Avicii eventually settled in court, coming to an amicable mutual agreement to release the song as a collaboration between Lewis and Avicii - meaning that Fade into Darkness was dropped as a UK release.In December 2011, Moe co-wrote and featured on the platinum selling John De Sohn track 'Long Time'. The song, which charted at number 36 in the Swedish Singles Chart (Sverigetopplistan), was released again in April 2012 on Tiesto's compilation album Club Life: Volume Two Miami - which charted worldwide, reaching Number 1 in the US Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums, Number 6 in the UK Album Chart, and Number 3 in the Swiss Album Chart - as well as charting high in many other territories. Soon after, it was revealed that 'Long Time' had been picked up by LA Reid at Epic Records US as a single and was to be serviced to radio on 20 May 2012. The song was released as a single in the US later on in the year.
In May 2012, Moe announced via his Facebook page that his first EP Collecting Sunlight was scheduled for digital release on the UK iTunes Store, and also Spotify, on 25 June 2012.
