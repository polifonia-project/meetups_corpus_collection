In 2007 he was awarded Kongsberg Jazzfestival's talent scholarship.

Svendsen is also noted for his work with several (2-3) bows at the same time, and also playing with his feet. Quoting from one of his essays from his website, "The body of the instrument and our own body is the ingredients that make up sound, so there is always an aspect of physicality involved, sometimes obvious, sometimes not so much ... I am trying to utilize my body in its current condition to create music that is genuine for this exact time and space...Hands, feet, cheek, head, mouth, voice, arms, legs."He has worked with Paal Nilssen-Love, Susana Santos Silva, Arild Andersen, Per Oddvar Johansen, Akira Sakata, and Jørgen Mathisen.
