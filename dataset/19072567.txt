Tad Kubler is an American guitarist, known for his work with Lifter Puller, Song of Zarathustra, and, most-notably, The Hold Steady.  He previously worked with Brett Johnson, bass player for Atmosphere, in the band Ten-fold Hate, in Minneapolis. He grew up in Janesville, Wisconsin and currently lives in Brooklyn, New York.


== Education ==
Kubler was considered bright and energetic but difficult to handle by most of his high school teachers before he was diagnosed with ADD. He spent a year in college with a major in music at University of Wisconsinâ€“Rock County before dropping out to move to Madison.


== Influences ==
Kubler grew up listening to bands like Queen, Led Zeppelin, Kiss, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Thin Lizzy, ZZ Top and, perhaps most importantly, Cheap Trick. When he was seven years old, Cheap Trick's manager of the time had a wife and two daughters who lived across the street, giving Kubler the opportunity to meet Rick Nielsen.
