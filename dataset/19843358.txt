The family migrated to Australia in the early 1960s. He attended Lyndale High School and joined a local group, Sayla, on guitar with John Lee on drums.In March 1973 James (ex-Clydehouse, Sayla) joined harmony pop group, Mississippi to replace Kerryn Tolhurst on lead guitar, alongside Beeb Birtles on guitar and vocals, Graham Goble on guitar and vocals, Derek Pellicci on drums and Charlie Tumahai on bass guitar. He played on the band's hit single, "Will I" (early 1974), and was part of their appearance at Sunbury Pop Festival in January 1974. Mississippi sailed to the United Kingdom in April 1974, working on the Sitmar Line ship, Fairsky, but stagnated there soon after arriving. Back in Australia James left the group in June, while Birtles and Goble reconstituted the band, with Pellicci, in early 1975 recruiting new members and changing their name to Little River Band.James, on guitar, joined progressive rock group, Ariel, in July 1974, in Melbourne, with former bandmate, Lee on drums, Bill Putt on bass guitar and Mike Rudd on guitar and vocals. He returned to the UK with that group in October, where they recorded their second album, Rock & Roll Scars (1975), at Abbey Road Studios. They returned to Australia in early 1975, by which time the band had added a fifth member, singer-guitarist, Glyn Mason. That line-up recorded another album, Goodnight Fiona (1976) and issued a single, "I'll Take You High", in January of that year.James joined a pop band, Sherbet (also performed as Highway and as the Sherbs), in Sydney in early 1976 to replace Gunther Gorman (ex-Home), on lead guitar, backing vocals and slide guitar.

James co-wrote subsequent singles, "Rock Me Gently" (1976), "Beg Steal and Borrow" (1978) and "Angela" (1979), with various band members. He remained with the group until late 1982. James returned to Sherbet for various reunions (including some alongside original guitarist, Clive Shakespeare).In 1979, during Sherbet's hiatus, he was a member of Marc Hunter and the Romantics, which backed Hunter on his solo album, Fiji Bitter (November 1979), and for the associated tour to promote it. In 1982, after leaving Sherbet, James became an original member of the Party Boys, a Sydney-based cover versions group, with Graham Bidstrup on drums, Kevin Borich on lead guitar, Paul Christie on bass guitar, drums and backing vocals and James Reyne on lead vocals (on loan from Australian Crawl).
