Born into a family of musicians in Mulhouse, France (then in the German Empire), Münch was the son of conductor Eugen Münch and the nephew of organist and choral conductor Ernst Münch (1859-1928). He began his musical training with his father before pursuing studies in the organ and music theory with Albert Schweitzer. In 1912 he moved to Basel, ultimately becoming a naturalized citizen of Switzerland. He studied at the Basel Conservatory with Emil Braun (cello), Adolf Hamm (organ), and Hans Huber (composition).
From 1914-1916 Münch was a cellist in the Basel Symphony Orchestra. In 1918 he joined the faculty of the Basel Conservatory where he taught piano through 1932. He served as the director of the conservatory from 1935-1947. One of his notable students was Armando Santiago.
From 1921-1926 Münch conducted the Bach Choir in Basel, after which he was active directing various choral societies in the city like the Basel Gesangverein and the Basel Liedertafel. From 1935-1966 he conducted the Allgemeine Musikgesellschaft in Basel. He died in Basel at the age of 90.
