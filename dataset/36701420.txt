Ganesh Lal was born in Bhimphedi, Makwanpur District to father Madhav Lal and mother Chandra Kumari Shrestha. His first wife Chandra Maya died in 1948, and he was married a second time in 1956 to Narayan Devi.
Bhimphedi, located 35 km to the southwest of the Nepalese capital Kathmandu, is a market town on the old trade route linking India and Tibet. Ganesh Lal's family owned a store shop which sold general merchandise and cloth. Ganesh Lal looked after the shop and spent his free time composing songs. During festivals, he took part in stage performances and music recitals.
Bhimphedi began to wither after the district headquarters was shifted to Hetauda. Subsequently, Ganesh Lal moved there and opened a cloth shop. He died in Hetauda.
In 1999, a statue of Ganesh Lal was erected on the premises of Nepal Bhasa Khala in Hetauda.
