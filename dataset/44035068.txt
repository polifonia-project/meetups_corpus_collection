The group became the first gospel choir in history to include women. This and distinct sound made the group popular in the 1920s and 1930s.When the Claborns left in 1925, GT and Lena began training 4-year-old Jackson Brock and 3-year-old Rosa Nell to be musicians.  Mary eventually joined the group in the late 1920s and brother Ben (born 1930) joined in the mid-1930s. Mary left the group in 1954 after she married.
