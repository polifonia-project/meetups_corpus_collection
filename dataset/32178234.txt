== Early life ==
At the age of eight years old, Arty's grandmother insisted that he should attend music school, from which he successfully graduated aged just fourteen. After that he considered applying for music college, but eventually decided against it, as the chance of becoming a professional pianist was really small and because he no longer enjoyed playing. Instead he learned to use FL Studio sequencer, and his love of video games and electronics led to his keen interest in production equipment. Eventually, he began to be influenced by artists such as The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers and The Crystal Method. After graduating from the Saratov State University with a degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, Arty decided to seriously commit to electronic music.

Together with releasing trance track "This Night Is Ours" on 3 February 2017, Arty posted a letter on Facebook written to his listeners. "Closer to the end of last year[2016] I noticed how much my music was different from what I’ve done in the past, and I felt like I had been neglecting my long-time fans and it didn’t feel fair. And that’s how I came up with idea of bringing the Alpha 9 alias back," wrote Arty in his letter.
He then moved towards the tropical house genre with his release of single "Falling Down" featuring American singer Maty Noyes on 27 February 2017. The track also features a 'Night Mix' version where "Falling Down" is mixed into a future bass track for festival play.

On 7 September 2017, he released "Supposed to Be" on Martin Garrix's record label, STMPD RCRDS. "Working on this record was an unbelievable experience. The lyrics are so meaningful and powerful that I wanted to make sure that all of the instruments I was using were reflecting the overall significance of the song," stated Arty when asked about the track.Arty's first release of 2018, "You and I", was released under his Alpha 9 alias on 12 January 2018. He released "Sunrise" on 19 January 2018, which marks his second release on label Armada Music since his collaboration, "Nehalennia", with Armin van Buuren in 2013. "It's important for me to continue making the music I enjoy the most and 'Sunrise' definitely falls into that category. It’s both a milestone and an incredibly important track in my career as I get back to my Progressive House roots," wrote Arty along with the track's release. Arty released "Rain" through Armada Music on 30 March 2018. "No Going Back", a collaboration produced under Alpha 9 with Spencer Brown, was released on 5 April 2018, followed by "All We Need" on 20 April 2018.

Next, Arty released "Perfect Strangers" through Armada Music on 28 September 2018, a track he has labelled as one of his "favourite" songs to produce within the year.
