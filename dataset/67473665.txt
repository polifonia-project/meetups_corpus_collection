== Dispute over Cro-Mags Domain Name ==
Cro-Mags domain name ownership was a matter of dispute when Savoia NYC, an entity related to Harley Flanagan, filed the complaint with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). As Domain Name Wire states: " Mayhew was co-owner of an entity with Flanagan that held a trademark for Cro-Mags when he registered the domain name in 1999." However WIPO rejected to grant domain name to Flanagan citing abuse of policy. As a result, Mayhew remained the owner of the original Cro-Mags website.
