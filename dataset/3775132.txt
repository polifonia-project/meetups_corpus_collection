Frank R. Strozier Jr. (born June 13, 1937) is a jazz alto saxophonist.
Strozier was born in Memphis, Tennessee, where he learned to play piano. In 1954, he moved to Chicago, where he performed with Harold Mabern, George Coleman, and Booker Little (like Strozier, they were from Memphis). He recorded with the MJT + 3 from 1959–1960 and led sessions for Vee-Jay Records.
After moving to New York, Strozier was briefly with the Miles Davis Quintet in 1963 (between the tenures of Hank Mobley and George Coleman) and also gigged with Roy Haynes. After moving to Los Angeles, he worked with Chet Baker, Shelly Manne, and the Don Ellis big band. Returning to New York in 1971, he worked with Keno Duke's Jazz Contemporaries, the New York Jazz Repertory Company, Horace Parlan, and Woody Shaw.
