== Work ==
The essence of the Macedonian music folklore is the basis of his creative preoccupation. He transfers the folklore into an entirely new quality, at the same time giving it a new dimension of universality. Characteristic for his creative works is that he doesn't use just any folklore idiom, but the one of the rustic singing, which offers enormous opportunities for specific harmonic treatments through multi-layer accord sounding and polyphonic conducting of the structure. Stojkov doesn't focus on one stylistic region. He is in a continuous search for new sounds and soundings, which arouse from the way of using the selection of folk and classical instruments.
He is member of several international organizations and forums, giving huge contribution to the development and the affirmation of the Macedonian music culture. His compositions have been performed in over 20 countries, among which are all Balkan and European countries, USA, Canada, Russia and others, and everywhere they attracted particular interest. Famous domestic and foreign choruses have Stojkov's compositions on their permanent repertoire, and often won awards on international level. All this distinguishes him as one of the most productive and recognizable Macedonian composers, affirmed locally and internationally. Most of his creative works are published on sound carriers.
Professor Stojkov has won several awards and expert recommendations for his social and professional work, among which is the Macedonian highest state award "11 October". Today Stojan Stojkov is full-time professor on the Faculty of Music Art in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.
