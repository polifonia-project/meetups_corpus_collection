Anthony "Anto" Drennan (born on 1 November 1958 in Luton, England) is an Irish guitarist noted for his involvement with the Corrs, Genesis and Mike + the Mechanics among others.
Drennan is from a musical Irish family and was born in Luton, England: he and his family moved back to Ireland while he was at a young age. He grew up in County Dublin and attended Kilmacud National School.
Drennan became a touring lead guitarist for the Corrs from late 1995 and onwards. He was chosen as the touring second guitarist/bassist for Genesis on their 1998 Calling All Stations tour (replacing long-time live band member Daryl Stuermer). In 2010 he was hired as a member of the revived Mike + the Mechanics. He has also played with Clannad, Paul Brady, Moving Hearts, Chris Rea, Davy Spillane, the Liffey Light Orchestra, the Ronnie Drew Band and other well-known Irish bands and performers.
