Consuelo Villalón Alemán (24 May 1907 – 8 November 1998) was a well-known Mexican pianist during the 20th century. She is remembered for her professional interpretation of Frédéric Chopin's music.


== Early life ==
Born in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Villalón moved at the age of 8 with her family to Mexico City (Distrito Federal). There she started professional piano lessons with composer Manuel M. Ponce. At the age of 9 she began teaching piano.


== The genius ==
Although the name of Manual M Ponce gave her some reputation later in her curriculum, in fact the moment of the development of her genius was with Luis Moctezuma.
She took piano lessons with him in his Academy and later in at Escuela Nacional de Musica (UNAM).
She was very different of her professor, who was a nervous person in front of the public. Consuelo Villalon in concert was a great pianist without fear of the piano; at one time she was called "The Mexican Rubinstein" in honor to Arthur Rubinstein.


== Teaching career ==
As a teenager she started taking classes with Professor Luis Moctezuma, then head of the Piano Department at the Escuela Nacional de Música, UNAM. In 1952 Villalón assumed his position upon his recommendation. She also taught privately until the age of 89.
She died at the age of 91, in Mexico City.
