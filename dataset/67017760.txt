The madjlis played a big role in the lively musical life of Medina, in which the musicians performed and attracted patrons and students.She was renowned for her high artistic achievements as well as for her acts as an educator of celebrated male musicians. One of her students was the musician Ma'bad (d. 743), the son of an enslaved African, said of her "in the art of music Djamila is the tree and we are the branches".Djamila performed a pilgrimage from Medina to Mecca, which was a musical event which attracted great attention and extensively commented on by contemporary accounts.
