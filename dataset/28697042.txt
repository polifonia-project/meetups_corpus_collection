== Career ==


=== chickfactor ===
O'Hara co-founded chickfactor magazine in 1992 with indie-pop singer Pam Berry (Black Tambourine, glo-worm, The Pines, Bright Coloured Lights, the Shapiros, etc.). chickfactor staged marathon indie-pop parties at several East Coast venues. The fanzine/magazine championed British pop that was otherwise neglected or disregarded by US mainstream pop critics. It also covered British/c-86 bands like The Wedding Present (whose frontman David Gedge inspired the first issue of chickfactor), Heavenly, Pooh Sticks, and Saint Etienne, as well as US indie bands like Unrest, Tiger Trap, Small Factory, Honey Bunch, Pavement, and the Slumberland scene. chickfactor featured the comic Pavement Boy by Shawn Belschwender. chickfactor ran in print from 1992–2002 and also exists as a blog. A new paper issue, chickfactor 18, was published in 2018 and chickfactor continues to set up small festivals around the world.


=== Photography ===
O'Hara’s photos are on the cover/artwork of The Magnetic Fields 69 Love Songs, as well as on records by The Clientele, Dump, The Pacific Ocean and the Would-Be-Goods, among others. After moving to New York in 1992, she started taking photos of musicians for chickfactor and other publications. Through this she has amassed an archive of images of indie musicians, artists and writers. O'Hara is one of the models on the cover of The Magnetic Fields' Get Lost as well. Her photos have appeared in the New York Times, The Times, the Washington Post, the Washington City Paper, Time Out, Time Out NY, CMJ, the Village Voice, Magnet, LGNY, Pulse, Rockpile, HX, Billboard and several books: Our Noise: The Story of Merge Records and 69 Love Songs: A Field Guide.

O'Hara co-directed and co-produced Strange Powers: Stephin Merritt and the Magnetic Fields (2010), along with co-director/co-producer Kerthy Fix.
