== Biography ==
Jones was born in Paducah, Kentucky on August 7, 1890. By the early 1910s, he had relocated to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he was known as a street singer and one-man band who played in many different styles and for black and white audiences. Jones became known for playing a stovepipe in the same manner as a jug, as well as wearing a stovepipe hat; contributing to his later nickname.In 1924, Jones made his recording debut for Gennett Records. While playing in the streets of Cincinnati, Jones had adopted the nickname "Daddy Stovepipe", in reference to his stovepipe playing. Jones wished to be billed as "Daddy Stovepipe" on his records, however, Chicago based blues musician Johnny Watson had coincidentally recorded under that name six days prior. Jones then chose to adopt the name Stovepipe No. 1, perhaps as a way to brand himself as the 'original'. Jones also recorded under the name "Stovepipe Jones", "Stovepipe Jazz Band", and "Sam Jones". None of Jones' Gennett recordings were issued.A few months later, Jones recorded for Columbia Records in New York City. He recorded 20 sides in these sessions, only six of which were issued, on both the Columbia and Harmony labels. The issued songs show a variety of music styles, from gospel to folk music.Jones returned to the studio in 1927, being accompanied by blues guitarist and singer David Crockett. Crockett was a more sophisticated guitar player than Jones, who became a regular recording partner throughout the remainder of his recording career. In these sessions, they recorded 6 sides, four of them being issued by Okeh Records. This was Jones' last session where he was given leading credit.
Jones may have also recorded with Bob Coleman's Cincinnati Jug Band during the 1920sIn 1930, Jones and Crockett, along with a group of unidentified musicians, entered the studio under the name "King David's Jug Band". The band recorded 6 sides for Okeh, all of which were issued. This was the last time Jones recorded.It is not known when Jones died. He is remembered as being alive in the 1960s.
