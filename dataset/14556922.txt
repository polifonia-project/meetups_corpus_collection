Jon McClure (born 22 December 1981), known as The Reverend, is an English musician. He is the lead singer and frontman of Reverend and The Makers, and ex-vocalist of 1984 and Judan Suki. He says that the name "Reverend" became his moniker because "I'm a big mouth and always running on at people".


== Early life ==
McClure was born in the Sheffield suburb Grenoside, and grew up there with his parents and brother Chris. He has known Ed Cosens since childhood and in Notre Dame High School. He went on to become a poet, and began blogging on the internet.


== Early career ==


=== Judan Suki ===
McClure's first band was Judan Suki, which featured Ed Cosens and Laura Manuel from The Makers. The name Judan Suki is Japanese, meaning "being kicked in the weak spot". The band had around 10 members, including Alex Turner and Matt Helders of the Arctic Monkeys. Judan Suki played around Sheffield, headlining venues such as the Boardwalk and The Foundry Sheffield at Sheffield University in 2002. One of their live tracks included a cover of "Brothers on the Slide" by Cymande, although a studio version was never recorded.


=== 1984 ===
In 2003, Judan Suki downsized from eight members to five to become 1984, named after the novel by George Orwell. Ed Cosens remained in the band, and co-wrote many of 1984's songs as well as all of Reverend and The Makers. The short-lived band existed from 2004 to 2005, and McClure's lyrics and vocals became angrier during this period due to his strong opposition to the Iraq War. "God Is In The TV", one of the B-sides on a later Reverend and the Makers single, was originally a 1984 song. The band came to an end when McClure decided to pursue a more professional career, leading to Reverend and the Makers.


=== Collaboration with Alex Turner ===
McClure developed a close friendship with Alex Turner of Arctic Monkeys, after meeting Turner on a bus and asking if he wanted to join his band at the time. McClure and Turner have co-written songs including "He Said He Loved Me", "The Machine", and "Old Yellow Bricks", and also shared a flat.
