Ian Pooley (born Ian Pinnekamp in 1973) is a German record producer and DJ. While incorporating samples of various musical genres, Pooley's creations are usually classified as house or tech house with Brazilian influence.


== Biography ==
Pooley's music career began in 1993. Fascinated by producers in Chicago and Detroit, he brought his first machines and immediately started writing house and techno music, which kickstarted a multi-decade-spanning career playing to hugely diverse audiences. In 1998, Pooley made his sole appearance on the prestigious BBC Radio One Essential Mix, which featured tracks by Slam, Jeff Mills and his own productions. After a long stretch with V2 Records, in which Pooley released several very successful albums (Meridian and Since Then), Pooley left V2 and started his own record company, Pooled Music, in 2003.Ian Pooley has also cited on various albums (such as Brazilution 5.3 and Souvenirs) that he had an audible 'click' when listening to Brazilian music at a night club.  As such, a lot of his music has a noticeable Brazilian flavor to it. He has incorporated artists like Rosanna and Zelia and veteran musician Marcos Valle in some of his works.
In addition to original works, Pooley has remixed artists such as Deee-Lite, The Cardigans, Daft Punk, Cirque du Soleil, Carl Cox and Bob Sinclar.
