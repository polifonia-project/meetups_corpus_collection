== Early years ==
Bloem (meaning 'flower' in Dutch) de Wilde de Ligny was born to an Indonesian father and a Dutch mother. They moved location twenty times before settling in Haarlem.

de Ligny's festival performances brought her to the attention of the record company Columbia. In November 1998, under the name Bloem de Ligny, the album Zink was released, produced by Tricky associate and ex-Boomtown Rats guitarist Pete Briquette, with contributions from musician Maarten Veldhuis, and recorded at the Townhouse Studios in London. The album's name derives from de Ligny's name for her own fantasy sea.The record company had high expectations, and the album generally received positive reviews, with many comparing her vocal style to that of Icelandic artist Björk, although de Ligny cites Robert Wyatt as being a bigger influence. The single "Fingiecrookie" was released from the album and the accompanying music video received airplay on a number of music TV channels, but album sales disappointed and she parted company with the record label. de Ligny later moved to Paris for several months, and in the beginning of 2000 studied fine art in Rotterdam.
