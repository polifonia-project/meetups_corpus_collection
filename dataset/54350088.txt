=== 2011-2014: Career beginnings and Mimi Records ===

Renato was born in Guimar√£es, Portugal, in 1991. He attended Soares dos Reis Arts School, where he got his diploma for his studies in video and communication courses. Before beginning his solo career, he served as the lead singer for Portuguese band Finished With My Ex, with whom he worked until its disbandment in 2014. The band released two singles, "Politics Suicide Lovers" and "Boys Boys Boys", with the first receiving moderate radio airplay in radio stations, such as Antena 3.
He was then discovered by Mimi Records, a Portuguese music label, in 2012, with whom he released his first two studio albums, A Loud Silence (2013) and Violent Stomach (2015). A Loud Silence was released digitally under a Creative Commons license. In December 2015, Bandcom created an online poll, "Best Portuguese Album of The Year", in which the album was included and nominated for. Lizzy's Husband debut single, "Petrichor", was first released in the summer of 2013, with its music video premiering on national TV channel RTP, featured on the music show Poplusa.His second studio album, Violent Stomach was released through Mimi Records in January 2015. Renato defines the album as "Very electronic, very rock, very eclectic, with different moods and vibes along the album that will provoke different sensations to different people. An album full of strong songs dedicated to my friends." In a 2017 interview with esQrever, Renato recalled the album as his "Glamour & Lifestyle" album, comparing it to a tabloid magazine, where he explored his sexuality, his experiences with substances, different cultures he got in touch with and new people he met at the time, who introduced him to the wonders of theater production, and "where I am more political in terms of writing and opinion".


=== 2015-2016: Independent releases ===
After three years working with Mimi Records, the two went separate ways for the release of Kinoteatr, Renato's fourth studio album (third at the time), by the end of 2015. The album was postponed for a 2016 release, but only came out in April 2017, when was released independently through the project's Bandcamp page.In 2016, struggling to find a label who could release his music, Renato released Blooms Every May, the project's third studio album, made available for free download through Bandcamp. Renato refers to the album as his "heartbreaking record", explaining he "had never written in such an honest and profound way. Love has always been something I talked negatively up to that point. I'm happy I was able to see it in a different way, from different angles". The album was met with favorable reviews, with Hugo Geada, from Threshold Magazine citing "It's the perfect music to listen to after a long day, when the only thing that comes to you is lying in your bed with your headphones, in the relaxing darkness of your bedroom".By the end of 2016, 5YEARS: The Best Of Lizzy's Husband, a compilation featuring the project's best songs, singles, reworked versions and exclusive new tracks, was made available for free download. The compilation was presented by the single "5YEARS", which served as the lead single, celebrating the five years of the project.
