Joshua William Dun (born June 18, 1988) is an American musician. He is best known as half of the American musical duo Twenty One Pilots, alongside Tyler Joseph, contributing drums, percussion, trumpet and backing vocals. He has also collaborated with a variety of different artists.


== Early life ==
Dun was born in Columbus, Ohio, to Laura Lee Dun (née McCollum), a hospice social worker, and William Earl "Bill" Dun, a physical therapy assistant. He grew up with two sisters and a brother named Jordan.
Dun mainly listened to punk rock when he was younger. His parents used to set strict rules on what type of music Dun was allowed to listen to. Regarding the matter, he said: "I'd hide albums like Green Day's Dookie underneath my bed... Sometimes they'd find them and get real mad. They'd find a Christian alternative, like Relient K, and make me listen to that."Dun initially took trumpet lessons at school and then turned to drums, teaching himself how to play. One method Dun references was imitating the beats of the records he'd buy on an electronic drum kit.Dun worked at Guitar Center for three years where he met former Twenty One Pilots drummer Chris Salih, who introduced him to future bandmate Tyler Joseph.
