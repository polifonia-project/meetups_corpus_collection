Mark Andrew White (born 1 April 1961) is an English singer, songwriter, composer, musician and record producer.
Born in Sheffield, England, White first entered the music industry in the late 1970s as lead singer and keyboardist of the electronic band Vice Versa. After releasing one album with the band in 1980, Vice Versa member Martin Fry emerged as lead singer and the band opted to transform into a new band called ABC. White resigned himself to composing ABC's music while also playing guitar and keyboards before retiring from music after the release of their sixth studio album, Abracadabra, in 1991. As ABC's keyboardist he used a variety of instruments, including the E-mu Emulator, the Yamaha DX7 and the Fairlight CMI.
In 2014, White came out of retirement to reform Vice Versa with Stephen Singleton.


== Music career ==
In the late 1970s, White was a member of ABC's predecessor band, the three-piece electronic band Vice Versa. Other members of the trio were David Sydenham and future ABC saxophonist Stephen Singleton. After being interviewed by future ABC lead singer Martin Fry for his fanzine, Modern Drugs, the band members invited Fry to join the band as a keyboardist, and Vice Versa later evolved into ABC.With Fry in place as lead singer and songwriter, Vice Versa changed its name to ABC and changed its sound to a contemporary pop style that at that time led them to be categorised with bands like Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet and the Human League. Between 1982 and 1991, ABC recorded six studio albums (The Lexicon of Love, Beauty Stab, How to Be a ... Zillionaire!, Alphabet City, Up and Abracadabra) and released a greatest hits compilation album, Absolutely. Together with Fry, White co-wrote and produced a couple of songs on Paul Rutherford's 1989 solo album Oh World, including the single "Get Real". During this time, the band went through numerous personnel changes, with White and Fry being its only permanent members.


== Later years ==
ABC disbanded in 1992, with White retiring from music to pursue an interest in Reiki therapy. ABC reformed in 1997 without White, and Fry continued to tour under the band's name despite being its only official member. White declined to participate in VH1's Bands Reunited in 2004, when attempts were made to reform ABC for a one-off performance.
In 2014, White, together with Singleton, compiled the Vice Versa box set, Electrogenesis 1978â€“1980 which was released on VOD Records. This led to White coming out of retirement to reform the band. In December 2015 the duo released a Christmas single called "Little Drum Machine Boy", which was available to download for free on SoundCloud. They are currently writing and recording new material.
