Candye was accepted into the University of Southern California's music conservatory's junior opera program in 1976, but she disliked opera and dropped out.

She started country punk bands and befriended and shared the stage with musicians as diverse as Black Flag, Social Distortion, James Harman, The Circle Jerks, Los Lobos, The Blasters and Lone Justice. In 1985, she caught the attention of CBS/Epic A&R Head, Larry Hanby. She was signed to a developmental deal and recorded her first demo with Grammy winner Val Garay. Kane was marketed as a country singer, but CBS dropped her upon learning of her controversial past.At 17, Kane became pregnant with her first son. In 1986, she moved from Los Angeles to San Diego. She married bass player Thomas Yearsley (of rockabilly power trio The Paladins), with whom she had another son.
