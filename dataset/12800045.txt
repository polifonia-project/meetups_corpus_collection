Thomasina Winslow is an American blues musician from the Albany, New York area, and the daughter of folk musician Tom Winslow.  As a toddler, she sang back-up on her father's folk music classic Hey Looka Yonder (It's The Clearwater); also singing a solo version of One-Two-Three, another version of which she produced on her own 30 years later.  In addition to her solo career, Winslow has been a member of four bands, including a duo with Nick Katzman.  Furthermore, she has been a teacher in that genre of music, and has significantly influenced other aspiring musicians.  Winslow primarily performs covers of Blues standards and has written a number of blues and gospel tunes in her own right.  She is also one of a handful of African-American women producers in the "indy" music industry today.
While she has been teaching a full load of school and private students for over a decade, her primary notability has been from touring in the eastern United States and Europe with Katzman, starting in 2006.
Winslow continues to tour on and off.  On May 6, 2011, she again played with Nick Katzman at Katzman's "favorite U.S. venue," The Good Coffeehouse Music Parlor (GCMP), located in  Brooklyn, New York. This marks the third time that the coffee house has hosted Winslow.  She took another tour of Europe in the summer of 2011, marking her French debut.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Thomasina Winslow grew up in New Baltimore, New York, south of Albany.  Something of a child prodigy, she was nicknamed "Tunes" by her brother. She first performed on her father's album Tom Winslow, singing 1-2-3 (One-Two-Three) as a toddler.  She also sang back-up that year on the folk music classic Hey Looka Yonder (It's the Clear Water) (It's the Clearwater), about the Sloop Clearwater.
As part of her family's group, The Winslows, she toured throughout the folk music festival circuit, including The Great Hudson River Revival.

She has been playing covers of Blues and gospel music at solo gigs, which have included the Cambridge Inn in Cambridge, New York, and the Red Lion Inn in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.  She also played in the 1990s in concerts with Two Story Tuesday and Bojembe around upstate New York, including Glens Falls, Albany, and Colonie.Winslow's day job is that of a music and performing arts teacher at Saint Anne Institute, a reform school for girls, where she administers the "Expressive Arts" program.  She was quoted as saying
"Teenagers have a lot to express, especially children-at-risk. But they haven't always been directed as to how to do that. We try to help them."  Funding for this program was a Youth Advancement Through Music and Art (YATMA) grant. In addition to the Expressive Arts award, she has won numerous other grants, including a New York State Education Department grant.


== Solo tours ==

== Bojembe ==
Winslow was a guitarist, co-lead singer, and musician in the R&B band, Bojembe.  The other members were John Zumbo, Sean Mack, and Terry Plunkett.  They produced one album in 2005–2006 before the band became inactive, but is still sold online.  Most of the songs from the CD can be purchased in MP3 format.  Bojembe's most recent public gig was at the River Street Beat Shop in Troy, New York, for which a blogger wrote that "Winslow's roots are in the deep folk-blues tradition, (while) her work with Bojembe leans toward a decidedly funky groove with a world music spin."


== Management and production ==
As a business woman, Winslow manages and produces music for herself and other artists in a variety of music.  She is one of the few African-American woman today producing records for indie artists, including herself.
She is the owner of a production company, Winslow Productions.  As part of her production work, Winslow also mentors up-and-coming performing artists.Winslow was, for a while, an artistic agent.  She has also collaborated with a local visual artist, Kim Morris, for a concert and art show.Winslow's music is sold on Amazon.com  and other online sales web sites, such as CDBaby.  Due to the nature of the blues market today, as a musical tradition outside the mass market, Winslow's albums have not "charted".  Sales of music she has performed or produced has sold more outside the United States.  This has been especially in England and Germany, where she has performed with Nick Katzman, as well as in Poland,  Denmark, and Latin America.Winslow figured out that music downloads, such as MP3, could actually 'increase' her sales, especially overseas; such a file sharing business model has been documented by Harvard University researchers, as well as in Wikinomics, whose authors call "MP3 b-web."


== Collaboration with Nick Katzman ==
One of Winslow's most fruitful and notable collaborations has been with Nick Katzman.  As related in that article, Katzman has mentored a number of younger blues artists, including Winslow, taking her "under his wing."  The duo has performed recently from Brooklyn, New York to Stamford, England and Berlin, Germany.


=== 2006–2007 Brooklyn gigs ===
In April 2006, Katzman was slated to perform at the Good Coffeehouse Music Parlor in Brooklyn, his favored venue in "the States".  He had previously performed with Ruby Green (Terry Garthwaite), and had recorded Sparking Ragtime & Hardbitten Blues, a now-classic LP, with Green, since released as a CD, so their fans expected they would perform again together. Instead, Winslow substituted for Green; in Katzman's own words:

I was getting my e-mail and was about to zap what I thought was ... spam.... I decided to open it anyway and it turned out to be a letter from a singer/guitarist named Thomasina Winslow who said she was covering tunes from my Kicking Mule LPs on her new CD. Now, mind you, this is NOT an everyday occurrence for me, so I went immediately to CDbaby and listened to her recording. She had a version of "I'm Goin' Away" where she played guitar at least as well as I did and sang wonderfully. I was of course flattered that someone was so involved with my music and very impressed with how well she handled the material. It turns out that she is the daughter of a Gary Davis disciple named Tom Winslow and apparently she grew up around the Davis' scene and was pretty much brought up in a folk-blues household.

She said that I was a primary musical influence
for her, so I've asked her to come and do a guest appearance at the gig,
and she said she'd come all the way down from Albany to do it, so it looks
like we'll be hosting Thomasina Winslow on that night, too. I'm not sure how much
exposure she's had or even how much she's done professionally. The
idea of my music somehow finding its way back to young black musicians is
very exciting for me.

I'll be meeting her for the first time at the gig, so it should be an

interesting night.
Fans of Katzman were once again on notice about a second show in April 2007.


=== 2007 tour with Katzman ===
Winslow flew out to Germany to tour with Katzman in the summer of 2007, when they performed a few gigs in Berlin, Germany and recorded music videos.The duo played at the Stamford Arts Centre 
Blues and Folk Festival, and were the second-billed act for "Guitar Day" ("8.30pm Nick Katzman & Thomasina Winslow 10.00pm Jeff Lang"). It was favorably reviewed in Monty's Music News, an on-line Music newsletter, as a "great evening Concert in The Ballroom."  Blogger Ginger Mayerson called their performances "cute" and "Oh, I just love these trips down memory lane, don't you?", adding "I like the way this singer, Thomasina Winslow, sings."


=== 2008 work with Katzman ===
In April 2008, Winslow and Katzman recorded a song for a future CD.  They also performed together again at the Good Coffeehouse in Brooklyn on April 25, 2008.They received the "Artist of the Day" from the oneartistaday.com website, which celebrates "Independent artists", on October 1, 2008.


=== 2009 tour ===

=== 2010 tour ===

=== 2011 tour ===
