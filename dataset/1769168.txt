== Monsterism ==
The majority of Fowler's art is made in a postmodern cartoon style and often revolves around a central narrative and features a recurring set of characters. The "monsters" Fowler creates all reside on "Monsterism Island". Fowler invents extensive back-stories for his characters; each has its own specific traits and levels of "monsterism". Fowler is most known for his designer toys of his characters, which he himself manufactures with his own company. 
A CD called The Sounds of Monsterism Island was released in 2005 by Heavenly Records. According to the press release, "The record is a compilation album that works as a soundtrack to the world of Monsterism. The album features psychedelic music from the '60s through to today, much of it unearthed and put on CD for the first time."  In 2006, Fowler created a set of comics about Monsterism Island which have been featured in Vice Magazine. 
The second soundtrack to Monsterism Island, A psychedelic Guide to Monsterism Island, was released in 2009 and features mostly new compositions by a host of contemporary musicians.
