Jean-Baptiste de Laubier (born 2 April 1979), known professionally as Para One, is a French electronic music producer and film director.


== Music career ==
Laubier first came to prominence as one of the main producers of French rap group TTC, and was responsible for producing their 2004 signature tune Dans Le Club. With fellow TTC producer Tacteel he made up the now defunct live/improvised electro outfit Fuck-A-Loop (whose only recorded material prior to 2007's nine-hour digital album The Early Aughties was a 2006 remix of Ellen Allien's Down). In 2006, he remixed The Prime Time of Your Life by French house duo Daft Punk. In 2008, Laubier's remix of Ayumi Hamasaki's Greatful Days was released on the album Ayu-mi-x 6: Gold.
Laubier has produced original music for the director Celine Sciamma's films Water Lilies (2007), Tomboy (2011), Girlhood (2014), and Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019). Tomboy featured the song "Always" from Para One and Tacteel's Fair Enough EP.


== Film career ==
Apart from his musical career, Laubier has also worked as a film director. In 2009, he directed the short movie It Was On Earth That I Knew Joy for French brand Sixpack France.
The movie was presented on February 20, 2010 at SCION Installation, Los Angeles.
