== Political views ==
Grandayy has been an outspoken opponent of Article 13 and believed the law could "kill the internet", warning that all broadcasters could face censorship from automated bots. He said "The sad thing is that us YouTubers have no lobby groups or unions that can fight for us and speak to politicians directly for us. Most politicians have no idea about the troubles YouTubers face with copyright, or what type of content the typical YouTuber even produces".
