Brent Wong (born 1945) is a New Zealand surrealist painter and music composer.


== Early life ==
Originally from Otaki, Wong's family moved to Wellington in 1949, where he has subsequently lived. As a child, he had difficulty reading, which led him towards drawing as an alternative means of self-expression.


== Art career ==
Wong's first solo exhibition was in 1969 at the Rothmans Gallery in Wellington when he was 24. The exhibition "excited extravagant critical attention: and overnight established the previously unknown Brent Wong as an important painter in the local context."
