Reyna (stylized as REYNA) is a Milwaukee-based pop duo.


== History ==
Sisters Gabriela "Gab" and Victoriah "Vic" Banuelos grew up in El Paso, Texas. As children, they would sing at their grandmother's shows, as she was a singer in a mariachi band. They continued on to write and record their own songs for guitar and bass from a young age, with encouragement from their father.After one of their songs was used in an episode of Skins, the two decided to take a musical career more seriously. Having moved to Milwaukee, they formed a band together as "Vic and Gab". The local music scene helped Vic and Gab get shows, including playing at an Obama rally in 2012. Vic and Gab reformed as Reyna in 2016, choosing the name based on the Spanish word for "queen", which represents their Mexican-American heritage and their identity as women.Reyna properly formed with the release of first single, "Spill Your Colors". The song was inspired by Vic's experience with coming out as gay. Reyna has since released several singles, with plans to release a two part EP. They prefer focusing on producing songs as singles, as opposed to as albums.Reyna has opened shows for Kesha and Chvrches.
