Unlimited Touch was an American, New York-based post-disco group, most active in the early 1980s. The group's most famous song in its short lifespan was "I Hear Music in the Streets", which made number 6 on US Dance Chart in 1981.


== Overview ==
The group consisted of Audrey Wheeler (lead singer), Phil Hamilton, Tony Cintron, Sandy Anderson, Stephanie James and Lenny Underwood. Raymond Reid and William Anderson from New York-based band Crown Heights Affair instigated Unlimited Touch in the early 1980s, but they were not part of the band. The group was signed to Prelude Records (via Epic Records in the UK).  Charles Richards was the executive producer of the group, and on the album, it was noted that "without him none of it would have been possible".
Due to a major management / label and group dispute, they disbanded by the end of 1981, but re-formed in 1983 with a new line-up of just three of the original members: Wheeler, Anderson, and James. Underwood co-wrote "I Hear Music in the Streets" and "Searchin' to Find the One", which were minor hits in the US Billboard R&B chart. They later released "Yes We're Ready", in 1983, and a further single, "Reach Out (Everlasting Lover)", in 1984.In 1999, producer Sean Combs sampled the bass guitar and drum breakdown of "I Hear Music in the Streets" for the Faith Evans song "All Night Long". Other artists who have sampled "I Hear Music in the Streets" include Paul Johnson, Biz Markie, Rampage, along with Billie Lawrence.
