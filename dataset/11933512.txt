== Biography ==
Steiner was born in Austin, Texas to parents who were both rodeo entertainers. His main goal, however, was to become a country music artist. He began touring throughout the state of Texas, playing various clubs throughout the state. RCA Nashville signed Steiner in 2001, and his debut single, "What If She's an Angel", was released that year, followed by the album Then Came the Night. The single was added to the playlists of nearly 100 of the stations on Billboard's panel in one week. "What If She's an Angel" peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard U.S. Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts. Follow-up singles were less successful, however, and Steiner parted ways with RCA Nashville in December 2002. He has not recorded since.
