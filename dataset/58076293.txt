== Stage name origin ==
A breakout star at only 15 years old, Au/Ra's stage name consists of two elements from the periodic table: "Au" stands for gold, a transition metal with the atomic number 79, while "Ra" stands for radium, a slightly radioactive alkaline earth metal with the atomic number 88. According to Alan Walker's Unmasked Vlog #1 Video on YouTube, Jamie stated that there are already a couple of artists with the first name of 'Aura', and when she chose 'Aura' as her stage name, she decided to put a slash between 'Au' and 'Ra'. She also mentioned that her artist name derives from a Lord of the Rings fanfiction she wrote when she was younger, where the main character was called Aura.
