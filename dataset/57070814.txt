== Controversies ==


=== Mars Argo lawsuit ===
On April 17, 2018, Sinclair's former collaborator and partner Mars Argo filed a lawsuit in Central California court against Sinclair and Poppy alleging copyright infringement, stating that Sinclair based Poppy's online persona on hers, as well as emotional and physical abuse Sinclair had allegedly subjected her to in the period after their separation and the subsequent abandonment of the project. On May 7, Poppy made a public statement about the "frivolous" lawsuit, saying Argo was attempting to manipulate her psychologically. She called the suit a "publicity campaign" and a "desperate grab for fame". It was settled out of court on September 14 "with no money exchanging hands". Argo released a statement in January 2019 that all rights to Mars Argo had been assigned to her as part of the settlement.


=== Poppy ===
On December 29, 2019, Poppy released a statement on Twitter announcing that she parted ways with Sinclair, claiming that he "glamorizes suicide" and used it as a way to manipulate her. An example of this behavior is an instance in which Poppy alleges Sinclair was going to hang himself with one of her personal belongings and had also messaged fans details about his suicidal attempts for attention. She said that Sinclair "lives an illusion that he is a gift to this Earth" and that she was "trapped in a mess that [she] needed to dig [her]self out of." Prior to the statement, Sinclair's directorial credits were removed from recent videos on Poppy's YouTube channel, with his songwriting credits later being removed from several songs on streaming platforms.
