Lewis studied civil engineering for a year before turning to music. His mother was a shop assistant, and his father worked in management for a chemical company. Lewis attended Hawthorn High School in Pontypridd. His favourite subjects were Science and History. His first concert, as a concertgoer, came when he saw Tesla at St David's Hall.

No Devotion's second album is due to be released sometime in the future, although the only members of the band confirmed to be on the album were Geoff Rickly, Lee Gaze and Stuart Richardson.
