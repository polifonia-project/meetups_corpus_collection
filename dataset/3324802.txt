Mick Weaver (born 16 June 1944, Bolton, Lancashire, England) is an English session musician, best known for his playing of the Hammond B3 organ, and as an exponent of the blues and funk.


== Career ==
Weaver's band performed as Wynder K. Frog and became popular on the student union and club circuit of the mid 1960s. A brief merging of this band with Herbie Goins and the Night-Timers took his work to a higher level. Wynder K. Frogg — they are billed under this spelling — appeared on the bill at the Savile Theatre, London on 24 September 1967, supporting Traffic on their first UK presentation. Also on the bill were Jackie Edwards and Nirvana. The compere was David Symonds.
When Steve Winwood left Traffic to form Blind Faith, Weaver was recruited to replace him and Traffic became Mason, Capaldi, Wood and Frog, soon shortened to Wooden Frog. They played a few gigs before dissolving three months later when Traffic reformed. After this he recorded with solo artists such as Buddy Guy, Dave Gilmour, Joe Cocker, Eric Burdon, Frankie Miller, Roger Chapman Steve Marriott and Gary Moore as well as Taj Mahal and The Blues Band, also playing keyboards with Steve Marriott's Majik Mijits.
