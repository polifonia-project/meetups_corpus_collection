== Biography ==


=== Pre-Skid Row ===
Sabo was born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey and grew up in nearby Sayreville, in the same neighborhood as childhood friend Jon Bon Jovi. His mother, Dorothy, raised him and his brothers as a single mother. Inspired by the likes of Kiss, Aerosmith, Judas Priest, Van Halen, Black Sabbath, as well as the Rolling Stones, Sabo began playing guitar at the age of 14 on a $40 Sears guitar his mother had purchased for his older brother years earlier. Sabo was also a promising athlete, even being professionally scouted while a high school baseball player. Seeing Kiss play live as a teenager was the catalyst for Sabo to give up sports and focus on music full time.Sabo's friendship with Jon Bon Jovi led to him becoming the original lead guitarist for Bon Jovi in 1983. Sabo took part in a short three-week tour to support a demo version of Bon Jovi's debut single "Runaway" which became a surprise New York City-area hit in 1983. Sabo's time in Bon Jovi was brief, and he was soon replaced by Richie Sambora as the band's lead guitarist. While working in Toms River, New Jersey, Sabo met local bassist Rachel Bolan and the pair agreed to form a band which would eventually become famous American rock band Skid Row.
