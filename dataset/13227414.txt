D'erlanger (stylized as D'ERLANGER) is a Japanese rock band from Kyoto Prefecture, formed in 1983 by guitarist Cipher and bassist Seela. While they originally played speed and power metal, after recruiting drummer Tetsu and vocalist Kyo they switched to an alternative rock sound for their debut album La Vie En Rose in 1989. Although it was on an indie label, it sold out and was reissued three times that year, earning them a major label record deal with BMG Japan the following year. They released Basilisk in March 1990 and it reached the top five on the charts. However, in December the group suddenly announced their disbandment.
Despite their short time in the spotlight, D'erlanger remain well-known and are considered one of the founders of visual kei. They reunited in 2007 and released the album Lazzaro, with a new harder sound that adds a gothic rock feel. They have since released six more studio albums and toured extensively, including several overseas performances.


== History ==


=== Formation to disbandment: 1983–1990 ===
D'erlanger was formed in December 1983 by Cipher and Seela on guitar and bass respectively.  Vocalist Kaoru and drummer Shi-Do, from the same high school, soon joined to complete the line-up. They had their first performance in May 1984 at the Osaka Bourbon House, when Cipher was just sixteen years old. In August 1984, Kaoru left the band and was replaced by Dizzy.They released 3 demo tapes by 1985, "Tonight", "The Birth of Splendid Beast!!" and "Blue". On October 26, 1986 they participated in an event at Meguro Rokumeikan, called The New Power Metal Audition. Which was organized by Mandrake Root Records to celebrate the first anniversary of the independent label. D'erlanger won the contest and the label released their single "Girl" on February 20, 1987, it was limited to 3000 copies. They also appeared on the live omnibus album Hungry Days, with the song "Like a Beast". They then distributed another demo tape for free on February 22, it contained only "Sadistic Emotion".
On August 1, 1987, D'erlanger had their first one-man concert at Meguro Rokumeikan. Soon after Shi-Do decided to leave the band, he was replaced by Tetsu, who was a roadie for 44Magnum alongside Cipher, in October. Dizzy then left the band in June 1988 and Kyo, who had previously played with Tetsu in the short-lived Dead Wire and in Saver Tiger, became their new vocalist on July 1. In addition to Cipher and Tetsu's connection to 44Magnum, Kyo was also influenced by them and their lead singer Paul.

After their first show with Kyo on July 22, they went on their Sadistical Punk Tour. While touring in 1989, they released their first album La Vie En Rose, with Danger Crue Records on February 10. All copies were sold out just by pre-orders, so they released another press eleven days later. The album's sound was a drastic departure from their previous material, being punk and alternative rock instead of the speed and power metal they originally had. The band then went on the short Incarnation of Eroticism Tour.
The year 1990 started off with the band signing to the major label Ariola, at the time a sub label of BMG. During their Ai to Shi to Koh-Kotsu Tour at the beginning of 1990, they released their first major single, "Darlin'" on January 25. On March 7, they released their second album Basilisk. They released the single "Lullaby -1990-" before starting the Moon and the Memories Tour on September 10. The tour ended on October 31, at Koseinenkin Kaikan in Osaka.
On December 24, 1990, D'erlanger shocked their fans by suddenly announcing that they had disbanded. A home video and two separate live albums entitled Moon and the Memories... the Eternities Last Live 1 and 2 were released on March 6, 1991. All of which were recorded from their penultimate concerts on October 27 and 28, 1990 at Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall in Tokyo.
On April 21, 1995, both their studio albums were remastered and re-released.

== Legacy ==
D'erlanger are often credited as one of the founding acts of Japan's visual kei movement. Tomokazu Nishihiro of Real Sound wrote that by showing influence from metal, punk and early Japanese rock in their music, they affected the sound as well as the image of visual kei. Kiyoharu said that, with band's like Boøwy and Buck-Tick being popular at the time, D'erlanger's mix of "beat rock" with metal was "shocking." Tomoyuki Hokari of OK Music also described their music as taking aspects from beat rock like Boøwy and mixing it with metal like 44Magnum. Nishihiro stated that D'erlanger are still held up as a unique band decades later because each member is distinct and unlike any other musician.Kerrang! included Basilisk on a list of 13 essential Japanese rock and metal albums, writing that its songs "engulfed a generation with a burgeoning erogenous intensity the scene has seldom seen since." Inoran was influenced by D'erlanger as a teenager and has expressed particular admiration for Cipher on several occasions. His Luna Sea bandmate Shinya described D'erlanger as exemplifying all the elements of visual kei and praised Tetsu's drumming. Hyde looks up to D'erlanger, particularly Kyo, whose style he imitates. Dir en grey guitarist Die developed his love of the instrument from La Vie En Rose and called Cipher his "guitar hero."
