Richard Paul Rowe (9 June 1921 â€“ 6 June 1986) was Head of A&R (Singles) at Decca Records from the 1950s to the 1970s.
He is historically presented in popular musical history as the man who did not sign the Beatles. In Brian Epstein's 1964 autobiography, Rowe is quoted as having rejected them with the words: "Guitar groups are on their way out, Mr. Epstein", although he denied ever having said this. He later signed the Rolling Stones after their audition, thanks to an introduction and encouragement from George Harrison.


== Career ==
He was one of the most important producers and record executives in the United Kingdom in the 1950s and early 1960s and is the man who signed the Rolling Stones, Them (Van Morrison), the Moody Blues, the Tremeloes, the Zombies, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, the Brumbeats, the Tornados, Tom Jones, the Small Faces, the Marmalade, Billy Fury, Tommy Steele, The Animals, Cat Stevens, Procol Harum, Kathy Kirby, Gilbert O Sullivan, and the Circus amongst others. Rowe rejected The Beatles (in fact one of his A&R team Mike Smith, brought two deals to Rowe, his boss; Brian Poole and the Tremeloes and the Beatles, and unfortunately he only allowed him to sign one deal, the group that lived near London, who actually had more initial success than the Beatles). However, the Beatles went on to land a recording contract with EMI/Parlophone and become the biggest selling and most influential rock band of all time.
