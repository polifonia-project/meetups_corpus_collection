== Career ==


=== 1997–2000: Drömhus and Melodifestivalen ===
Therese's career started when she called a record company and recorded her singing on their answering machine. When she later met Dr. Alban, he convinced her to join the new eurodance project Drömhus. At first, Drömhus was meant to consist of two men and Therese, but eventually shrank to just Therese and the producers.In 1997, Drömhus's first single "Du och jag" ("You and I") was released. The big breakthrough, however, came in 1998 with the single "Vill ha dig" ("Want You"), a cover of a hit by the band Freestyle in the 1980s.At the Melodifestivalen, the Swedish qualification for Eurovision Song Contest, in 1999, Drömhus competed with the song "Stjärna på himmelen" ("Star in the Sky"). It finished second, thus not qualifying for the European finals. In 2000, Therese announced that she would leave Drömhus to perform under the mononym Therese instead.

Therese's first singles, "Monkey" and "I Need Somebody", were released in 2002, in advance of her debut album Acapulco, released early 2003 on Swedish record label Tretiak.
