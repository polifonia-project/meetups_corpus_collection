"The first time I went ...., I was studying awa drumming, which is like drum ensemble music for a bunch of different instruments." Davis is referring to a music tradition involving the djembe and dunun style of drums. In his first visit he heard of northern Ghanaian tradition of music called Bawa. In 2014 Davis traveled to Ghana with Bridget Kearney of Lake Street Dive and a former member of Cuddle Magic. They spent just over two weeks in the capital Accra, studying the traditional music of Northwest Ghana with master gyil player Aaron Bebe. They subsequently co-released an EP, BAWA, incorporating gyil music as source material. After leaving Ghana, Davis came down with typhoid and was very sick.When Davis and Joan Wasser (Joan As Police Woman) met in 2013, they found they both had an interest in Central African Republic Pygmy music. Davis co-wrote, recorded, co-produced and toured for the album Let It Be You (Reveal Records 2016) with Wasser.
