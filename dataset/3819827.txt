== Biography ==
Richmond was born Charles Daniel Richmond on December 15, 1931, in New York City and grew up in Greensboro, North Carolina. He started playing tenor saxophone at the age of thirteen, and went on to play R&B with the Paul Williams band in 1955.
His career took off when he took up the drums, in his early twenties, through the formation of what was to be a 21-year association with Charles Mingus. Mingus biographer Brian Priestley writes that "Dannie became Mingus's equivalent to Harry Carney in the Ellington band, an indispensable ingredient of 'the Mingus sound' and a close friend as well".That association continued after Mingus' death when Richmond became the first musical director of the group Mingus Dynasty in 1980.
He died of a heart attack in Harlem on March 16, 1988, at the age of 56.On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Dannie Richmond among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.
