Nalini "Deedee" Cheriel is a visual artist, musician and filmmaker who lives in Los Angeles, California.


== Career ==
From the age of 19, Cheriel started out creating record covers and T-shirts for the Oregon music scene. She was a member of the band Adickdid, which was distributed by several labels including Yoyo Records and Kill Rock Stars. She also played in the bands Juned, Teen Angels, and The Hindi Guns.
In 2001, Cheriel, along with friends Kurt Voss and Zoe Poledouris, created the film Down and Out With the Dolls. This film is loosely based on Cheriel's life as a musician and the stories she would tell Voss about this time of her life. After this film was released, Cheriel moved to Los Angeles, California where she lives still.After moving to Los Angeles, Cheriel began work as a visual artist. She has created several paintings which continue on the themes she explored in her music, as well as exploring new ones. The main theme of her art, according to Cheriel, would be the attempts of people to connect to the world around them and to each other. Cheriel's interest in the relationship between man and our natural surroundings is apparent from the abundance of animals in her paintings. Cheriel uses these animals to depict human emotions.
