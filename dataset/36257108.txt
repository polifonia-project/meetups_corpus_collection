As well as serving as gravure idols, the group also sang on the Avex label. The group went on to release a photobook but disbanded soon after, having little success.In 2006, Takasugi made her first live performance at "Rhythm Nation 2006" sponsored by Avex, playing a cover of Yoshiyuki Osawa's "Soshite Boku wa Tohō ni Kureru". The song was later released promotionally on the radio and other media. Takasugi became part of Rhythm Zone, a sub-label of Avex specialising in urban music.
In 2007, Takasugi released her debut single, "Tabibito", which was used as the theme song of the film Saiyuki, inspired by Chinese folk tale Journey to the West. "Tabibito" reached number 10 in the Oricon charts and eventually sold over 40,000 copies. After being invited to participate at "a-nation '07", where Takasaugi was able to perform and promote herself at several places across Japan, she released her second single, "Hyakurenka", which was used as the ending theme of the NTV programs The Sunday and Adult no Shikaku.

In 2010, Takasagi decided to take a different approach with the release of her music, opting to release three singles – "Sakurairo", "Now!", and "Futatsu no Sora" – digitally rather than on the traditional CD format, although all three singles eventually made their way onto her third album.
