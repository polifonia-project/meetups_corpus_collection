== Biography ==
Ackerman began his music career at age 16 with the San Diego, California band Skratchline on Rescue Records playing rhythm guitar alongside Jasun Krebs, former Edge or Mortality guitarist and future member of As I Lay Dying. In 2002–3, Ackerman played rhythm guitar with As I Lay Dying at a number of live performances, including a full U.S. tour after his graduation from San Marcos High School. He did not appear on any of As I Lay Dying's studio recordings from that period, although he provided some backing vocals for their 2007 album An Ocean Between Us.
In 2005, he started the band Chapter 14 with Joel Piper of Confide, Noah Slifka of In Fear and Faith, and Michael Catalano of Destroy the Runner and Chiodos. Ackerman was the band's vocalist and founder. Chapter 14 went on two U.S. tours in 2005 and 2006 with unsigned self releases. In 2006, Ackerman filled in for the band Die Trying on Island Records, playing guitar for three months in Sacramento. The band broke up in the fall of 2007.
In the fall of 2007 Ackerman joined Destroy the Runner as the new vocalist, replacing previous vocalist Kyle Setter. The band did two U.S. tours with Ackerman, promoting their debut record Saints. Destroy The Runner then recorded their second studio album I, Lucifer in Baltimore with producer Brian McTernan. I, Lucifer was released on April 15, 2008 and the band has done three U.S. tours and one European tour promoting the album.
In 2008, Ackerman teamed up with vocalist Tim Lambesis of As I Lay Dying to record Total Brutal, the debut album for Lambesis' comic side project Austrian Death Machine. Ackerman voices all of the "Ahhnold" impersonations on Total Brutal and for the band's bonus disc A Very Brutal Christmas also in 2008.
Ackerman was working on the third Destroy the Runner album set to be released in 2010, but the band has since broken up as stated on their MySpace page. Ackerman has done several interviews about the breakup, and has started up Chapter 14 again with Tanner Sparks (Destroy the Runner bassist). Ackerman was the vocalist of Count Your Curses, a three-piece trip-hop/electro rock group formed in January 2011. The project was a long-distance collaboration between Ackerman, kmotiv (Programming, Synth, and Keyboards) and Sean Sallings (Guitars, Bass, & Percussion); the band self-released three  singles in 2011–2012. Ackerman is also currently producing bands, solo artists, and musicians.
On November 29, 2012 Ackerman announced on his Facebook page that his debut release under the name "A Veil" was on YouTube, and that the album would be free for download or "name your own price" on November 30, 2012. This is Ackerman's first attempt as a singer/songwriter, and the album is entitled The in Between.
On May 30, 2013, the music video for "Tombs" was screened at the Portland Music Video Festival at the historical Hollywood Theater in downtown Portland,OR.
