After her marriage to the dancer Gheorghe Popescu-Județ her interest in Romanian folk dance increased. Together they performed folk dance-inspired choreographies and they won the first prize for character dance in the International Dance Competition at Prague.

From 1949-51, she worked as a researcher at the Folklore Institute in Bucharest (then Institut de Folclor, today Institut de Etnografie si Folclor 'Constantin Brăiloiu'). From 1949 into the 1960s, she frequently accompanied her husband on research trips in the field to study Romanian folk dance
