The relationship was said to have lasted until she turned 18.Meanwhile a second woman accused him of sexual misconduct, specifically for requesting nude pictures from her when she was a minor. The 23-year-old opened up, first meeting Fuentes at Warped Tour 2008. Both exchanged mobile phone numbers and stayed in contact afterwards. When she turned 15, Fuentes requested nude photos from her.The band replied to these accusations in mid December.
