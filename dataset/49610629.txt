She was also released in Taiwan on September 7, 2011, her boxart was reworked for the Taiwan market.  Her voice was well received by Sound on Sound magazine and she was praised as an improvement over previous Vocaloids where she was described as sounding "sassy" who was capable of being used "for a range of supporting vocal tasks".A Vocaloid called "Big Al" was created to act as her counterpart.
Sweet Ann was later used as a reference in the development of the Hatsune Miku English vocal.Sweet Ann's most notable use was in the anime Nichijou.
