== Philanthropy ==
In 1973, Martell's teenage son T.J. Martell was diagnosed with leukemia, and died in 1975 at the age of 21. Tony Martell began fundraising efforts for cancer research with a dinner in New York City featuring the music of friends Buddy Rich, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, and Ella Fitzgerald and soon established the T.J. Martell Foundation in memory of his son.For over forty-three years the foundation has been one of the primary charitable organizations associated with the music industry and a leader in funding for innovative leukemia, cancer, and AIDS research (having raised over $285 million). The T.J. Martell Foundation maintains offices in New York, Los Angeles, and Nashville; and sponsors events nationally and internationally.
Martell retired from the music industry and was involved in the work of the foundation until his death. His status and long-standing relationships to artists and executives within the music community are still invaluable assets to the foundation's work.In 1996, several country music artists recorded a charity single titled "Hope: Country Music's Quest for a Cure", whose proceeds were donated to the foundation in order to aid cancer research. The song featured vocals from John Berry, Terri Clark, Vince Gill, Faith Hill, Tracy Lawrence, Little Texas, Neal McCoy, Tim McGraw, Lorrie Morgan, Marty Stuart, Travis Tritt, and Trisha Yearwood. It was released via Giant Records, and charted at number 57 on Hot Country Songs in May of that year.
