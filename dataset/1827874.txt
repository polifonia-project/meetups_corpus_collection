DeVoe was the second-to-last member to join New Edition (Johnny Gill being the last) after being brought in by his uncle and the group's choreographer, Brooke Payne. In 1981, the group took second place at a talent show which caught the eye of record producer, Maurice Starr, who signed them to his Streetwise record label. New Edition went on to become the biggest-selling boy band group from the mid to late 1980s.
After New Edition's 1990 breakup, DeVoe and fellow New Edition members, Ricky Bell and Michael Bivins, formed the R&B/hip-hop group, Bell Biv DeVoe.

In 1993, DeVoe and the group released their follow-up album, Hootie Mack.
In 1996, DeVoe reunited with the other original members of New Edition which saw the release of the album, Home Again, followed by a world tour ending in 1997.
In 2001, DeVoe and Bell Biv DeVoe released their third album, BBD.
In 2017, DeVoe and Bell Biv DeVoe released their fourth album, Three Stripes.
