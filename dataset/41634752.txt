Runchak wrote a numerous works for instruments and vocal. According to «Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung» V. Runchak found his personal balance between the stylistic and technological limitations and the new freedom. In his works one can hear the courage of the author’s expression which goes far beyond the limit of belonging to any composer’s school.  Often, the avant-garde means are the only means for him.According to N. Krechko, the composer focuses on complex dissonant language, musical expression, innovative techniques associated with sound, atypical spatial-acoustic and timbre-color means ..
Runchak is a bright representative of Ukrainian musical actionism (along with Serhiy Zazhytko, Serhiy Yarunsky, Karmela Tsepkolenko, Lyudmyla Yurina, Ivan Nebesny, Danylo Pertsov and Hryhoriy Nemyrovsky). Instrumental theater for V. Runchak is related to M. Kagel's instrumental theater, and, according to researchers, became a means to draw attention to social problems.
