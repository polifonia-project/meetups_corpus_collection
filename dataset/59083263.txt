== Artistry ==


=== Music style ===
Sagopa Kajmer is a rap music artist. He started his career under the name Silahsız Kuvvet and later used elements of Anatolian melodies and türküs in his songs. Although he initially used curse words in the album Sagopa Kajmer, he later refrained from using them later in his career. He also performed his songs in a tone different than his actual voice to not become famous. His voice is thought to be of Arabesque style. In his 2003 album, Romantizma, there are far more love themes than his previous works.


=== Influences ===
Run-DMC's music was influential in forming Kajmer's rap music. He said that he was influenced by the works of Omar Khayyam, Ferdowsi and Rumi. In an interview with Pembe Newspaper, he said: "When I was little I thought I was Jam Master Jay from Run-DMC. LL Cool J and Fat Boys are also very important names. I got my influence from them." The artist's style change and beard gave rise to the rumors that he was influenced by the philosophy of Ahmet Mahmut Ünlü. The artist, however, firmly denied these allegations and said that it was only after reading a hadith that he decided to let his beard grow.


== Meaning of Sagopa Kajmer ==
Yunus Özyavuz explains the meaning of Sagopa Kajmer with these words:

It's an ancient pyramid in Egypt... and the one who's looking for it is Kajmer. So, the one who's trying to look for something or solve it is trying to find his Sagopa's like Kajmer... one who solves his issues.
On Beyazıt Öztürk and Meral Okay's program Nasıl Yani he said:

A scientist doing research in pyramids in Egypt... all the coordination inside is written in hieroglyph, and then he loses his life during his search. Scientists who came after him discovered that the man who originally found the pyramid, as they read from the papyrus, was a man named Kajmer who discovered the Pyramid of Sagopa. I read this article in my college years.
On 17 November 2015, in response to Mesut Yar's question "What does it mean?" he said:

Mystery ... There is also a tree named Sago in Thailand. A nice palm type. Kajmer means child. Troubled child... This is also of a bit of eastern origin in Avesta.
