In a Q&A session following the premiere, the producers stated that they intend to screen the documentary at film festivals in the following year, and that the documentary would be released on DVD with additional material that was left out due to time constraints.


=== Robert Hunter Cup ===
Melbourne MC Bias B and other members of the hip-hop community planned two events to commemorate Hunter's legacy, both events falling under the name Robert Hunter Cup.  On Saturday, 20 October 2012, a year after Hunter death, a gig was staged in Melbourne featuring artists including Drapht, Dazastah, Layla and Optamus from the Syllabolix (SBX) crew, Funkoars, Brad Strut, Koolism, Boney & Stoney, amongst others.
The following day, an Australian rules football match was played between two teams, Westside Warriors (with players from Western Australia and South Australia) and Eastside Kings (from the states on the east coast), to raise funds for charity foundation Make-A-Wish. The event which was inspired by an impromptu "kick-to-kick" game at a wake near the Melbourne Cricket Ground at the time of Hunter's death. The Eastside Kings (7.8.50) defeated the Westside Warriors (7.4.46) by four points; comedian Scott Dooley was awarded a trophy as "man of the match".

The event was repeated the following year, with the Robert Hunter Cup match played at Victoria Park, Melbourne, on Sunday, 6 October 2013, preceded by another "Aus All Stars" gig the night before. Eastside Kings (8.8.56) again defeated Westside Warriors (7.7.49).
The final Robert Hunter Cup match played in Perth, Western Australia, on 25 October 2014 ended with another victory for the Eastside Kings (8.11. 59) over the Westside Warriors (7.8.50).
