Gregory Stanislaus Bennett Jr. (born November 8, 1977) is an American graphic designer and artist based in York, Pennsylvania, USA. Bennett studied graphic design at the Art Institute of York where he graduated from in 1999. He is best known for his imaginative and highly conceptual branding, corporate identity, packaging and cause-related poster projects.


== Biography ==
In 1999, Bennett moved to Washington DC to practice design with Supon Design Group, one of the nation's leading branding design firms at that time. He trained under Jake and Pum Lefebure who now run their
own design firm known as Design Army.
From 2000 to 2002, Bennett would explore various disciplines within the creative industry in an effort to expand his capabilities. In that time, he worked with Kinetic Studios as a graphic designer, CO2 Media as an interactive designer and Novak-Birch as an environmental designer.
Bennett joined Siquis (an ad agency in Baltimore, MD) in 2002 as a senior designer. He quickly advanced within the agency and was promoted twice, once to design director and ultimately senior design director before moving on in 2011.
Now Bennett produces high-profile projects for a variety of fashion, lifestyle and outdoor clients. His creative offerings include concepting ad campaigns and art directing photoshoots, crafting corporate identities, branding programs and packaging systems.
