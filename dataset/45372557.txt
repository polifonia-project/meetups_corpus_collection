Alien Boys were a German rock band from Hamburg, Germany. They formed in 1987 and were one of the first European grunge bands but also associated with the doom metal genre. After two independent albums and a lot of touring, especially in the United States, they got signed to Gun Records/BMG and released their third album, Doom Picnic, produced by grunge pioneer Jack Endino. After their fourth album, Nekropolis, the group disbanded in 1994.
