Victor Massé (born Félix-Marie Massé; 7 March 1822 – 5 July 1884) was a French composer.


== Biography ==
Massé was born in Lorient (Morbihan) and studied at the Paris Conservatoire, winning the Prix de Rome in 1844 for his cantata Le Rénégat de Tanger before turning his attention to opera. While at the Conservatoire, Massé studied with Jaques Halévy. He wrote some twenty operas, including La Chanteuse voilée (1850), followed by the more ambitious Galathée (1852) and Paul et Virginie (1876). His best-known and most successful work was the opéra comique Les Noces de Jeannette (1853). His last work, Une Nuit de Cléopâtre, was performed posthumously in April 1885.
Massé died in Paris and is buried in Montmartre Cemetery.
