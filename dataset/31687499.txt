A photo-journalist who had covered the band stated that one club date he attended, being reported as a sellout, had almost more people on stage than in the crowd: Mawhinney had purchased all the tickets in advance. Another scheduled appearance for the band at the Roxy in Los Angeles had a DJ on stage in place of Mawhinney, who was at his high school reunion that night, and saw the DJ being served with legal papers intended for Mawhinney during the show.
