== Life and career ==
Born in Muskogee, Oklahoma, and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Ester Dean is the youngest of five children brought up by their single mother Hester, in a low-income household.  At a young age Dean learned how to channel her energy into her music, writing and channeling her emotions into songs. Creative writing served as Dean’s self-therapy.
  The separation made Dean dig deeper for a connection, finding solace in music and the local music scene.  Singing in every studio, writing for local rappers and producers, Dean unknowingly grass-rooted herself.  Learning the ins and outs of her talent and creativity, at 20 years old Dean made a bold move and left Oklahoma with only $500 in her pocket.  She drove 18 hours, alone, to Atlanta, Georgia with dreams of breaking into the music industry.  She sang for anyone who would listen.  While at a Gap Band concert, music producer Tricky Stewart overheard Dean singing in the crowd along with the band. He immediately asked her to set up a meeting. While going through her catalog of songs, Tricky was impressed by not only her voice but also her songwriting ability.  He signed her to a small publishing deal that allowed Dean to grow and connect with other known writers and producers.  This opportunity provided Dean with the tools, tricks, and skills to writing potential Top 40 songs.
Although her time with Tricky was a significant point in her career, Dean eventually parted ways and relocated to Los Angeles, California.
Upon relocating to Los Angeles, Dean began to build a name in the songwriting world.  She was eventually introduced to Polow da Don, and later signed to Zone 4 Records/Interscope Records.In 2009 Dean released her first single, "Drop It Low", which peaked at number 38 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming her first US Top 40 single.
Dean's big break came when she collaborated with super producers Stargate, creating her first number one single, Rihanna’s "Rude Boy".  She went on to write "What's My Name", "Where Have You Been" and several other Rihanna hits, as well as Katy Perry's "Firework" and Nicki Minaj’s "Super Bass" and co-writing "Pills n Potions" with Nicki Minaj.
In 2011, Dean contributed to the soundtrack for the animated film, Rio by Blue Sky Studios.
In 2012, Dean was named ‘The Song Machine’ in an article by John Seabrook. She has written, and sometimes produced, Top 40 hits for scores of artists, including: Rihanna, Christina Aguilera, Florence + The Machine, Beyoncé, Drake, Selena Gomez, Mary J. Blige, Kelly Clarkson, Ciara, The Pussycat Dolls, Usher, Kelly Rowland, R. Kelly, Britney Spears, Lil Wayne, and Eurovision Song Contest 2012 winner Loreen.

=== Voice ===
Dean possesses a mezzo-soprano range. Her vocals were described by Billboard as "raw, energetic vocals [that] cover a wide range: from club banger to melodic doo-wop/hip-hop." Dean's vocals have also been described as similar to Rihanna and Nicki Minaj. "The songwriter's voice is pitched dead center between two artists. The first is frequent collaborator Rihanna...the other is Nicki Minaj when she sings."


=== Songwriting style ===
In a 2012 article in The New Yorker, Dean described her preferred method of songwriting: "I go into the booth and I scream and I sing and I yell, and sometimes it's words but most time [sic] it's not...and I just see when I get this little chill [on her upper arm, below the shoulder] and then I'm, like, 'Yeah, that's the hook.'"
