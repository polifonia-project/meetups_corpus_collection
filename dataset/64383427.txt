== Career ==


=== Photography ===
A professional photographer, Maybury worked with prominent artist Mary Ellen Mark as well as fashion photographer Jerry Avenaim. She worked as a ship's photographer on a Mississippi River cruise ship between Minneapolis and New Orleans.


=== Comedy ===
After living in New York City and Los Angeles as a photographer, Maybury moved to Minneapolis, where she began performing stand-up in 2013. Her early material revolved around her life as a 310-pound single woman. After losing weight and becoming pregnant, she worried that her comedy career was over, but Louie Anderson encouraged her to continue, telling her that motherhood would be a rich source of jokes. Her material has since evolved to focus on family and parenthood. Since 2017, she has co-hosted Day Drinking with Mom, a standup showcase focusing on parenting. From 2014 to 2017, she was the co-host of Dead Fans Talking, a podcast for fans of The Walking Dead.
