Ashley Gearing (born May 15, 1991) is an American country music artist.
Ashley Gearing made her chart debut in 2003 with the song "Can You Hear Me When I Talk to You?", which peaked at No. 36 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts. Eleven years old at the time, she became the youngest solo artist to enter the country charts, breaking a 46 year old record held by Brenda Lee. "Can You Hear Me When I Talk to You?" was released as a single on Lyric Street Records. It was followed by "Ribbons of Love", a holiday song that was never released digitally.
At the age of twelve, Gearing sang "When You Wish Upon a Star" on Disneymania 2 and "If You Can Dream"  which was certified gold by the RIAA on Disney Princess: The Ultimate Song Collection.
Her first full-length album, Maybe It's Time, was released on the independent label in 2006. This album included the single "I Found It in You". In 2007, she signed with major label Curb Records, charting again with the single "Out the Window" in mid-2008. A second Curb single, "What You Think About Us," was given a release of July 2010. She toured nation wide. In July 2016 it was announced that Gearing had parted ways with Curb Records after 9 years together.
In 2018, Gearing began touring as the lead singer of country girl band “Farewell Angelina.” They toured worldwide and were awarded a cultural ambassadorship by the U.S State Department in early 2019 and featured on a State Department tour in Indonesia and Malaysia. The tour was intended to continue to Europe but cut short due to the pandemic.
Ashley has been apart of various music projects in Nashville as a vocalist and songwriter with BMI and still tours across the U.S and Europe prominently.
