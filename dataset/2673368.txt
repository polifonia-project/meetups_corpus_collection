Wright was born in Hyannis, Massachusetts and grew up in Cape Cod. While working in radio, he befriended Maurice Starr, who went on to discover New Edition.

== Career ==
In the early 1990s, Wright relocated to Orlando and began working as a manager for the Backstreet Boys, a vocal group put together by Lou Pearlman. To help break the group, Wright decided the Boys should first develop their act in continental Europe before making an American debut. The band achieved success in pop music-friendly Europe, eventually breaking through internationally and selling 30 million copies worldwide of their second album Backstreet Boys. While the Backstreet Boys were establishing themselves in Europe, Pearlman signed another vocal group gaining buzz in Orlando, NSYNC, at Wright's suggestion. NSYNC, duplicating Wright's European strategy, would go on to match Backstreet Boys' success with their debut record reaching the number 2 position on the Billboard 200 chart. In September 1998, the Backstreet Boys parted ways with Wright, but later re-signed with him in 2004.Wright managed Britney Spears from 1998 to 2003.
