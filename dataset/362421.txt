Fallon Bowman (born November 16, 1983 in Cape Town, South Africa) is a musician and actor from London, Ontario, Canada, best known for her involvement with the band Kittie. She is of Dutch and Indonesian descent. Since departing Kittie in 2001, Bowman has worked with Pigface and as a solo artist under the name Amphibious Assault, as well as under her own name.


== Musical career ==
At age 14, Bowman co-founded Kittie with classmate Mercedes Lander and Mercedes' sister, Morgan Lander. She played guitar and performed background vocals for the band as heard on their Spit album and the Paperdoll EP. She left Kittie in August 2001.
In 2003, Bowman came across the term amphibious assault in a Tom Clancy novel and thought it would be a great name for an industrial band. She then recorded several tracks with Pigface for the band's 2003 album Easy Listening. Her enjoyment of the recording experience led her to begin writing music again. She purchased a sequencer and began exploring the Industrial music genre. Bowman filled her basement with drum machines and synthesizers and wrote the songs that made up Amphibious Assault's debut album, District Six, released on the Social Unrest label. Bowman's former Kittie bandmate, bassist Talena Atfield, and guitarist Pete Henderson also contributed to the project.Amphibious Assault's second album was completed and originally scheduled for a June, and later, an August 2005 release. The release was postponed on both occasions, largely due to Bowman's school schedule which also caused her to miss her scheduled live appearances with Pigface. On January 10, 2007, Bowman announced via the Amphibious Assault website, that the second album, On Better Days and Sin-Eating, was finally available for purchase. The album was limited to 500 physical copies but was also made available via digital download.In 2011, Bowman founded The Grace Dynasty, a five-piece band that included Rhim of The Birthday Massacre on drums. The band played a series of live shows before announcing their debut album. After recording was completed, the decision was made to drop the band name and release the album under Bowman's name. The album, Human Conditional, was released on January 25, 2011.In November 2016, Bowman participated in Pigface's two-night 25th anniversary event in Chicago. In November 2019, Bowman joined Pigface for a concert at Toronto's Lee's Palace.In January 2021, Bowman announced the return of Amphibious Assault, as well as a new album, titled Simulacrima. The album was released digitally on February 12, 2021, with physical copies made available a few months later.In January 2022, Amphibious Assault released the single Death Ship.
