The New York Philharmonic bought Phelps a viola by Gasparo da Sal√≤ (Gasparo Bertolotti) about four years after she joined the orchestra. She uses a mix of Pirastro and Jargar strings. She had previously played a viola by Giovanni Tononi.


== Education ==
Phelps began her musical training on the violin at age four. She did not like the sound of the violin, so she  switched to viola at age eleven. She studied with Sven Reher before college. She then studied at the USC Thornton School of Music where she earned her Bachelor's degree in music performance in 1978. In 1979 and again in 1983 she attended the Music Academy of the West. Phelps went on to get her master's degree from the University of Michigan in 1984. In 1994 she received the Outstanding Alumnus Award from Thornton School of Music as "a Thornton graduate whose artistic or scholarly accomplishments both reflect the ideals of the school and have furthered the art of music." She is a faculty member at Mannes School of Music.


== Personal life ==
Phelps is married to cellist Ronald Thomas and they live just outside New York City in Leonia, N.J. They have three daughters: Lili (by Thomas' marriage to Mihae Lee), Christina (by Phelps' marriage to baritone David Malis), and Caitlin.
