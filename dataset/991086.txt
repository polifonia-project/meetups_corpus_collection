Over the Rhine is an American, Ohio-based folk music band, the core of which is the husband-and-wife team of pianist/guitarist/bassist Linford Detweiler and vocalist/guitarist Karin Bergquist. The band began as a quartet with guitarist Ric Hordinski and drummer Brian Kelley. Hordinski left the band in December 1996, and Kelley continued to play into 1997 before departing. The original foursome reunited in December 2008 at The Taft Theatre (in Cincinnati) to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the formation of the band, and again in the summer of 2010 at Ric's studio, "the Monastery", to play the album Good Dog Bad Dog live, in its entirety.
The band's namesake and place of origin is the Cincinnati, Ohio neighborhood Over-the-Rhine. Karin attended school in Barnesville, Ohio and graduated from Barnesville High School in 1984. She then went to Malone University, located in Canton, Ohio, where she met Linford. Karin and Linford were married in the fall of 1996 in Cincinnati and several years ago relocated to a pre-Civil War farm outside of town.
Over the Rhine is now primarily Bergquist (vocals, acoustic guitar, piano) and Detweiler (keyboards, electric bass, vocals) accompanied by complementary musicians on albums and tours. Over the years, they have toured and recorded in many variations.  They have shared the stage with Bob Dylan, John Prine, Adrian Belew, Squeeze, Ani DiFranco, My Morning Jacket, Hem, and toured as "adjunct" members of Cowboy Junkies.


== History ==
Formed in the spring of 1989, at a time when Detweiler, Hordinski, and Kelley were also touring as part of the final incarnation of Servant, Over the Rhine released independently their first two albums, Till We Have Faces, in 1991 (named for the C. S. Lewis book of the same title) and Patience in 1992, before eventually signing with label giant I.R.S. Records later in 1992. IRS acquired both Till We Have Faces and Patience, issuing them as the first two releases from the band, and later in 1994 would fully fund the band's third LP release Eve to rave reviews. When I.R.S. records was bought out in 1996, Over the Rhine was released from their five-album contract and went on to independently release Good Dog, Bad Dog and The Darkest Night of the Year, both of which outsold the three previous IRS releases combined. In 2001, Over the Rhine signed with Virgin Records/Back Porch and released Films for Radio to near universal acclaim before releasing double album Ohio in 2003.  Paste magazine granted one of its first five-star reviews to Ohio, released on Virgin Records' Back Porch Records label.  Over the Rhine's next album, Drunkard's Prayer, was released on March 29, 2005.
A limited edition live album titled Live From Nowhere, Volume 1 was released in April 2006.  A second limited edition live album, Live From Nowhere, Volume 2 was released in March 2007, just over a month from Discount Fireworks. The Trumpet Child and the "Live From Nowhere" series have been released on their own independent label, Great Speckled Dog (named after their Great Dane, Elroy).
Linford has also recorded and released three solo projects composed of home-recorded acoustic, piano-based music.
In January 2008, Paste's video podcast interviewed Over the Rhine and featured a live performance.Paste named Over the Rhine's The Long Surrender one of the Top 50 Best Records of the year.Over the Rhine's album The Long Surrender was released nationally on February 8, 2011, on the band's own Great Speckled Dog label. It was recorded in California with producer Joe Henry, and contains a duet with Lucinda Williams on "Undamned" and two songs co-written with Joe Henry.
Over the Rhine's album Meet Me at the Edge of the World is a double album that was produced by Joe Henry. The songs were recorded in two sessions at The Garfield House in South Pasadena in 2013: disc one, Sacred Ground, March 28–30 and disc two, Blue Jean Sky, April 1–3.  Aimee Mann appears as a special guest vocalist on the song "Don't Let The Bastards Get You Down". The album was released nationally on September 3, 2013.
On March 15, 2019, Over The Rhine released Love & Revelation, on their own Great Speckled Dog Record label. The album was produced by the band and recorded and mixed by Ryan Freeland. The first single from the album, the title track, was premiered by Paste almost two months earlier. The album premiered on Rolling Stone along with a brief article about the album and the duo's creative process. The album was met with critical acclaim from sources including No Depression and Associated Press, who wrote "Love & Revelation is a subdued but lovely celebration...It won't surprise longtime fans that the topics are often sad and the tempos mostly slow, all the better to showcase Bergquist's warm, wise, honest alto. She sounds better than ever, with a depth and richness that makes her voice resonate like a prayer."Cincinnati Pops Orchestra featured Over the Rhine in their special July 4 livestream alongside Melinda Doolittle.
