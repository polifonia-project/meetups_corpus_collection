In 1973, Christopher Cloud was an alias for Tommy Boyce of Boyce and Hart fame. He released an album called Blown Away on Chelsea Records (BCL1-0234) that same year. The band featured members of the group AIM. He also used a second alias on the record simply called "Tomme". This album has never been reissued on CD. It is to note that the last song on side A (Thank God For Rock'n Roll) is not referenced anywhere but on the actual record label. AIM released an album in 1974 called Aim For The Highest on Blue Thumb Records (BST64).
