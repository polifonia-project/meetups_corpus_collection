Josephine Roberto (born December 25, 1977), known by her stage name Banig or Banig Roberto, is an international recording artist, songwriter, actress and music producer born in Pasay, Philippines. Although she began singing when she was 3, her professional career started at the age of 8 when she appeared on Ang Bagong Kampeon, a nationally televised talent show in the Philippines. She was a 7-week champion and placed third in the grand finals. After her success on Ang Bagong Kampeon, she appeared on many other television shows and in 1989, won the International Star Search TV competition to become the Junior Category Champion representing the Philippines. This prompted her move to the United States where she has enjoyed a successful international career that continues today.
Star Search led to numerous U.S. television appearances including The Arsenio Hall Show, Into the Night with Rick Dees, The Maury Povich Show, AM Los Angeles, Good Day L.A..  She headlined solo concerts in various musical landmark venues including The Wiltern Theater, Hollywood Palladium, Mark Ettess Arena Trump Taj Mahal, City Center NY, Cow Palace San Francisco, Roxy Theatre Los Angeles, Alex Theatre Glendale CA, Spreckles Theater San Diego, Copley Symphony Hall San Diego and more.  At the age of 16, Banig released her first international album in the U.S. entitled Can You Feel My Heart on Del-Fi Records. Singles "Everlasting", "This Time It's For Real" and "I Talk to Everybody" received airplay and charted on radio stations across the U.S.  In 2001, Banig and her younger sister Jhoanna Roberto, formed their own record label, Double Play Entertainment. Under this label, Banig released the album Silent Whispers, along with singles "Boogie On the Dance Floor" and "Walk". Both singles received support from radio and club play and peaked at No. 1 on several radio stations across the U.S. Roberto continues to sing, write and produce and is currently working on new music projects while based in the United States.


== Early years ==
Josephine Roberto was born on December 25, 1977, in Pasay, Philippines, and showed an interest in music at a very early age. Her parents, Efren and Gloria Roberto, were both musically inclined and encouraged and supported their daughter's talent. At the age of 3, Josephine was already singing in school functions, town events and family gatherings. Her father recorded rough demos of her singing to be able to show off his talented daughter to co-workers while working abroad. With songs like "Paper Roses", "Mamang Sorbetero", "Fame" and "Anyone Can See", little Josephine impressed her peers, relatives and townsmen and soon had the opportunity to participate in recognized talent shows.
Josephine grew up listening to some of the greatest singers of her time including Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Gladys Knight, Aretha Franklin and Tina Turner.  These musical idols influenced her vocal style, her stage presence and her ability to perform and entertain.


== Career: 1986–present ==


=== 1986–88 ===
At age 7, her father took her to audition for Ang Bagong Kampeon, a nationally televised talent show in the Philippines.  She won 2nd place, but was determined to audition again.  The next year, at the age of 8, she won 7 consecutive weeks and made it to the grand finals.  She was the youngest contestant remaining in the competition, and had a signature growl that caught the attention of the show's viewers.  Having just lost her baby teeth, she was often teased by the show's host, the late Bert "Tawa" Marcelo, with jokes about the young contestant still wetting her "Banig" ("mattress" in Tagalog). With a powerful voice, she sang songs well beyond her years, imitating Shirley Bassey with "Big Spender", "Never Never Never", "The Greatest Performance of My Life" and "This is My Life".  She also performed Whitney Houston's hits "The Greatest Love of All" and "Saving All My Love For You" along with broadway classics "Cabaret" and "New York New York" in the style of Liza Minnelli.  The little girl with the big voice captured the attention of households across the Philippines with the stage name Banig.  She came 3rd in the grand finals of Ang Bagong Kampeon singing "The Greatest Love of All".
Banig released her very first single from WEA entitled "Makinang Kumakanta".  In 1987, she won Best Child Performer at the Aliw Awards (Philippine's version of Tony Awards).  In 1988, she won Best Child Performer at the Awit Awards.
At age 11, she released her first album in the Philippines entitled "BANIG" from VIVA Records where she introduced her first composition, Musika. In 1989 she made her film debut in Viva Films' feature entitled "M & M the Incredible Twins" for which she received a Star Awards nomination for Best Child Actress in 1990.
She continued performing in the Philippines including as the opening act for Duran Duran at the Araneta Coliseum, Quezon City, and headlined concerts including Banig Live at SM Cubao, Quezon City, Banig Live at Circus Circus SM City, N. EDSA, Quezon City, An Evening with BANIG at St. Mary's College, Meycauayan, Bulacan, That Old Black Magic, Music Museum in Greenhills, Metro Manila, and Banig Live in Concert at St. Mary's College, Meycauayan, Bulacan.


=== 1989–93 ===
Following her International Star Search victory, Roberto moved to the United States and signed a management contract with Motown Entertainment headed by Suzanne De Passe and Irene Dreayer (producer of hit T.V sitcom Sister, Sister and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody) to manage her U.S. career. She was also signed with Twentieth Century Fox to develop a television series. During this time, she made an appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show (in 1989) to promote her first solo concert at the Wiltern Theater. She sang "Get Up Get Down Get Funky Get Loose" by Teddy Pendegrass, which got a standing ovation from the audience. Arsenio Hall commented that "I can't believe that kind of voice comes out of that body." Banig was asked to perform on the show again in November 1989 and sang "Dancing in the Streets."


=== 1993–95 ===
In 1993, Roberto signed with an independent record label, Del-Fi Records, headed by Bob Keane – the same label that launched the career of Ritchie Valens ("La Bamba"). Del-Fi released her first U.S. album, Can You Feel My Heart, in February 1994. Can You Feel My Heart peaked at No. 8 on the Top 100 chart in Virgin Mega Store Los Angeles. Her singles "This Time It's For Real", "Everlasting" and "I Talk to Everybody" received airplay on several radio stations throughout the United States.
In 1994, she was chosen by Project Reward to headline a series of concerts in middle and junior high schools in San Jose and Los Angeles sponsored by the Educational Support Marketing Network to provide schools with positive reinforcement program and reward students for improved learning achievement. Students jammed in line waiting for autographs. When programs and flyers ran out, she signed T-shirts, textbooks, arms, legs and hands of students of all different nationalities.


=== 1996–2000 ===
In 1999, Roberto signed with a record label called Magnetic Entertainment, headed by Kool & the Gang's Amir Bayyan. She made several recordings that were never released. During this association, Bayyan introduced Banig to Joe Jackson (father of Michael and Janet Jackson). Mr. Jackson became an important supporter of Banig's career.  She and sister, Jhoanna Roberto also wrote and produced songs for Joe Jackson's artist, Crystal.


=== 2001–06 ===
In 2001, she released her second U.S. CD, Silent Whispers, through her own label "Double Play Entertainment".  It was distributed by Aloha Music International and was featured in Tower Records listening Stations across the U.S. The CD includes 17 tracks of soulful pop love songs with a mix of club-hitting upbeat anthems that showcase Banig's vocal range. All songs were written and produced by Josephine Roberto & Jhoanna Roberto.
The first single off the album was a crossover pop/R&B dance anthem, "Boogie on the Dance Floor" which was released as a maxi-single. It featured different remixes including an urban Atlanta flavor mix ("Ruff Party Remix") with a tongue twisting rap sequence by rapper/producer Jojo (Jhoanna Roberto). It also includes the "Red Velvet Mix", a bass driven track with overlapping dubs and intense breaks and the progressive house/trance twist of DJ Astra's "Floor x 4 Club Mix".
The second single, "Walk", was released as a maxi-single in 2006. It features urban/dancehall, house, freestyle and dub remixes. "Free-Mix" delivers an urban flavor mixing 808 sounds with rapper Jojo (Jhoanna Roberto).  "Double Play Remix" features New Jersey rapper, Struggle E Stylez. The "Tribal Theory Mix" is a Drum & Bass underground track. DJ Astra's "Dub Mix" delivers a trance mix intended for the dance floors.


=== 2010–12 ===
In 2010, she released her self-titled CD in her native language, Tagalog, with the intention of reaching out to her fans back home in the Philippines. She wrote, produced and sang on the album. Double Play Entertainment tested the waters in the United States by releasing a Tagalog dance song in the U.S. Radio market.


=== 2012–present ===
As of 2012, she is performing live once again and releasing material through her label, Double Play Entertainment, using her birth name, Josephine Roberto as well. She is currently working on new projects in the United States using the name Josephine 'Banig' Roberto. She continues to record, write and produce under Double Play Entertainment. Josephine 'Banig' Roberto also owns a marketing company that works with international artists to market their music in the U.S. On July 15, 2014 Banig released her single 'He wants to get it' on iTunes U.S. and the music video premiered on Vevo July 19.


== Family and personal life ==
Josephine Roberto is the eldest daughter of Efren and Gloria Roberto. She spent the first 9 years of her childhood in Hagonoy, Bulacan, Pasay and Meycauayan, Bulacan, before moving to Los Angeles, California. Her younger sister Jhoanna Roberto has worked as her manager, business partner, producer, songwriter, and choreographer.  Jhoanna is a co-producer and co-songwriter on all of her original compositions. She attended St Mary's College of Meycauayan Bulacan for elementary school in the Philippines.  After moving to the U.S., she attended the 32nd St. USC Magnet School of Performing Arts from fifth to ninth grade. She graduated as salutatorian in her class. She also attended Van Nuys High School, Performing Arts Magnet School.


== Voice and influences ==
Since her debut at a young age, Roberto has always been known as the little girl with the big voice. Her most obvious influences include Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight, Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey. As described by Radio and T.V. personality Rick Dees, "She's got a vocal range of Whitney Houston and Patti Labelle combined. Watch out, Whitney, careful Janet Jackson, we got a 13-year-old singing sensation." Maury Povich said, "What a voice! You're just so great. We want you to come back as the next Whitney Houston, the next Mariah Carey and better than that, the next Banig Roberto."
For over 20 years, people who have followed her career, have often praised her powerful vocal range, versatility, energetic moves on stage and her natural ability to thrill audiences with her performance.  She has been described as a natural vocalist and talented entertainer. Korean TV Host Johnny Yune said, "I got chills when I listen to you. You're not just a singer. You have 100% feeling."


== Concerts and reviews ==
At the age of 10, Roberto was the youngest Filipino artist to headline her own concerts. Her first concert series as a headliner was at the Circus Circus, followed by a concert series at the Music Museum in Manila. After moving to the U.S., her first headlining show was at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. Tito Claudio of Balita Today, said in his review of the performance (June 6, 1989), "It was a frenzied standing ovation. The crowd wanted more. There was the welcome presence of non-Filipino American guests, who moaned, rolled, clapped, even whistled and actually initiated the final standing ovation."  In 1990, Roberto headlined at Hollywood's musical landmark, Roxy Theater, in a concert titled "Jam Dancin". Other concerts followed at the Scottish Rite Auditorium, San Diego Convention Center –  was just 13 when she sang her own rendition of Bryan Adams' "Everything I Do, I Do It For You" at her San Diego Convention Center concert. Copley Symphony Hall, Cow Palace in San Francisco, Wilshire Ebell Theater Los Angeles, City Center New York, Hollywood Palladium, Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and many more.
In June 1990 Roberto performed a show at the Quirino Grandstand entitled "Iba and Pinoy". It was a free concert attended by 500,000 people in celebration of the Philippine Independence Day. In his review, Boy Abunda, Jr. (People's Tonight, June 13, 1990) said, "She was met by deafening applause. Banig ranted. She kicked, strutted, ran, wiggled, giggled, sang and conquered the multitude with her first song. Not even the rain could upstage Banig, who unknown to her mesmerized audience, was running a 39-degree fever. Banig had to be dragged backstage. People demanded. 'We want BANIG! We want BANIG!' More rains poured." During her visit back in Manila in 1990, she was also invited by Philippine President Corazon Aquino to the Malacanang Palace for a courtesy call. She endorsed Mighty Kid Shoes, a children's shoe line in the Philippines and was chosen as the endorser for Pop Cola Philippines, with the tagline of "Bilib Sila Sa Pinoy" in celebration of Banig's international recognition representing the Philippines.
