He rose to become the manager of a section specializing in Latin American recordings, before leaving in 1955 to run Essex Music, Ltd., a British firm founded by American music publisher Howie Richmond.The company quickly became successful, and Platz attracted a wide variety of musicians to use the agency, including the Rolling Stones, the Moody Blues, the Move, Procol Harum, the Who, Johnny Dankworth, Dudley Moore, Lonnie Donegan, David Bowie, and Marc Bolan. For each writer, Platz established a separate division of the company, with the artist maintaining direct involvement in its control.He also helped finance and develop stage musicals, including working with Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley on Stop the World – I Want to Get Off in 1962 and The Roar of the Greasepaint – The Smell of the Crowd in 1964.
