== Biography ==
James took up the clarinet at the age of eight, switching to sax when he was ten having spent his early teen years in New Rochelle, New York.  He became musically influenced by the R&B Motown genre and saxophonist Grover Washington, Jr. When he was fourteen his family moved to Los Angeles, where he joined a fusion band that opened for acts like Flora Purim and the Yellowjackets. Another member of this early band was John Shanks, now a successful pop producer.  James eventually received a degree in History from UCLA, but began playing music full-time after graduation. James learned to play keyboards and in 1985 he joined Morris Day's band. His R&B influence was further strengthened by seven years of touring and sessions as a sideman with Day, the Isley Brothers, Bobby Caldwell, Randy Crawford, Teena Marie and others. It was on the road with Crawford in 1986 that he earned his now-famous moniker, when his physique led a bandmate to joke "We'll have to start calling you Boney James!"In the early 1990s while on tour with Bobby Caldwell's band he met engineer and producer Paul Brown, beginning a 10-year period of collaboration. 
In 1992 he released his debut album as a leader, Trust, on the independent record label Spindletop Records. Following the record's success, he was signed by the Warner Brothers label in 1994, on which he released the RIAA Certified Gold Records Seduction, Sweet Thing and Body Language albums.
In 2000 he collaborated with trumpeter Rick Braun on an album called Shake it Up. Their duets include the now classic updated version of Hugh Masakela's "Grazin' in the Grass".  Both have appeared regularly on each other's solo albums and the two have toured internationally a number of times.

James began co-producing his records with Brown in 1997, and assumed the role of sole producer starting with his Grammy-nominated Pure album in 2003. Following a string of chart-topping albums, in 2006 James moved to Concord Records and released Shine which posted his highest Billboard Pop Chart positions to that date (No. 44 on the Top 200).  His 2009 album, Send One Your Love earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&B Performance.  His 2013 album The Beat  received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Instrumental Album.
