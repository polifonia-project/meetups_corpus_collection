== History ==
In the late 1980s Sortland started The Circus Tents, a northern California skate punk band with Matt Wedgley (The Force, Dirty Filthy Mugs, Viva Hate), Scot Pickering, Jeff Jones and Chad Cox.  The band self-released their 12-song cassette tape in 1991, followed by their EP (Hard Up) in 1992.  Both releases had songs featured in several skateboarding videos (Powell, Toy Machine).  
In 1996, Sortland formed Cigar with Rami Krayem on guitar and lead vocals, and Jason Torbert on bass.  Cigar, produced by Fletcher Dragge of Pennywise, released their debut album, Speed is Relative, in 1999 on Theologian Records.
Throughout the 2000s, Sortland performed and recorded with several other bands and producers until starting his current band E V Kain.  E V Kain released their "Clear" 7" in late 2012 and is currently active.  The most recent release from E V Kain is a split 7" record with Mike Watt and The Secondmen.
