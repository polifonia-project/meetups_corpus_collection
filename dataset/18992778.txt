== Career ==
Price was born in Birmingham. His first band were the Cimarrons, who were inspired by the Shadows. He then moved on to the Sombreros, who later changed their name to Sight & Sound and moved in a more psychedelic direction. He began collaborating with Mike Sheridan as a songwriting partnership. Price joined the Move in 1969, staying with the group for two years, including an unsuccessful tour of the United States. He also contributed bass tracks to the early sessions for the debut album of ELO, but for reasons that are unclear, none of his bass parts ended up in the final mix of the album when it was released in 1971.
After leaving the Move he signed a contract with Gemini Records; he then recorded (with Sheridan) the album This Is To Certify That, released in 1970, and a solo album, Talking To The Flowers, in 1971. He then joined former Move colleague Carl Wayne in Light Fantastic, before forming Mongrel with future Wizzard drummers Charlie Grima and Keith Smart.He joined up again with Wood in the latter's new band, Wizzard, with whom he had two British number one hit singles, "See My Baby Jive" and "Angel Fingers", as well as the No. 4 Christmas classic "I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday" (all 1973).After Wizzard split up, he joined the Wizzo Band on pedal steel guitar in 1975, but they broke up in 1978. Price has also been a member of The Rockin' Berries since 1990.
Price is married to Dianne Lee of the 1970s duo Peters and Lee. The couple tour as a duo, performing hits and new songs.
