=== Early life ===
Wayne Rhoden was born in Jamaica to Joyce and James Rhoden and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Like many musical artists, his debut performance occurred at a young age. He recalls that his first singing performance happened at the age of five, using his family and friends as his audience. On subsequent occasions he would serve as DJ for parties thrown by his parents.
Later he performed in a PTA-hosted Ash Wednesday fundraising fair at his Ewarton grade school.
He attended Erasmus High School in Brooklyn, New York, then went on to pursue a career in electrical engineering. But as fate would have it, he was drawn to his first love, music.


=== Musical career ===
In the 1980s as Rankin Don he recorded the hits
Can’t Find Me Love and Baddest DJ
and in the 90s the Real McCoy, Black Queen, and Green Card. He was later introduced to producers who urged him to 
record for the mainstream labels. He has performed at concerts
with some of reggae's well-known artists including, Gregory Isaacs, Andre, Sleepy Worder, Lloyd D Stiff, and Blacka Ranks;
Grammy nominees Beres Hammond and Freddie McGregor; and past 
Grammy winners Shabba Ranks, Shaggy, and Beenie Man.
His relationship with musician Dan Zanes was initiated by his mother, who while working for Zanes, suggested that he should meet her son and check out his talent.In the 2000s as Father Goose he was featured on several Dan Zanes albums such as Rocket Ship Beach and Catch That Train! and also released three of his own albums: Color with Father Goose, It’s a Bam Bam Diddly, and Bashment Time.
In 2008 as Don Chibaka he gave his performance on the Etcetera single Dance Like That (Remix) featuring Richie Stephens and Kevin Lyttle.
