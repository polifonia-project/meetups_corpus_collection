Ali Harter was the subject of mild controversy from her fan base for failing to deliver on a funded Kickstarter project. 148 fans funded over $12,000 for the promise of an album entitled 'Near the Knuckle' in 2013. Due to a series of catastrophic life events, the finished album was shelved shortly after its completion. In early 2019 Harter announced that her family was on the mend and that the record would be released later that year.
