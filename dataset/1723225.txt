Lætitia Sadier (born 6 May 1968, sometimes known as Seaya Sadier) is a French musician, best known as a founding member of the London-based avant-pop band Stereolab. In 1996, while Stereolab was still active, she formed the side project Monade. In 2009 — the same year Stereolab became inactive — she ended the Monade project and began to perform solo work under her own name; her current band is known as the Lætitia Sadier Source Ensemble. She has frequently performed guest vocals and collaborations with other artists.


== Career ==


=== Stereolab ===
Sadier was working as a nanny when she met McCarthy guitarist Tim Gane at one of the band's Paris gigs during the late 1980s. She was disillusioned with the rock scene in France, and soon moved to London to be with Gane and to pursue her career. She contributed vocals to McCarthy's final albums, and when McCarthy broke up in 1990, she and Gane immediately formed Stereolab.
For the first incarnation of the band, they enlisted ex-Chills bassist Martin Kean, drummer Joe Dilworth and Gina Morris on backing vocals. In 1993, the band were signed to the American major label Elektra. They were released from their recording contract in 2004. Sadier was the main contributor of lyrics, written in both English and French. In 2009, the group went on hiatus.


=== Monade and solo work ===
In 1996, Sadier formed Monade with Pram's Rosie Cuckston. The group released the singles "The Sunrise Telling" and "Witch Hazel/Ode to a Keyring" in 1997. The band's debut album Socialisme ou Barbarie: The Bedroom Recordings was released on Duophonic Records in Europe and Drag City in the US in 2003. Their second album A Few Steps More was released on Too Pure in 2004. Monade's follow-up, Monstre Cosmic, was released in February 2008 on Duophonic. She retired the project in 2009 to perform new songs under her name, and released a solo album titled The Trip in September 2010; it was followed by Silencio in 2012 and Something Shines in 2014. Sadier released the album Find Me Finding You in 2017, credited to the Lætitia Sadier Source Ensemble.


=== Collaborations and other projects ===
Sadier has contributed vocals to various groups and projects, at times along with the late Stereolab member Mary Hansen. She and Hansen had contributed vocals to various recordings of The High Llamas and to the Tim Gane/Sean O'Hagan side project Turn On, and has contributed backing vocals to the track "Go Round" on The Hair and Skin Trading Company's 1993 album Over Valence. Sadier added French backing vocals on the 1994 song "To the End," from Blur's Parklife album. In 1995, she recorded the Serge Gainsbourg/Brigitte Bardot song "Bonnie and Clyde" with Luna. Throughout the years, Sadier has occasionally collaborated with German electronica group Mouse on Mars. In 1997, Sadier sang on "Schnick Schnack Meltmade" on Mouse on Mars' Autoditacker LP, and she and Mary Hansen contributed vocals to the Cache Cœur Naif EP. In turn, Mouse on Mars produced tracks on Stereolab's Dots and Loops LP.In 2001, Sadier sang on "Sol y sombra" on Fugu's Fugu 1 LP on Minty Fresh Records. In 2002, Sadier sang the chorus on "New Wave" from Common's album Electric Circus. She sang lead vocals on "Haiku One" from Sigmatropic's 2004 album Sixteen Haiku & Other Stories which was an album based on the poetry of Greek poet Giorgos Seferis. In 2007, Sadier wrote songs with Mouse on Mars and toured with them in Italy. They have yet to record the songs for release. In 2009 the French label Deux Mille released an EP which features Sadier singing with Toulouse-based band Momotte.

She contributed vocals to "PartyIsntOver/Campfire/Bimmer" on the album Wolf (2013) by Tyler, the Creator, and "Summer Long" on the album Alexandre (2014) by Brazilian band Mombojó. She wrote the lyrics and was featured in "La Ballade" on the album Something About April II (2016) by Adrian Younge, and sang on the album I'm Willing (2016) by Marker Starling.
