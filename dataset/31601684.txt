Chep Nuñez (1964 – December 8, 1990) was an Dominican-born American music producer, editor and mixer. He reached chart success with the group 2 Puerto Ricans, a Blackman, and a Dominican (Nuñez was the Dominican); but he worked on literally hundreds of hip hop, Latin freestyle, and house-music records.
