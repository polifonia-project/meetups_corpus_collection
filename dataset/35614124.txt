His best known works are the symphonic poem Cyrano de Bergerac for horn and orchestra, and the musical comedy Le mariage de Rosine. The period 1920-1945 was his most prolific, in which he mainly wrote piano music, songs and chamber music. Afterwards, he resumed writing for orchestra. His works are fundamentally traditional, although a certain influence can be seen from the musical developments that came to be at the beginning of the 20th century.While Herberigs is mainly known for his music, he also wrote a couple of plays and about 10 historical and popular novels. He produced some 100 paintings, including landscapes and, later on, abstract imaginative works.
