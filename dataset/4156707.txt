Stephen Jackson (born 16 January 1969) is a Scottish musician and songwriter. He is best known for playing lead guitar and singing in the Glasgow-based indie band Belle and Sebastian.


== Career ==
Jackson's early musical influences include Madness, ABBA, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Depeche Mode and ABC, with his first album purchase being The Police's Reggatta de Blanc (1979). Prior to joining Belle & Sebastian, he was a member of the now-defunct The Moondials, a band that released a single on Electric Honey, a label that would later issue Belle & Sebastian's first album, Tigermilk. The Moondials experience was a pleasant one for Jackson, and it took a great deal of work for nominal Belle & Sebastian frontman Stuart Murdoch to convince him to join his group. At the time, Murdoch was playing the open mic circuit in Glasgow as a solo act, and it was at one of these performances, at The Halt Bar, that Jackson first saw Murdoch play.
In the beginning, Belle & Sebastian existed mostly as an outlet for Murdoch's songwriting. Since the band's third album, The Boy With The Arab Strap, other members have begun to contribute, Jackson chief amongst them. All of the band's subsequent full-lengths have featured compositions by Jackson, and he wrote the band's 2001 single "Jonathan David" as well as "To Be Myself Completely" for 2006's The Life Pursuit.
In 2012 Jackson, accompanied by members of the Glasgow band The Wellgreen, recorded a version of George McCrae's "Rock Your Baby" for a fundraising cd titled "Super Hits Of The Seventies" for US radio station WFMU. Jackson has undertaken several collaborative works with Roy Moller.
