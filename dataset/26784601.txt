== Ambassador of Liberty ==
The national 5 May committee declared Isis as Ambassador of Liberty for the May 5 Dutch Independence day of 2009. This honourable title allowed her to join the queen for the annual May 4 Remembrance ceremony, continued by performing five big shows throughout the country on the next day, when May 5 national liberation day music festivals are held in prominent cities throughout the country.


== Nachtburgemeester Amsterdam (Nightlife Ambassador) ==
Isis was elected as the Nachtburgermeester of Amsterdam (Nightlife Ambassador) in 2010, and served as such for its 2-year term. Her function was to monitor the nightlife of Amsterdam and to build bridges between local politicians, entrepreneurs, artists and its audience. During her term she joined, and continued to be a part of, an expert team led by Eberhard van der Laan (Mayor of Amsterdam) to approve 24-hour permits for specific dance venues throughout the city.


== Magneet Festival ==
Another result of Isis’ Ambassadorship is the realization of the Magneet festival. Magneet Festival is a crowd-sourced festival that uses an online co-creation platform in order to assist in the programming of the event, a pioneering concept in Europe.

In 2011 she joined the ‘Zevenmanschap’, a committee headed by Andrée van Es and aimed at raising awareness of tolerance and discrimination in Amsterdam. It consists of seven key figures from Amsterdam of diverse cultural and religious backgrounds.

In April 2012, Isis celebrated her 20th year in the DJ business in Paradiso, marking her overall time in the business as one of the first professional women in worldwide dance culture, as well as an important member of the Dutch nightlife scene.


== From 100% Isis to Isis ==
In August 2006 Isis decided to change her alias. When she started back in 1991, she got the name 100% Isis. After 15 years she decided to stop using it and she prefers to be called Isis ever since. What she had to say about it:

100% ISIS has been my nickname since I was sixteen years old, like Lange Frans & 50 Cent are aliases. I didn’t come up with it. The printshop which printed the very first flyer that featured me used the name 100% ISIS. And there was no stopping it ever since. I am now at a point in my career that it’s time to make my name known as more than just an artist, but also as a human being which went through major developments. I am now a grown woman and my name is Isis.
