Bill Pritchard is a British singer-songwriter, instrumentalist (guitars, keyboards), musical arranger and producer. Despite being little known in his native country he has achieved considerable recognition in France and elsewhere.


== Biography ==
Pritchard was born in Lichfield, Staffordshire. His eponymous debut album was released in 1987 on the Third Mind label, with a second following in 1988. He then signed to Belgian label PIAS Recordings, his first release for them a split album with Daniel Darc. In 1989 he released Three Months, Three Weeks and Two Days, produced by Étienne Daho, which was popular in the US after exposure from MTV for the single "Tommy & Co", which featured backing vocals from Françoise Hardy. His 1991 album Jolie was produced by Ian Broudie, and gave him a breakthrough in Japan and Canada. In 1995 he formed the band Beatitude, releasing the single "Baby in Brylcreem". He made his first come-back in 2005 with the album "By Paris, by taxi, by accident" produced and performed by French producer Thomas Deligny and released by Universal/AZ. Bill did a tour in France that did end up at the Olympia as opening band of Daniel Darc's concert. Bill has recently signed a record deal with Tapete Records and will be releasing a new album called "A Trip To The Coast" in the spring of 2014, produced by longtime collaborator Tim Bradshaw.
