As a member of The Pharcyde, Fatlip contributed to the critically acclaimed Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde as well as the follow-up release Labcabincalifornia. After the release of the Labcabincalifornia album, Fatlip was kicked out of the group, in part for leaving the supporting tour for their second album in favor of working on his own solo efforts.In the group, Fatlip could be recognized for his conversational-style delivery of his verses and for having the deepest voice in the group.

In 2005, Fatlip released his solo debut, The Loneliest Punk. It includes his single from 2000, "What's Up Fatlip?" (which was included in the soundtrack for Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and the Youth In Revolt soundtrack.) The music video for "What's Up Fatlip?" was directed by Spike Jonze. During the filming process, Jonze compiled a series of interviews with Fatlip and put them together in a documentary also titled "What's Up, Fatlip?". The album features guest appearances by Chali 2na (on the song "Today's Your Day", which is included in the skateboarding film Yeah Right!), as well as Shock G (on the song "Freaky Pumps"). The album contains songs produced by J-Swift, who was responsible for the production of The Pharcyde's first album Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde.
Fatlip appeared on MTV's Jackass sliding down an escalator rail, and this was edited into his video for "Worst Case Scenario".
