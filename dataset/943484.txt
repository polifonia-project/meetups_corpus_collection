Andy Stochansky is a musician and songwriter from Toronto, living in Los Angeles.


== Early years ==
Born and raised in Toronto, he began tinkering with the family piano at the age of five. Shortly thereafter, to stop him from making music with anything he could get his hand on, his parents bought him a toy drum kit.
By the time he was in his 20s, he had become a studio musician for Ani DiFranco. DiFranco asked him to play on her new album and, within months, he became her touring drummer. With DiFranco, Andy played 150 shows a year for seven years, until he felt it was time to start expressing himself beyond the drums.

Highlights included singles being played by NPR World Cafe. KCRW KEXP radio airplay.
