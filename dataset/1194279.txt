=== With Avril Lavigne ===
Taubenfeld considered studying at Berklee College of Music, but chose to market his band with major labels instead. When his band members chose to go to college instead, Taubenfeld recorded a demo of his own music, among others sending it to Arista Records A&R vice president Josh Sarubin, who he made his acquaintance with during his time in Spinfire. Taubenfeld received a phone call from Sarubin, who invited him to audition in New York City for the band of a new talent he just signed, a young Canadian named Avril Lavigne. He joined this band in 2002 when her debut album Let Go had already been recorded. For Lavigne's sophomore album Under My Skin, Taubenfeld contributed to the music and was credited for the music on "Don't Tell Me", "Take Me Away", and "Freak Out", the latter of which he shared the credits with drummer Matt Brann. In addition to being her lead guitarist, he took up music directing and became a close friend of Lavigne. He left the band in September 2004, when he was signed as a staff writer with EMI Music Publishing, after which he got his own recording contract with Sire/Warner Bros. Records in October 2004.Taubenfeld would continue to collaborate with Lavigne for several more years.
