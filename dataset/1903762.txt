She was the original lead singer of Jakalope.  She was asked to be a part of the band when she met Dave "Rave" Ogilvie at The Warehouse Studio (recording studio owned by Bryan Adams) where she was working reception.  After singing just one song, she was hired on to be the lead vocalist, as well as writing lyrics and melodies on the first two albums.Also known for singing the opening credits theme for Degrassi: The Next Generation in season 4 and 5.

=== Katie Rox ===
In 2007, Katie left Jakalope to pursue her own musical interests.  She summarizes her experience with Jakalope as a time where she "grew as a songwriter, a performer, an artist, and learned many a valuable lesson". Nonetheless, she felt that it was time to follow her heart and go back to her roots.
She has started a new project under the name Katie Rox. Her album "High Standards" was released on January 15, 2008, which was the start of her new career. She released her 2nd record "Searchlight" in 2009. Her live performance band includes members of Beekeeper, Sidney York, and The Matinee.


=== Sébastien & Katie ===
Katie teamed up with Sébastien Lefebvre (of Simple Plan) for a three-song EP collaboration entitled "Christmas Etc."  The two wrote and recorded the songs with Sébastien being in Montreal and Katie in Vancouver. The process was documented on a web series called "Write Here, Write There", which can be seen on their YouTube channel.


=== Nice Horse ===
Nice Horse was born when Katie went on a girls’ trip to Hawaii with some friends from the Alberta music scene, where they ended up writing dozens of songs. They decided to join together as a band, with the intention of keeping it a side project that they could only unleash at the Calgary Stampede. But within a year of forming, they were touring the country as Tom Cochrane’s support act. They decided fairly quickly that they needed to take Nice Horse seriously. They released their first EP, A Little Unstable, with producer Jeff Dalziel (Washboard Union, Brett Kissel), along with the legendary Bob Rock (Metallica, Motley Crue) on a couple of tracks. The growing buzz surrounding Nice Horse led them to be named a CMT Fresh Face Feature Artist, accompanied by a world premiere of the video for "Pony Up." Nice Horse released their aptly titled full-length debut album, There Goes The Neighborhood in 2017.
