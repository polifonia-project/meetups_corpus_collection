== Life ==
Siegfried Jakob Boris Zuckermann was born in Berlin on 4 November 1906, the son of the economist Salomo Zuckermann and his wife Martha, a teacher. His father was Jewish and had converted to Christianity when he married in 1905.He initially studied national economics at the Humboldt University of Berlin as his father wished, but also studied music at the same time. In 1927, he was accepted in Paul Hindemith's composition class. From 1929, he additionally studied musicology. He obtained a doctorate in 1933, supervised by Arnold Schering. His dissertation was Kirnbergers Leben und Werk und seine Bedeutung im Berliner Musikkreis um 1750, about the life and influence of Johann Kirnberger.As early as 1929, he worked as a lecturer at the Musikhochschule in Berlin. He was dismissed in 1933, at the instigation of the Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur under the Nazi regime. He then taught music privately. When the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 were enacted, he also lost his German citizenship which had been granted to him in 1925. He subsequently remained in statelessness until 1950.After World War II, Borris returned to the Musikhochschule in Berlin, where he was appointed professor. He established and directed a teachers' seminary. He was made an emeritus in 1972. His focus was on topics such as school music, young musicians and the popularisation of contemporary music. He composed operas for schools and fairy-tale operas, and produced radio programs of new music. He became a member of the advisory board of the broadcaster Sender Freies Berlin. Borris was chairman of the new Institut für Neue Musik und Musikerziehung in Darmstadt from 1961 to 1972, also president of Verband Deutscher Musikerzieher und konzertierender Künstler, an association of German music educators and performers from 1963 to 1972, and in a leading position in the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Musikerziehung und Musikpflege. He was a member of the Deutscher Musikrat from 1964, serving as its president from 1971 to 1976.
