Receiving positive reviews from critics, the album failed to find a large audience (the single "Where You Are" did receive attention on R&B radio, and it appeared on the soundtrack to the 1996 Bulletproof). Patterson did, however, develop a loyal following both in the U.S. and abroad.

Patterson went to work on his followup, Love in Stereo, with Jamey Jaz and new collaborators such as Van Hunt. When Love in Stereo was released in late 1999 it received better reviews than its predecessor, although the mainstream overlooked it.

Rahsaan toured in support of Stereo playing dates throughout U.S. and Europe.
Although Patterson and MCA parted ways, he remained busy, continuing to perform live, working as a session singer, and contributing to both soundtracks (Brown Sugar) and compilation albums (Steve Harvey's Sign of Things to Come), while working on his next album.


=== 2004–08 After Hours, Wines and Spirits ===
Patterson's third album, After Hours was released internationally in April 2004, garnering positive reviews. With the forming of his own label, After Hours was released in the U.S. in late October.

Further collaborative efforts followed.
Patterson's album, Wines & Spirits (again featuring collaborations with Crouch and Jaz) was released September 24, 2007, and debuted at #42 on Billboards Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, his highest charted to date and No. 45 on Independent Albums Chart. The singles released, "Stop Breaking My Heart" and "Feels Good" charted on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs both at no. 59 and the later no. 76. A close friend, R&B singer Ledisi, in which he's also featured on her album Lost & Found, explains the genius of Patterson as, "Rahsaan's greatest artistic strength is his ability to be overly honest in his recordings and in his live performances. If I had to sum him up in one word, I would call him 'uninhibited'."In August 2008, Patterson released a Christmas album, The Ultimate Gift, by November Patterson won a BET J award for Underground Artist of the year.
