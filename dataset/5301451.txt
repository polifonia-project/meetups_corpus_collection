== Breaking Benjamin ==
While with Another Path, Szeliga recorded an audition video for Breaking Benjamin playing drums for the song "So Cold". The video submitted happened to be the only VHS tape submitted. Ben Burnley was forced to borrow a VCR from his neighbor to view the tape. After Burnley reviewed the tape, the band decided he was the right guy for the job. His first official recording with the band was for the full-band version of the song "Rain" from We Are Not Alone in mid-2005, which was sent to modern radio, and later appeared on the band's cover of Queen's "Who Wants to Live Forever". He recorded with Breaking Benjamin on their 2006 album Phobia, which was released August 8, 2006. He also joined the band on their tour supporting that album.Szeliga left Breaking Benjamin in April 2013 due to creative differences with Frontman Ben Burnley and notified his fans via a Facebook post on April 22, 2013.

He went on to drum with Black Label Society until 2014 and also recorded and toured briefly with Creed front man Scott Stapp.
On 5 May 2017, Szeliga was announced as the new drummer for Black Star Riders, replacing Jimmy DeGrasso.In 2018, Szeliga announced the start of a new project, Walking with Lions, in collaboration with guitarist Kevin Hicklin of 3 By Design.

As of July 2020, Szeliga endorses Tama Drums, Evans drumheads, Paiste cymbals, and Vater Percussion drumsticks. He largely uses the Starclassic Performer Bubinga series as well as the new line of Tama's S.L.P Dymanic Kapur kit and has a tendency to put the mid rack tom to the left of his kit preceding the high rack tom, claiming that it encourages him to be more creative with his fills. His previous endorsements were Yamaha Drums, DW Drums, Vic Firth drumsticks Remo drumheads and  Zildjian cymbals.
