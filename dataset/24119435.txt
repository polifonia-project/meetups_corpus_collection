Cash Money perfected the Transform scratch (along with Jazzy Jeff) which mimicked the robotic sound effects from the mid-80s television cartoon series of the same name. He is also credited with creating the Pee Wee Herman scratch and pioneering the Chirp scratch (aka the Babuggamas scratch).In 1987, he partnered with MC Marvelous (born Marvin Barrymen) and released the single "Ugly People be Quiet" (co-produced by Herbie "Love Bug" Azor) and the album, Where's The Party At? on Sleeping Bag Records.
