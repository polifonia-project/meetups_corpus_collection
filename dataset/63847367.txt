James Cooksey Culwick (28 April 1845 – 5 October 1907) was an English musician who is most well known for being organist of the Chapel Royal and founding the Orpheus Choir, both in Dublin, Ireland. The Culwick Choral Society is both named in honour of Culwick and traces its lineage to the Orpheus Choir.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Culwick was born in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England. At the age of fourteen he became a chorister in Lichfield Cathedral where his father, also a musician, was a lay clerk. He took lessons from the then cathedral organist, Thomas Bedsmore, and was later appointed assistant organist. He subsequently took the role of church organist at the Church of St Chad, Lichfield.


=== Ireland ===
Culwick moved to Ireland in 1866, filling the position of organist at Parsonstown, King's County, before moving to Bray Parish Church in 1870 and then St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street in 1871. In 1881, he was appointed as organist to the Chapel Royal at Dublin Castle. A 1907 Irish Times obituary states that he enjoyed a "high reputation" as a teacher already at an early stage in his career.Culwick founded a private society, known as "Harmonie", which attracted amateur singers and musicians, and subsequently founded the Orpheus Choir.
He was involved in the establishment of the Feis Ceoil, and from 1913 the Culwick Cup was awarded in his honour in the choral competitions. With Sir Robert Prescott Stewart, he helped establish a branch of the Incorporated Society of Musicians in Dublin.


=== Marriage and children ===
Culwick was married twice, first to Alice Mary Harrison of Lichfield (died 1875), then to Mary Richardson, "a daughter of the late Dr Benjamin Richardson of Dublin". His children were:

Arthur Culwick (born 1873), clergyman and sometime incumbent of Crinken Church, Bray
Florence Culwick (1877–1929), conductor and choir director


=== Death ===
Culwick died at his home, 57 Upper Mount Street, Dublin, having been ill for four weeks.
