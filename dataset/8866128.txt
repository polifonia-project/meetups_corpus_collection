== Career ==
Dutch started performing as a musician in the mid-1950s, usually playing rock and roll or rockabilly standards as well as traditional music from the Canadian Maritimes. Dutch regularly played the local twin city lounge scene, notably The Wyse Owl/Eastern Billiards, The Dartmouth Inn and The Monterey in Halifax. As he began to become known as a blues artist in the sixties, he started to tour various parts of Canada. Into the 1970s and onwards, he became a very popular act and toured the country regularly, performing at the legendary Albert Hall in Toronto and the Rising Sun in Montreal.
In 1998, during his 60th birthday celebration, the CBC recorded a live tribute CD that includes performances by the Nova Scotia Mass Choir, Sam Moon and Frank MacKay. In 2004, he was nominated for a Juno Award for Best Blues album and in 2005 nominated for Best Blues album at the East Coast Music Awards.
Dutch is survived by his sons Charlie Mason and Garrett Mason, who won the 2005 Juno Award for Best Blues album.
