The single, produced by ASAP Ty Beats, features a verse from American rapper and New York City-native, Wu-Tang Clan's Method Man. It had previously been previewed at the end of the music video for ASAP Ant's song "The Way It Go". The single was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. The album was then changed to be titled L.O.R.D..It has been predicted that L.O.R.D. could've resulted in Nast being the next breakout member of the group. Originally, he was being considered for the 2014 XXL freshman class, but was not added. L.O.R.D. was expected for a 2014 release, however, ASAP Mob leader, the late ASAP Yams announced on his Tumblr account that the album was officially scrapped.


== Musical style ==
Complex said that ASAP Nast's style is deeply rooted in 1990's East Coast hip hop, omitting the trap and southern hip hop influence that some other ASAP Mob members have. Vibe called him a brash, rapid-fire rhymer. He has been credited as able to "adapt his flow to match beats of all styles and eras." His verses are usually boastful and full of multi-syllable rhyme schemes.
