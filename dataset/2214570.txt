Akira Jimbo, also transliterated as Akira Jinbo (神保 彰, Jinbo Akira, born February 27, 1959), is a Japanese jazz fusion drummer who combines electronic drum technology and acoustic drums. Aside from his solo work, he is the drummer for the Japanese jazz fusion band Casiopea and has participated in side projects with Keiko Matsui, Shambara, and Brian Bromberg.


== Background ==
Akira Jimbo began drumming at the age of 18 when he joined the Keio University Light Music Society Big Band. He became a member of Casiopea in 1980. During his solo career, he formed Jimsaku-duo with Casiopea's bassist Tetsuo Sakurai in 1989. He has also worked with Hiroyuki Noritake from T-Square in the drum-duo Synchronized DNA.
Jimbo has a drumming style which is best demonstrated in his drum videos and at his drum clinics. By using the DTX drum triggering system, he is able to play a full band sound without a backing track. Jimbo has assisted in the design of K Custom Hybrid Series of cymbals by Zildjian. His drum hero is Steve Gadd.
In 1999, he won second place in the British drum magazine RHYTHM for most popular drummer. In June 2000, he became the first Asian drummer to be featured on the cover of Modern Drummer magazine. He appeared in the Modern Drummers Festival in 2000.


== Drum setup ==

One unique aspect of Jimbo's drumming is the setup of his drums.  Using acoustic drums together with Yamaha electronic drum triggers, Jimbo is able to create a live performance with an array of different sounds.
Apart from endorsing Yamaha drums and Zildjian cymbals, he also endorses Vic Firth drumsticks.


=== MIDI Drum Trigger System ===
He claims every sound is triggered as a live performance by himself, which is true in the past as the limitation of the trigger system during that time.
As his career progress, in fact, now he did use many sequencing programs during some portions such as in intense drum solo part or some difficult arrangements.
