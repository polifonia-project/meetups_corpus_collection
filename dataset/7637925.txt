Mansour Jafari Mamaghani (Persian: منصور جعفری مَمَقانی, born 28 July 1971), better known as Mansour, is an Iranian artist renowned as a Persian musical artist based in Southern California.


== Iran's Green Movement and Nokia Club controversy 2009 ==
After the Iranian presidential election in June 2009 and protests against its results, Mansour recorded a song titled "Nedaye Eshgh". The word "Neda" in the title of this song was used as a symbolic meaning of "calling" for freedom and hope, and also it was the first name of one of the assassinated people in these protests: Neda Agha-Soltan. Mansour also participated in some of the protests that were held in Los Angeles, California.
Despite his involvement in these causes, when Mansour began promotions for his concert at Club Nokia in Los Angeles on 26 September 2009, many people criticized his decision to perform at a place with the name of the Nokia Company, which had sold monitoring technology devices to Iran's government after protests against election outcomes. Mansour reacted against this criticism, saying, "Nokia Club is owned by AEG Company and had nothing to do with Nokia" and "the people who started these rumors should respect these holy activities [protests] in Iran and stop playing games with people's emotions." Despite this comments, Club Nokia is actually owned by both AEG and Nokia, but the planning for the concert was done months before the Iran's Green Movements and Nokia's part against the protesters. Nokia was not the sponsor of Mansour's concert; the program was presented by Century Records and Goldenvoice Company.
