== Biography ==
Anders Johansson was born in Stockholm. He and his mum and younger brother later moved to Malmö after his father died in a car accident.

In 1984 he moved to the United States to join his brother Jens in Yngwie Malmsteen's band. He recorded five albums and made five world tours with Malmsteen. After that, he worked with a huge number of artists, including bassist Jonas Hellborg, Benny Jansson, and with his brother Jens (as "The Johansson Brothers"). He initially joined HammerFall on the "Legacy" tour in 1999, at first only as a session drummer but later as a full-time member.
He is co-founder of Heptagon Records with his brother, created to promote their discs, their father's and some other Swedish musicians' work.
