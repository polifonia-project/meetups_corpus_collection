KAORI. (born 28 February 1976) is a freelance Japanese voice actress and singer from Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture. She was previously employed by Contemporary Music Society and Aksent.


== Career ==
Until around 1999, KAORI. worked under the stage name Kawana Akiko (川菜明子) and then Kawana Midori (川菜翠) at an entertainment agency, but due to a merger with the agency she belonged to, she couldn't use "Kawana Midori" anymore, so she worked under the stage name Ka~na (か〜な) for a brief period. The stage name KAORI., which she used since 2000, is a portmanteau of Kawana Midori. In 2008, when she appeared in Pocket Monsters: Diamond and Pearl, she changed her stage name to Suzuki Kaori (鈴木カオリ), though she continued to use "KAORI." when singing.
She is also a member of the rock band Spunky Strider, in which she was a vocalist. As of 2012, she has stopped singing as a solo artist and with a band due to vocal cervical dystonia (spasmodic dysphonia). She had signs of vocal problems when she guest-starred as Haruka in Pocket Monsters: Diamond and Pearl.
