Jay'ed was born in 1981 in New Zealand to a Japanese father and a New Zealand mother of Samoan and Māori descent. He lived in New Zealand until he was 10, then moved to Minoh, Osaka. After deciding to become a singer, Jay'ed performed in the local Osaka club circuit. His first break into music was in 2002, when he appeared as a featured artist on a Sphere of Influence album track.
He debuted as an indie artist in 2005, with his first single "Why?". This was followed by a mini-album, Gift: Just Let Me Know, which sold over 20,000 copies. In 2008, he debuted as a major label artist on Toy's Factory with the single "Superwoman".
Jay'ed found his most success in 2009, after a duet singer Juju on the song "Ashita ga Kuru Nara," which was used as the theme song for the movie April Bride. It was a hit, reaching No. 2 on Oricon charts.Jay'ed collaborated with Infinity 16 and Waka-danna from Shōnan no Kaze on the song "Tsutaetai Koto ga Konna Aru Noni" (伝えたい事がこんなあるのに, I Have Stuff to Tell You, But). It was not successful in physical sales or airplay, but reached No. 1 on the RIAJ digital tracks chart for three weeks. This made Jay'ed the artist with the most weeks at No. 1 (6, including Ashita ga Kuru Nara's weeks); however in mid-2010 this record was beaten by Kana Nishino. Jay'ed's 6th single, "Everybody," was picked as the KDDI au CM song, a promotion giving Jay'ed his first top 20 solo single.
