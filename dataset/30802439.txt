Bergen (born Belgin Sarılmışer; 15 July 1959 – 14 August 1989) was a Turkish singer. When she was 17, she quit her job at a Turkish post office so that she could pursue her dream of performing on stage. Her personal life was influential in her gloomy sound and led to her success. Her husband threw nitric acid on her face resulting in blindness in her right eye. Despite this, she continued singing and chose to cover the blind eye with her long hair.

After her ex-husband came out of the jail, he shot Bergen six times when she was on the road for a tour to promote her last studio album Yıllar Affetmez on 14 August 1989. Bergen died at the age of 31. Her songs have been included in albums with arabesque or nostalgia concepts, and covered by several artists such as Ceylan Ertem, Ebru Yaşar, Funda Arar, Muazzez Ersoy, Işın Karaca, and Emrah.
