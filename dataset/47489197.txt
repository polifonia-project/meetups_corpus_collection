Regarding her modelling career, Hill stated that she never felt passionate about it. In an interview with NY Mag, she was quoted as saying, "It wasn't something I really wanted to do; it was something that was there, so I went after it."Hill was a backup dancer for Kanye West during his 2013â€“2014 The Yeezus Tour. She had released Experience, a non-album single at the beginning of the tour. The song was produced by Jaylien Wesley, also known as JAYLIEN.
