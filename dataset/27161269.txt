=== Kasabian ===
During the recording of Kasabian's second album, Empire (2006), Christopher Karloff, one of the band's guitarists and songwriters, left the band due to "creative and artistic differences". Jay Mehler was his replacement.
He was a permanent touring member of Kasabian, although he was not involved with most of the promotional work that the band did. While he is not credited on Empire, Jay plays on the b-sides to the singles released off the album and also features in the video for the song "Empire".


=== Beady Eye ===
On March 7, 2013, it was announced that Jay was leaving Kasabian and had joined Beady Eye on bass guitar. Mehler stayed with the band until their disbandment in October 2014.


=== Liam Gallagher ===
Mehler is currently touring with former Oasis and Beady Eye lead singer Liam Gallagher for his second album Why Me? Why Not, having released his solo debut in 2017.


== Equipment ==
Mehler uses Gretsch guitars live accompanied by Vox amplifiers, notably the AC30CC2X. He also has been seen using Marshall Bluesbreakers. He uses a Blackstar HT-Dual pedal to create his tone, with him saying the pedal is the "base of his live sound". He has also been seen using a Univibe pedal, a Boss TR-2 Tremolo, a Boss tuner and the Small Clone and Small Stone from Electro Harmonix. For Liam Gallagher's solo tour, Mehler uses a Fender Bassbreaker and a Marshall 4x12 cab. His guitars include a Gibson Les Paul and a Gibson 355.
