== Career ==
In 2009, he was acquitted from a gun charge in Clayton County, Georgia: he felt he had been given a second chance in life, so he turned his attentions towards advancing his career as a rapper. He initially signed to the independent record label Bases Loaded and released the single "Cashin' Out", which later appeared on his debut mixtape, titled It's My Time. After Epic Records label head L.A. Reid heard "Cashin' Out", he requested a meeting with Gibson to ask him to sign to the label: Gibson performed a song titled "Smilin' In My Face" during the interview, which convinced Reid to sign him to Epic.Following its re-release through Epic Records in March 2012, "Cashin' Out" achieved significant commercial success in the United States, peaking at number 36 on the US Billboard Hot 100, also reaching the runner-up spot on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and topping the Hot Rap Songs chart. The song's success has inspired many freestyles and remixes by other rappers, including Ludacris, Krayzie Bone Da Brat, Bow Wow, Roscoe Dash, c-command, Young Jeezy, Akon, Chief Keef, Fabolous and Yo Gotti, the latter four of whom appear on the song's official remix. A follow-up single, "Big Booty", was released to digital retailers on July 31, 2012. In May 2013, his new single "Another Country" was released with Future on the track.
