Lucien Leopold Harrigan (January 8, 1942 – August 18, 2007), known professionally as Jon Lucien, was a singer from Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. His parents were Eric Lucien Harrigan and Eloise Turnbull Harrigan of Tortolan families. His father was a musician whose main instrument was a three coursed Latin guitar like chordophone known as a Tres.


== Life and career ==
Born in Tortola in 1942, Lucien was raised in St. Thomas. As a teenager, he played bass in his father's band. During the 1960s he moved to New York City. While performing at a party, he was discovered by an executive from RCA, which released his debut album (I Am Now, 1970) of pop and jazz standards. Lucien said the label attempted to market him as a "black Sinatra". His second album, Rashida, contained only songs written by Lucien, with "Lady Love" receiving radio airplay. Dave Grusin received a Grammy Award nomination for his arrangements. He recorded two albums for Columbia before making guest appearances on Yesterday's Dreams by Alphonzo Johnson and Mr. Gone by Weather Report. His daughter drowned in 1980, and he spent much of the decade struggling with drug addiction. He returned to music with the albums Listen Love (Mercury, 1991) and Mother Nature's Son (Mercury, 1993). Another daughter died tragically, in the crash of TWA Flight 800, and Lucien dedicated his album Endless Love (1997) to her. He died of respiratory failure in Orlando, Florida, on August 18, 2007.
