== Life and career ==


=== Early life and career (1985–2007) ===
At seven years old, Olga Seryabkina began studying ballet. At the age of 17, she received the rank of the candidate to the master of sports, and she took part in many international competitions. From 2004 to 2006 she worked as a backup singer/dancer for the Russian singer Iraklij.


=== Serebro (2007–2019) ===
After that she joined Serebro. She was brought to the casting by her friend Elena Temnikova, who was already a band member. They took part in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 and won 3rd place.
Today Serebro is one of the most popular Russian bands. In 2007 she started writing lyrics for the group. In October 2007, there were some rumors that Olga was leaving the band because it was said she had problems with the lead singer Elena Temnikova, but that wasn't true. Max Fadeev, the manager of the band, also said that the replacement for Olga had already been found, but Olga decided not to leave Serebro.On 9 October 2018 Seryabkina (the only remaining member of the original line-up) announced via Instagram that she is leaving the group in 2019 to concentrate on her solo career. She mentioned the release of one more album with the group.
Her solo career began with the name Holy Molly at first, later being changed solely to Molly. Seryabkina had a few years' period of being both the leading singer (as well as songwriter) for Serebro and having her solo career as MOLLY. Some of her songs include: "Holy Molly", "Ya prosto lublyu tebya" and "Kill me all night long", a duet with DJ M.E.G. After having left SEREBRO, she continued to work closely with the new line-up.


=== Solo career (2014–present) ===
Her solo career began with the name Holy Molly at first, later being changed solely to Molly. Seryabkina had a few years' period of being both the leading singer (as well as songwriter) for Serebro and having her solo career as MOLLY. Some of her songs include: "Holy Molly", "Ya prosto lublyu tebya" and "Kill me all night long", a duet with DJ M.E.G. After having left SEREBRO, she continued to work closely with the new line-up.
In April 2019, she released her first solo album named "Kosatka v nebe", produced by Maxim Fadeev. The same year she released the songs: "Polugolie" (half-naked) and "Opalionnye solncem" (Scorched by the sun), which was, according to Irina Titova (a former member of the then-line-up), a song the new SEREBRO were supposed tosing. However, Seryabkina, being the lyricist, after a supposed argument between her and Titova, had decided to keep the song for herself.
In October 2019, Maxim Fadeev, the founder of the MALFA label, announced via video on the official channel MALFA on YouTube, the disbandment of the label as well as giving all the artists the rights to sing their songs, with the exceptions of 2 unnamed artists. He gave Olga Serybakina the rights to sing her songs as a solo artists as well as the songs she had sun during her years in the band SEREBRO; the reasoning for that being, as Fadeev himself said in an interview on "Alena, blin": Olga had written all of the songs in SEREBRO and had always been involved with the writing & creative process. Thus that marks the beginning of Seryabkina's solo career as an independent artist.
In February 2020, her first song as an independent artist was released and named "Chto zhe ti nadelal" and under her own name, not the pseudonym. She also announced that from now on she will release music under her real name but is likely to continue using MOLLY for her English-language projects. On 10 April 2020 Olga released her second single "Под Водой", and on 1 May 2020 the "Причины" EP.

A true excitement was displayed by the band Serebro only. They showed a real fighting capacity, for instance, Marina Lizorkina even had her motorcycle gloves with her. Lena Temnikova also came to the racing and actively supported her colleagues, but she didn't take part in the competition. Only three participants took part in the final motor-racing.
