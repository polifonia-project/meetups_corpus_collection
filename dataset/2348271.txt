Crime in Stereo formed in 2001 and recorded a homemade demo tape that same year. The band released their debut, a split with New York City's Kill Your Idols, in 2003 on Blackout! Records. In early 2004, the band released their debut full-length in conjunction with Brightside Records, Explosives and the Will to Use Them and was well received by several punk music webzines. In early 2005 the band signed with Nitro Records, owned by Dexter Holland of The Offspring. Although a four-song EP titled The Contract was released in July 2005 to finish up the band's contract with Blackout! Records / Brightside, the band released the Fuel. Transit. Sleep EP that same year with Nitro Records containing two songs from the following album, The Troubled Stateside, which was released April 18, 2006 on Nitro Records.
