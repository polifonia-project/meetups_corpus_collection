The band was renamed Gay Animals in 1980, before disbanding in 1984. Carroll stated that the band aimed to be "the lesbian Rolling Stones", but "it sounded like a very bad Fall". During this time she also produced the City Fun fanzine with Naylor.

In 1986 Miaow contributed a track to the NME's C86 compilation. In early 1987 they came to the attention of Factory Records head Tony Wilson, who released two singles; "When it All Comes Down", and "Break the Code". The band also recorded two Peel Sessions, in June 1986 and January 1987. After several line-up changes, Miaow disbanded in 1988, with Carroll going on to work with The Hit Parade.Carroll married former Big Black guitarist Santiago Durango, and embarked on a solo career.

Carroll and Albini also recorded a version of "King Creole" for New Musical Express' The Last Temptation of Elvis compilation album. Carroll subsequently moved to Chicago in late 1989. There she worked with Chicago house music producer, Vince Lawrence. Their song "Too Good To Live" was a single from the album England Made Me and the album was released in June 1991 on the Factory Records label.American band Unrest paid tribute to Carroll in 1993, with the Cath Carroll (EP) released on TeenBeat records, and used a Robert Mapplethorpe portrait of Carroll on the cover of their Perfect Teeth album in the same year.Carroll released two singles ("My Cold Heart" in 1994 and "Bad Star" in 1995) and her second album, True Crime Motel, on Teenbeat Records in 1995. In 1996 she married musician and audio engineer Kerry Kelekovich, with whom she released her eponymously titled third album in 2000, on Carroll and Kelekovich's own Lilypad label. In November 2002, Carroll released her fourth album, The Gondoliers of Ghost Lake on LTM. In 2003, LTM also released When It All Comes Down by Miaow, which compiled all of Factory's Miaow catalogue, rarities, Peel Sessions for the BBC and tracks which were never released.
In 2001, Carroll's critical discography detailing the works of Tom Waits for Unanimous Publishing's "Kill Your Idol" series was published. Three years later, the book written for Chicago Review Press examining Fleetwood Mac's Rumours was published entitled, Never Break The Chain (2004).
