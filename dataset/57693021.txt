== Early life ==
Straus was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York; they’re the child of recording engineer Oliver H. Straus Jr. and Agnes "Aggie" Mullaney. Their parents divorced while they were young. On their mother's side they’re of Irish, Italian and Polish descent. On their father's side, their great-great-grandparents include Isidor Straus, a U.S. Congressman and co-owner of Macy's, and Ida Straus; they were from German Jewish families, who emigrated to the United States from the Kingdom of Bavaria and Rhineland-Palatinate. The couple died in the sinking of the passenger ship RMS Titanic. However Straus stated in a Rolling Stone interview that they are not an heiress and did not inherit any fortune. They have also clarified this information on their social media platforms.
Straus spent much of their childhood following their father to work at his recording studio, Mission Sound. There, they learned several instruments, including bass, guitar, piano, and drums, as well as music-production techniques and insight into the music industry. Straus' inspiration in those years had come from the rock music of the bands Led Zeppelin and T. Rex, as well as Jack White. They attended high school at Avenues: The World School, a private school in Manhattan, and played volleyball.After high school, Straus moved to Los Angeles to study at the USC Thornton School of Music. However, after a year, they dropped out in favour of their music career.


== Career ==

A music label offered to sign Straus at the age of 11, but they refused to do so, because of their experience watching other artists work with a music label in their father's studio. The labels would control the artists' product, and change the feel of the music. They did not want to sign with a record label until they had a definition of their music, how they wanted to run the production and with whom they would work.In February 2018, King Princess released their debut single "1950". The song is a tribute to the 1952 novel The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith, to the LGBT community and to queer love. The song reached a wide audience when British singer Harry Styles tweeted a lyric from the song. Straus followed this with their second single "Talia" in April. They released their debut extended play Make My Bed on June 15, 2018. Later that year, they earned Breakout Pop Artist of the Year honors from Vivid Seats.In 2019, it was announced that King Princess would perform at Lollapalooza and Coachella. They played The Park stage at the 2019 Glastonbury Festival and was joined by Mark Ronson (dressed as King Princess) for a performance of their collaboration "Pieces of Us" from his 2019 album Late Night Feelings. Zelig Recordings released King Princess' debut album Cheap Queen on October 25, 2019. They produced much of the album themselves, including programming many of the instruments. In November 2019, King Princess was revealed to be the opening act for the European leg of Harry Styles' planned 2020 concert tour, Love On Tour. King Princess performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live (Season 45, Episode 7) on November 23, 2019. They released a deluxe edition of Cheap Queen on February 14, 2020. The release included five previously unreleased new songs, including "Ohio".In October 2020, King Princess released a new single, "Only Time Makes it Human", followed by "PAIN" in November. In a November 2020 interview with Zane Lowe, they confirmed they're working on their second album with Mark Ronson.In 2022, King Princess joined Kacey Musgraves on her Star-Crossed: Unveiled tour as an opening act. They also opened for Shawn Mendes' Wonder: the World Tour and Red Hot Chili Peppers.


== Personal life ==
Straus is gay and genderqueer. From early 2018 to late 2018, they dated actress Amandla Stenberg. Since early 2019, Straus has been in a relationship with Quinn Whitney Wilson, the creative director of musician Lizzo. Regarding their gender identity, they have said in an interview with W magazine, "I like being a woman sometimes. I would say 49 percent of the time I love my titties. But I'm not fully a woman. I'm somebody who falls center on the gender spectrum, and it changes day to day. It's just not in me to decide." As of late 2020, King Princess used she/her pronouns, but as of 2022, King Princess has referenced themselves as using they/them on TikTok and instagram, and on a story said "I don't care what pronouns you use for me, just stream my music."


== Public image and influence ==
Identifying as a "genderqueer lesbian," King Princess has been dubbed an icon for the next generation of young queers representing free love and radical feminism becoming an artist who has been successful, trendy, and profitable by being publicly open and out as gay. With a 823K following on their verified Instagram account "kingprincess69" where they can be seen very publicly with their confirmed girlfriend, they have come to represent a new generation of queer artists. As overtly queer and particularly lesbian love songs are out of the norm King Princess has made a significant impact on the queer pop scene. As not many have built a career off of a specifically lesbian, androgynous aesthetic they have become particularly beloved by the femme queer and lesbian community, a fan base which has embraced them as an icon despite their hesitancy to be an idol, spokesperson or face of the lesbian or queer community. Despite this public image, King Princess does not want to be confined to any box of "Queer pop" music, but rather would prefer to make it to the top of the charts with songs that happen to be about queer relationships held to the same standard as straight artists. They find "queer pop" to be troubling as sexuality is not a genre. They feel their success should be taken as the beginning of something bigger, and that we are ready for queer culture and representation to become more mainstream. Their song 1950 has particularly made an impact on pop music and queer culture with the headliner song "Cheap Queen" not explicitly about queerness but rather classic pop lyrics about a relationship. This album has raised questions of cultural appropriation or fetishization of drag as KP is pictured on the album art in full campy drag makeup, however these critiques emphasize genitalia and the physical body while drag is meant to be an inclusive deconstruction of gender.
