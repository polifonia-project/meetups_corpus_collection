She released her debut single "The One in the Middle" on April 30, 2007 and made Top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts with it. On June 2, 2007, Johns made her debut on the Grand Ole Opry. Johns' debut album, Big Love in a Small Town, was released on August 28, 2007 and peaked at No. 198 on the Billboard 200. Allmusic critic Thom Jurek rated the album three stars out of five, comparing Johns' song choices and attitudes to those of Tammy Wynette and Gretchen Wilson and saying, "This record isn't all the way there, but it's well on the way and might blow up the charts anyway. Big Love in a Small Town is an auspicious debut by a young talent." Its second single, "He Hates Me", peaked at No. 47 on the country charts.
