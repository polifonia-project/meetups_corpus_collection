== Background ==
Mikkel Kauczki Cox was born on 22 May 1991 in Aarhus, Denmark, where he was raised during his childhood. In high school, Hawkins became passionate about creating a rock band with his friends. Though the idea faded within one year. When Hawkins grew older, he faced great confusion about his future, dropping out of three different studies; where he has noted:

I was planning on making a career in quantum physics and biology, believe it or not. The very 'fabric of life' is one of my favorite topics. But music has always been my first and one true love.
After this realization, Hawkins decided to pursue a career as a DJ and music producer.
