Fortier, with no background in filmmaking, agreed to the project which eventually grew from being a studio documentary into a feature length film about the band's career up to that point titled Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie. Four years later after completing the film, Fortier went on to join Bang Tango as second guitarist alongside Rowan Robertson.After his stint with Bang Tango, he joined Chuck Mosley's band as guitarist up until his passing in November 2017 which led to him writing a memoir about his experiences with Bang Tango and Mosley.

== Film career ==


=== Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie ===

Fortier took  4 years filming and editing what would become a documentary on 80's hard rock band Bang Tango. Originally intended as a studio documentary, the scope of the film grew once original members of the band became involved and more information was revealed regarding the band's history. The film was never given an official release due to clearance issues regarding usage of Bang Tango's back catalogue of music in the film which is owned by Universal Music.Aside from the inclusion of various members of Bang Tango throughout the band's career up to that point, interviews featured throughout the film include: Howard Benson, Riki Rachtman, Chris DeMakes, Mandy Lion, Andrew Wilkow, Chip Z'Nuff, as well as an opening narration by Twisted Sister's Dee Snider.The film had one free public screening in Fortier's hometown of Chicago, Illinois with Bang Tango in attendance in April 2015.Fortier became a member of Bang Tango days later as the band's second guitarist.Fortier released the film for free on YouTube in early 2016.In June 2018, Fortier released an 11 minute deleted/extended scene from the film, which contained footage from being on the road with the band as well as more insight into how the band operates while on tour. Fortier made note that the footage was initially removed from the film due to its portrayal of the band members featured in the scenes.


==== Reception ====
Reviews of the film were positive. The general consensus is that despite its low budget, the film still manages to get its point across in an unbiased, artistic, and engaging manner while being able to appeal to not only fans of the band or genre, but to anyone not familiar with Bang Tango.


=== Thanks. And Sorry: The Chuck Mosley Movie ===
Summer 2017, Fortier was recruited as guitarist for (Ex-Faith No More frontman) Chuck Mosley's solo band. During his time with the band, Fortier and Mosley explored the idea of a potential documentary to where Mosley would be the subject.

The film is being produced by Mosley's long time manager and percussionist, Douglas Esper.In February 2018 it was announced that Thanks. And Sorry: The Chuck Mosley Movie was officially in production with a TBA release date.

As a way to hone his filmmaking skills to aid the process of creating and completing Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie, Fortier experimented with shooting and editing music videos for Bang Tango, which resulted in clips for their songs: Live Life, I Like It, Bring on the World, and Suck It Up from the Pistol Whipped in the Bible Belt album. This led to Fortier, through word of mouth, being hired to produce and edit promotional videos for such acts as: Vince Neil, Slaughter, Queensr√øche, Great White, Kix, Autograph, Lynch Mob, Vixen, Marty Casey, Les Warner, David Ellefson, Mark Slaughter, Jesse Camp, Doll Skin, A Killer's Confession, and more.After completing Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie, Fortier was in talks with Fear Factory for a proposed documentary on the band's career.
