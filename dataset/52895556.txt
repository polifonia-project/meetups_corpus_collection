== Musical style and reception ==
Duterte performs all the music on her recordings, and records in a makeshift studio in her bedroom. She describes her style as "headphone music".Joe Coscarelli of The New York Times described Jay Som's music as "D.I.Y. bedroom pop" and noted its intimate, lo-fi aesthetic. Liz Pelly of Time Out New York called her sound "mesmerizing and multidimensional dream pop that favors reality over escapism, drawing from classic pop and funk". Pelly also described Duterte's singing as "low and languid".Pitchfork has compared Jay Som's intimate sound and vulnerability to the music of Phil Elverum and Carly Rae Jepsen, and Duterte has stated that Elverum's music has had a profound impact on her own. Karaoke singing and listening to Yo La Tengo and My Bloody Valentine also have influenced Duterte's vocal style.
