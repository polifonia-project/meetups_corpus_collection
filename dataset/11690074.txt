== Career ==
Moran began his career back in 1981, teaming with his friend Albert Cabrera as The Latin Rascals. Their edited versions of hit songs spliced together enjoyed major airplay on the New York City dance radio WKTU's mix show. The exposure led to a deal from Shakedown Studios which hired the duo to restructure popular hit radio songs into viable dance club hits. Shortly thereafter, they were contracted by Fever Records to write and produce a song for one of their new acts, The Cover Girls. The result was "Show Me", a song that became Moran's first Top 40 gold record. It also helped to usher in the freestyle era of music. This opened the doors for new artists including TKA, Sa-Fire ("Boy, I've Been Told"), and Lisette Melendez ("Together Forever").Moran continues to produce music and has produced some major hits played in dance clubs such as "Put Your Hands Up", "Cafe Con Alegria", and "The Promise". He also produced "Body to Body, Heart to Heart" for Cher's Living Proof album and was nominated for two Grammys for his production of Gloria Estefan's "Don't Let This Moment End" and "Heaven's What I Feel". Another major production was Donna Summer's "You're So Beautiful", which appeared on her greatest hits album entitled The Journey: The Very Best of Donna Summer. In December 2012, Moran also released another original production with the late Donna Summer entitled "Valley of the Moon" which was recorded at the same time as "You're So Beautiful".
