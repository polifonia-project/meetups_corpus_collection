Frans Zimmer (born 5 June 1985), better known by his stage name Alle Farben (meaning All Colours in German) is a German DJ and producer. Since 2014 Zimmer is signed to the record label Guesstimate/b1 Recordings and the publishing house Budde Music.


== Career ==

Frans Zimmer was raised in Berlin's Kreuzberg district, where he lives and works today. After high school, Zimmer wanted to study art, but was not admitted to university. In the following years, he worked various odd jobs, including work as a confectioner in a Berlin café. In 2010, he began DJing in Berlin nightclubs and bars. Inspired by the artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser, he took the alias "Hundert Farben" (meaning Hundred Colours), which he later changed to his current stage name "Alle Farben" (meaning All Colours)
On 9 May 2012 he played for 30,000 people at the former Tempelhof Airport in Berlin. Since then, Zimmer DJs almost every weekend throughout Europe; he also played several shows in Tel Aviv.
In September 2013, Zimmer announced through his Facebook page that he had begun work on his debut album and in January 2014 in an interview with the German newspaper Die Tageszeitung he confirmed the album would be ready in a few months. On 15 April 2014 Alle Farben released She Moves (Far Away) featuring the vocals of Graham Candy as a prerelease and the album's debut single. The album, entitled Synesthesia – I Think in Colours as per the official cover and the iTunes download page (with some media outlets opting to use the shorter term Synesthesia album in their coverage of the release), was released on 25 May 2014 in Europe through Kallias record label and Sony Music. Its 15 tracks include collaborations with Graham Candy and Lydmor (on two songs apiece) and Sway Clarke II (on one). It also includes two bonus remixes She Moves by Bakermat and Goldfish. In 2019, Farben collaborated with James Blunt on the single and music video Walk Away.
