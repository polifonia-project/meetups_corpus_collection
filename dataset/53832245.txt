He and his family moved to Phoenix, Arizona, where he was introduced to punk music through the "gangsters" and "anarchist types" in his neighborhood. At age 13, he and his family moved to California after his father, an animator, started working with 20th Century Fox. While living in Orange County, California, he joined the crust punk band Liberal Underground as a bassist. He moved back to the Philippines at age 15 with his family.
