In the late 1970s, Plakas joined a punk band called Problem Dogs. Although she had never played drums before, she purchased a set and learned to play as the band practiced in the basement of bass player Algis Kizys's house.
In the thriving Chicago punk scene, the band played sporadic gigs at places like Space Place and O'Banion's, opening for The Bangles at The Metro. They also released a single, "City Hall/ You Are The Knife", following the departure of Kizys in 1982.  Plakas moved to the greater Los Angeles metro area in 1985.The band went through several personnel changes, with original bandmates Plakas, Rick Radtke and John Connors reforming as Pirate Radio after arriving in Los Angeles.

After witnessing her playing drums with Pirate Radio in 1987, a contact from LA Weekly informed Plakas that the punk rock group L7 was looking for a drummer.  Two months later, after Donita Sparks contacted her, Plakas agreed to join L7.Once Plakas joined the band, L7 gelled and gained in momentum.  Sparks stated “we found that sweet spot with Dee. That was a huge break for us. Because she was what we had been missing. She had the same sensibility as us: we’re punks but we’re doing hard rock.”  She was given the name "The Goddess of Thunder" by her band mates.  Plakas played drums on six of the seven L7 studio albums, including on the band's hit single Pretend We're Dead from 1992's Bricks Are Heavy.  The band appeared on the main stage of Lollapalooza in 1994.
