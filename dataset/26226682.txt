=== 2010: American Idol ===
In January 2010, Semple successfully auditioned for the ninth season of American Idol. He was put in the intro to the Chicago episode of the American Idol.
Semple said Simon Cowell was reportedly "unhappy" he did not tell his band members 7th Heaven in advance about his audition. But Fox Chicago affiliate offered to film Semple telling his band 7th Heaven and allowed them to perform together on Fox, thus giving him a fresh chance.
At the actual Chicago auditions, he sang the Bryan Adams' song "Heaven". Simon Cowell said "I'm going to pass", but the three other judges Kara DioGuardi, Randy Jackson and guest judge Shania Twain approved him going to the next round on a golden ticket.But after the broadcast, it was revealed there was an immigration snafu about Semple's residency status, and that he being in the United States on a work visa and not as a permanent resident would disqualify him from applying to American Idol that stipulates that non-Americans applying to the show should at least have a permanent residency status, not a temporary working visa permit. The American Idol producers pulled the plug on Semple continuing with the competition and disqualified him.Another former One True Voice band member Daniel Pearce had attempted a comeback less than a year earlier in 2009 on the sixth season of the UK The X Factor. Pearce was picked for the Final 24 but failed to make it to the Final 12.

With members Johnny Jannotti (formerly of Chasing the Day), Drew Jonhson (formerly of Ordinary Outcasts), Amy Jay (formerly of Cat Fight) and Charley Bredrup (Fletcher Rockwell and The JR Miller Project).
At the end of 2013, Amy announced she would be leaving the band to pursue her post grad education. One year later, the band, functioning as a four-piece, mutually parted ways with Charley Bredrup. Following interim guitarists Paulie Felice (of Lexington, KY) and Stevie Craig, the position was permanently filled by Valentine Bennett (of McHenry, IL).
SEMPLE focuses on the original music Keith Semple has been writing and recording for years, as well as new material the band is working on together.
