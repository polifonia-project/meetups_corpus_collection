== DMK ==

Schrader had been a Depeche Mode fan since he first heard them in 1987. In late 2010, as he was going through the separation from his first wife, he decided to recreate their 1985 classic “Shake the Disease” and invited his children Milah, then 7, and Korben, then 4, to participate. The video was followed by a second Depeche Mode cover in mid-2011, “Strangelove” and by a third in late-2001 “Everything Counts.” This video was suddenly picked up by news outlets and blogs around the world and it quickly went viral in late January, 2012, becoming an internet sensation.In February 2012, the band adopted the name DMK, which stands for “Depeche Mode Kids” but also refers to the initials of the band members’ names.They have been nominated for “Favorite Web Personality” at the 2015 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards Colombia, featured in MTV Iggy's "10 Colombian bands on the rise" article, and in Ultimate Guitar´s list of 10 weirdest cover bands, and their remake of “Everything Counts” has been noted by The Atlantic as one of the most transformative cover songs  and by Electronic Beats as one of the ten best Depeche Mode covers ever made.Since their viral success, DMK have been invited to perform in front of live audiences in Colombia, the United States, Spain, Poland and Germany.On March 20, 2017, Schrader was chosen to take over Depeche Mode's Facebook page as part of the Takeover campaign, becoming one of Martin Gore's favorite entries, and on March 16, 2018, he finally met Depeche Mode at a meet-and-greet in Bogotá during their Global Spirit Tour.As of July 2019, DMK have covered nine Depeche Mode songs: Shake the Disease, Strangelove, Everything Counts, Black Celebration, Enjoy the Silence, Just Can't Get Enough, But Not Tonight, The Meaning of Love and Personal Jesus. They have also released an original composition entitled "Pale Blue Dot" inspired on Carl Sagan's famous reflection on the photograph taken by the Voyager 1 space probe.On November 21, 2019, Spirits in the Forest was released in theaters worldwide, featuring the stories of six life-long Depeche Mode fans, including Schrader and DMK.
