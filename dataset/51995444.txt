== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Stomp was born on 30 September 1999 in Amstelveen, Netherlands. When he was 6, he started playing the violin. By the age of 11, he began playing the drums and shortly thereafter became interested in making music. He also developed an interest in deep house and future house when he heard "Gecko" by Oliver Heldens and taught himself how to do it by learning it from YouTube. At the age of 14, he became inspired when he 'touched' a DJ set for the first time, prompting him to download specialist software, FL Studio, and enabling him to start composing. He started making deep house music at that same age, but moved to slightly harder house, as well as future house. He studied at Herman Brood Academy, a production school in Utrecht where Martin Garrix and Julian Jordan also went to.
