=== 2015–2018: Breakthrough and Brighter Days ===
After university, Fielder was a member of several unsigned bands before moving on to mixing and producing works for others, including co-writing "Good Times" by Ella Eyre with Sigma.His debut single, "Easy Love", came about after Fielder drank a six-pack of Desperados, a tequila flavoured beer, in sheer tiredness and frustration after being asked to perform a thirty-seventh mix for a popular artist and downloaded an a cappella of the Jackson 5's single "ABC". In an interview with the Official Charts Company, he stated that the record was written on a Sunday evening out of a desire to create music for himself outside of the confines of "somebody asking me to create a song that had a certain sound to it or had to be a certain way".A video was commissioned for it, set in Los Angeles, and features Lucky Aces, a Canadian duo composed of 12-year-olds, Lucky and C, dancing to it; in the video, after meeting each other, they challenge a number of child gangs. It was directed by Craig Moore, who said that he opted to shoot in Los Angeles due to the "pool of talent that would've been hard to find anywhere else", and that his attention was caught by Lucky Aces after spotting them on The Ellen Show. Within a few days, it had been picked up by Ministry of Sound, and the song entered at number 71 on the UK Singles Chart on 4 September 2015 – for the week ending dated 10 September 2015 – based on streams alone.
