Tiffany Renee Darwish (born October 2, 1971), known professionally as Tiffany, is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and former teen icon. Her 1987 cover of the Tommy James and the Shondells song "I Think We're Alone Now" spent two weeks at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and was her biggest hit. It was released as the second single from her debut album Tiffany.
Her singles "Could've Been" and "I Saw Him Standing There", a cover version of The Beatles' "I Saw Her Standing There", followed soon after, with the former also claiming the No. 1 position on the Billboard Hot 100. Thanks to an original mall tour, "The Beautiful You: Celebrating The Good Life Shopping Mall Tour '87", Tiffany found commercial success; and both her singles and the album peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard 200 charts, respectively.
Although Tiffany's second album, Hold an Old Friend's Hand, featured a top-10 single, charted in the upper register of the Billboard 200 in 1988, and ultimately became platinum-selling, it failed to replicate the success of her debut. The 1990s saw two additional releases from Tiffany, 1990's New Inside and the Asia-exclusive Dreams Never Die in 1993, both of which failed to rekindle significant interest. Tiffany returned in 2000 with her first album in six years, The Color of Silence. Although the album received some minor critical success, it also failed to achieve any significant standing. Since then, Tiffany has recorded four additional full-length albums, including an album of 1980s cover songs, and she continues to tour.
Outside of music, Tiffany posed nude in Playboy and has guest-starred on several reality television shows, including  Celebrity Fit Club, Australia's version of I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here and Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling, and has acted in a handful of horror and science fiction films, including Necrosis, Mega Piranha, and  Mega Python vs. Gatoroid, the latter co-starring fellow 1980s teen idol and musical contemporary, Debbie Gibson.

Tiffany's father is of Lebanese origin and her mother is of Irish and Native American descent.Tiffany began singing at age four when she learned the words to the song "Delta Dawn". After her parents' divorce, she lived with her father and attended Norwalk High School during her freshman and sophomore years and then attended Norwalk's Leffingwell Christian High School.


== Music career ==


=== 1980s ===
In 1981, Tiffany debuted with country music singer Jack Reeves at a country and western venue, Narods, in Chino, California. She passed a hat among the crowd afterwards, and collected $235 in what was her first career earnings.When Tiffany was singing at the Palomino Club, she was discovered by Hoyt Axton and his mother Mae Axton. Mae took her to sing in Nashville, Tennessee, where she performed on WSMV's The Ralph Emery Show, singing Juice Newton's "Queen of Hearts" and Tammy Wynette's "Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad".
In 1984 Tiffany signed a recording contract with George Tobin after he heard her sing on a demo tape. In 1985 she appeared on Star Search with Ed McMahon, where she finished in second place overall. In 1986 she signed a contract that gave Tobin total control over her career, recorded her first studio album and was signed to an MCA contract. The album, Tiffany, was released in 1987, but the first single she released from it, "Danny", failed to chart. Following the failure of "Danny", Tobin sent Tiffany on a nationwide tour of shopping malls, The Beautiful You: Celebrating the Good Life Shopping Mall Tour '87. The tour began at the Bergen Mall in Paramus, New Jersey. Her second single, a cover of Tommy James & the Shondells' hit, "I Think We're Alone Now", became a number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 list. It remains her biggest hit.
Tiffany's ballad "Could've Been" also peaked at the No. 1 spot on the Billboard charts, in February 1988. Tiffany's modified version of the Beatles' "I Saw Her Standing There", retitled "I Saw Him Standing There", peaked at the No. 7 position on the Hot 100. "Feelings of Forever" also had chart success. Tiffany set a record for the youngest female artist to top the Billboard charts with a debut album. Later that year, she toured, with New Kids on the Block as her opening act.
In 1988, at the peak of her popularity, Tiffany was embroiled in a conflict in which Tobin fought her mother and stepfather over control of her career and earnings. This led to a court fight in which Tiffany tried to have herself declared an emancipated minor. This was rejected by the court, but the judge did allow her to move out of her mother's home, and her grandmother (who sided with Tiffany during the trial) became her temporary guardian.In late 1988, Tiffany released her second album, Hold an Old Friend's Hand, which was less successful than her first. Although it did not include any number-one hits, the song "All This Time" made the top ten. The album received positive reviews from critics, and immediately went platinum.
Shortly after turning eighteen, Tiffany left Tobin's management and signed with Dick Scott and Kim Glover, who managed New Kids on the Block, by then a successful teen pop group.


=== 1990s ===
Tiffany's career suffered as musical tastes changed in the early 1990s, swinging away from dance-pop and towards harder-edged rock and rap. Some of her fans found the new soulful, sultrier Tiffany in her third album, the urban-influenced New Inside, less appealing than earlier work. New Inside received mixed reviews from critics, and failed to chart, despite several TV appearances to promote it, including on the sitcom Out of This World.
In 1991, Tiffany participated in the recording of the song "Voices That Care", which peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100.During a brief early 1990s comeback attempt, Tiffany reunited with Tobin on the album Dreams Never Die, which spawned the singles "If Love is Blind" and "Can't You See". She headlined her own show at the Las Vegas Hilton in the summer of 1993, before breaking with Tobin once again.In 1995, Tiffany moved to Nashville to develop her career as a songwriter, and to attempt a return as a country music artist.

Tiffany stated in interviews that she explained to her nine-year-old son that it was no different from posing in Vogue or Elle, except that it showed more.
