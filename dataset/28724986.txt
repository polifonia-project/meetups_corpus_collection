Adam Berg (1540–1610) was a German printer and publisher who is best remembered for his work as a music publisher and for his publication of Catholic religious texts. His publishing company was based in Munich, and he actively published music there from 1567–1597. His most notable music publication was Patrocinium musicum which was published in ten volumes from 1573–1580, five of which were devoted to music by composer Orlande de Lassus.
