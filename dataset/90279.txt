Gene Andrusco (April 6, 1961 – March 20, 2000), better known as Gene Eugene, was a Canadian-born actor, record producer, engineer, composer and musician. Andrusco was best known as the leader of the alternative rock band Adam Again, a member of The Swirling Eddies (credited as Prickly Disco) and as a founding member of the supergroup Lost Dogs.


== Acting ==
In the early 1970s, Andrusco was a child actor who appeared in such programs as Bewitched (where he played young "Darrin Stephens"), The Screaming Woman (TV Movie), Gidget Gets Married (TV Movie), The Bold Ones and Cannon. Eugene was also a voice actor, lending his voice to several animated series, including Wait Till Your Father Gets Home, The Barkleys and The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan.


== Music ==
Andrusco formed a funk/rock band called Adam Again and become the owner of the Green Room recording studios in Huntington Beach, California. He recorded and produced hundreds of albums at the Green Room, including albums by the Aunt Bettys, The Choir, Daniel Amos, Michael Knott, The Waiting, Crystal Lewis, Jon Gibson, Kosmos Express, Plankeye, Starflyer 59, and others.
In 1987, Andrusco, Ojo Taylor and another investor formed Brainstorm Artists International (B.A.I.), which became an important label in the development of the West Coast Christian alternative music scene. Though the record label focused primarily on modern rock artists, B.A.I also released significant contributions from early rap and hip-hop artists such as Dynamic Twins and Freedom of Soul. It was also at this time that Andrusco discovered future Myrrh Records artist Anointed and went on to produce their first few albums.
In 1990, Andrusco joined the rock band The Swirling Eddies, where he was known as "Prickly Disco". The following year, Andrusco, along with Terry Scott Taylor, Derri Daugherty, and Michael Roe, formed the alt-country supergroup Lost Dogs. He also produced for soul/R&B musician Jon Gibson on the album Love Education.
Andrusco died in his sleep of a brain aneurysm on March 20, 2000 in his studio. Friends said that Andrusco hadn't been feeling well in recent weeks and complained of headaches the day before his death. Andrusco divorced singer Riki Michele in 1994, but the two remained close until the time of his death.
