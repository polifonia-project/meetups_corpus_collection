== Early life ==
Cobb was born in Americus, Georgia but raised in the nearby town of Ellaville. His father, Patrick Cobb, was an appliance repairman who was also in a rock band. Brent made his vocal debut at age 7 when he sang Tim McGraw's "Don't Take the Girl" with his father's band in a Richland, Georgia festival performance.
As a teenager, Cobb fronted a local band called Mile Marker 5 which had some regional success and opened for larger stars. At age 16, Cobb met his cousin, Dave Cobb, at a family funeral. Dave was a producer based in Los Angeles, and Brent gave him a demo CD. Dave, along with Shooter Jennings, would later fly Brent to Los Angeles to record his debut album, No Place Left to Leave.


== Career ==
Cobb recorded his debut album, No Place Left to Leave, in 2006 with his cousin while in Los Angeles. However, after some time in this period, he decided to return to Georgia.
Country star and acquaintance Luke Bryan suggested Cobb move to Nashville which, in turn, he eventually did in 2008. Initially, Cobb worked as a photo developer at Walgreens but eventually managed to negotiate a songwriting contract with Carnival Music Publishing within the year.After obtaining his songwriting contract, Cobb then went on to write a variety of songs for many prominent stars, such as Luke Bryan's "Tailgate Blues", David Nail and Frankie Ballard's "Grandpa's Farm", Kellie Pickler's "Rockaway", Kenny Chesney's "Don't It", Miranda Lambert's "Old Sh!t", as well as numerous other performers.

Cobb released a self-titled EP in 2012, and began opening for established stars such as Blake Shelton and Sara Evans, playing around 120 dates per year. In 2016, his song "Down Home" appeared on Dave Cobb's compilation album, Southern Family, alongside songs from artists like Miranda Lambert, Chris Stapleton, and Zac Brown.On October 7, 2016, Cobb's major-label debut album, Shine On Rainy Day, was released via the Elektra Records imprint, Low Country Sound.

== Musical style ==
Cobb's musical style has been described as "blue collar country" with "bluegrass-leaning inclinations." Some have noted that his sound is closer to Americana than contemporary country music. Jon Freeman of the Nashville Scene described Cobb's voice as "soft and sweet, with surefooted hints of soul." His voice has been compared to Willie Nelson, Al Green, and Merle Haggard. Dave Cobb, who produced Shine On Rainy Day, described the album as "pure rural, country, soul-filled music."Lyrically, Cobb's songs often detail experiences of rural living in a conversational tone and "the influence of his Southern raising is weaved through nearly every note and line." Writing for Billboard, Elias Leight noted that Cobb is "a laid back narrator, easygoing even when forlorn."
