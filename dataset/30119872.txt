Dmitry Smolski (July 25, 1937 – September 29, 2017) was a Belarusian composer, Honored Artist of Belorussian SSR (1975), laureate of the State Prize of BSSR (1980), National Artist of the Republic of Belarus (1987), laureate of the Order of Francysk Skaryna (2013), professor. Dmitry Smolsky was the father of Victor Smolski, guitarist of the German sympho metal band Almanac.


== Early life ==
Dmitry Smolski was born on July 25, 1937, in Minsk in the family of a famous Belarusian musicologist Bronislaw Smolski. A musical environment surrounded him from early childhood contributed to an early demonstration of his musical talent (the first musical publication of the young composer refers to the age of 12). At the age of seven, Dmitry began regular music lessons (violin), first in the Moscow Central Music School and then at the Music School of Belarusian State Conservatory, where he also started to learn composition under the leadership of a famous Belarusian composer Evgeniy Tikotski. In 1955, Smolski entered the Moscow Conservatory to the class of prof. Yuri Shaporin, but a year later he had to return to Minsk for health reasons. D. Smolski graduated from the Belarusian State Conservatory, where he studied in the composition class of prof. A. Bogatyrev (1960), followed by post-graduate studies in Moscow Conservatory under the guidance of prof. Nikolay Peyko (1967).


== Career ==
From 1962 till 2014 D. Smolski taught composition at the Belarusian State Academy of Music.
The main facts of the biography of Dmitry Smolski were illustrated in the Belarusian film "10 Revelations of Dmitry Smolski" (author T. Dubkova).


== Creative path ==
Creative path of Dmitry Smolski which began in the late 1950s is the brightest page in the history of modern music. He is one of those composers who created a completely new trend in the Belarusian music of the late 1960s – early 1970s and demonstrated a fundamentally new attitude to the art of composing. Brilliant talent and mastery in modern composing techniques (D. Smolski had a lively interest in European avant-garde of the 1960s) became the basis of a rare form of perfection in all his works. The unique author's nature of composing allows listeners and connoisseurs to talk about an outstanding “Smolski’s tone”.
Dmitry Smolski was not afraid to enter into a confrontation with the generally accepted semi-official style prevailing in the Belarusian art at that time. He created the original symphony "Oktofoniya" (1967) and chamber oratorio "Song of Hiroshima" on the poems by Japanese poets (1965). Both artworks were written in the serial technique. In those years Smolski often used elements of avant-garde style in his chamber music. We can’t help mentioning his great works with elements of humor (Concertino for violin, Variations for wind instruments and percussion). In the later works, this gentle humor turned into sarcasm with elements of tragic farce (Variations with the Belarusian mentality, 15th Symphony, parts of other symphonies, etc.).
The main theme of Smolski’s works has always been philosophical understanding of human life and destiny in a totalitarian society, the depth of psychological state of the person in dramatic situations. Each of his 15 symphonies reflects dramatic, tragic or sarcastic aspects of the complex individual experiences in the interaction with aggression or indifference of the world.
Dmitry Smolski not only created his majestic symphonies but also enriched Belarusian musical history with his operas "Hoary Legend" (based on the novel by V. Karatkevich) and "Francis Skaryna"; monumental oratorios "My Motherland" (based on poems of Belarusian poets) and "Poet" (based on the work and life of famous Belarusian poet Yanka Kupala); instrumental concerts (for piano, violin, cello, cymbals); chamber instrumental and vocal compositions. Smolski’s music was played successfully in many countries (Germany, France, Italy, Russia, South Korea, USA, etc.). The CD with the recordings of his symphonies released by the British "Olympia" was the best on the CD Contest in the USA in 1992.
Dmitry Smolski was also a wonderful teacher. He worked in the Belarusian State Conservatory (now the Belarusian State Academy of Music) more than a half of the century. During that time he has taught several generations of famous composers, winners of national awards, associated professors - in short, those people whose works create the face of modern Belarusian music.
Dmitry Smolsky died on September 29, 2017.
