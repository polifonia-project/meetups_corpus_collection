By 2007, she had sold more than 10 million records worldwide including over 5 million in the United States. In 2010, she was reported to be worth as much as £11m (though one 2003 report quoted her worth at £25m). She hosted a Channel 4 chat show titled The Charlotte Church Show.

== Background and music career ==


=== Early life ===
Church was born Charlotte Maria Reed in Llandaff, a district of Cardiff, Wales, the daughter of Maria (née Cooper) and Stephen Reed, a computer engineer. Stephen walked out on Charlotte and her mother when she was two, and she was subsequently raised by her mother. She was brought up as a Roman Catholic. In 1992, Maria married her second husband, James Church, who adopted Charlotte in 1999. She has four siblings; two younger half-brothers through her biological father, Luke and Alexander, and two older step-siblings from her adoptive father's previous marriage, Elisha and Andrew. Her musical break came at age 11 when she sang Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Pie Jesu" over the telephone on the television show This Morning in 1997, followed by her performance on ITV's Big, Big Talent Show in 1997.A request to sing "Pie Jesu" at Rupert Murdoch's 1999 wedding to Wendy Deng led to concerts at Cardiff Arms Park, the Royal Albert Hall and opening for Dame Shirley Bassey in Antwerp. Church also received a vocal scholarship to Howell's School Llandaff in Cardiff where she started in 1998, after leaving The Cathedral School, Llandaff. With help from tutors, she was able to manage both performing and school work, and said in many interviews that she was "just like every other girl her age". She left school at age 16.


=== 1998–2002: Classical career ===

As a classical music singer, Church sang in English, Welsh, Latin, Italian and French. She was then introduced to the Cardiff impresario Jonathan Shalit, who became her manager and negotiated a contract with Sony Music. Her first album, Voice of an Angel (1998), was a collection of arias, sacred songs, and traditional pieces that sold millions worldwide and made her the youngest artist with a No. 1 album on the British classical crossover charts.
Church appeared on US Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) specials. Her 1999 self-titled second album also included operatic, religious and traditional tracks. One, the soaring and inspirational Just Wave Hello, was the centrepiece of a millennium-themed ad campaign for the Ford Motor Company. The song's full-length video, featuring Church, won acclaim at the Detroit Auto Show and introduced her to new fans. The track reached No. 31 in Britain.
In 2000, she released Dream a Dream, an album of Christmas carols. It included Church's first foray into a more non classical, pop-influenced style in the title track Dream a Dream, borrowing the melody from Fauré's Pavane and featuring child American country singer Billy Gilman.
In 2001, Church added more pop, swing, and Broadway with her album Enchantment. That year, Church made her first film appearance in the 2001 Ron Howard film A Beautiful Mind. Celine Dion was beginning a concert engagement in Las Vegas and was not available to perform the film's end title song, "All Love Can Be", so composer James Horner enlisted Church and the song was rewritten for her vocal range. Church also handled other vocal passages throughout the score.
In 2001, The Daily Star (a tabloid newspaper) was mocked and criticised for featuring a picture of Church in a tight top with sexualised comments ("she's a big girl now ... chest swell!") next to a piece condemning Chris Morris' "Paedogeddon" episode of Brass Eye, a comedy spoof of current affairs shows.In 2002, at 16, she released a "best of" album called Prelude, and took part in the Royal Christmas tour alongside Dame Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, marking the end of her classical music career. Her next album, Tissues and Issues, would be a pop release.


=== 2003–2009: Pursuing pop career; Tissues and Issues ===
In 2003 Church teamed up with trance music producer Jurgen Vries to sing vocals on his track "The Opera Song (Brave New World)". She was credited on the records as CMC (her initials) as it was her first foray into pop music. The song reached number three in the UK Singles Chart, Church's second highest charting single and Vries' highest.
In 2005, Church issued her first pop album Tissues and Issues. Four singles were moderately successful in the UK with "Crazy Chick" reaching number two, "Call My Name" number ten, "Even God Can't Change the Past" number seventeen, and "Moodswings" number fourteen. Although these were released in Australia as well, they failed to reach the same level of success there. Church's pop album was released in the US through Amazon.com MP3 shop, and iTunes in 2009.
In April 2006, Church performed three concerts in Glasgow, London, and Cardiff, in venues holding between 2,000 and 3,000 people; the dates at London and Cardiff were sold out. Supported by Irish band the New Druids, Church performed a mix of tracks from her debut pop album and a number of pop covers including Prince's "Kiss" and Gloria Estefan's "Rhythm is Gonna Get You".
In November 2006, it was announced that she and Sony had parted ways. According to her publicist, this was a mutual decision reached after a series of meetings throughout the year, which were held since her six-album contract had ended. There was speculation that Church had decided to take a break from her singing career to focus on her television show. Others suggested that her pop releases' chart performance contributed to the decision. Yet another factor was her pregnancy with her daughter, Ruby Megan Henson.

In 2007, Church became Patron of the charity The Topsy Foundation UK, helping to raise awareness and funds for its work to support rural communities in South Africa, empowering people infected with and affected by HIV and AIDS, through medical care, social support and skills development.
Articles emerged in the UK press in March and April 2008 stating that she was still training classically, considering a return to classical crossover. Church has sung in religious services in Taizé. She has also performed before Pope John Paul II, Queen Elizabeth II, the Prince of Wales and Bill Clinton.
In June 2008, she became pregnant with her son, Dexter Lloyd Henson. In an interview, she mentioned she would be ready to work on more music in a few months, although she was not sure whether she would further develop her career in classical, pop, or both, as she loved both genres for different reasons. Church also mentioned that she had been working with a vocal instructor to keep her voice in check, and while she had never put a focus on her body image, she would like to get back into pre-pregnancy shape before resuming work.In June 2009, Church was interviewed for Hello! magazine, and discussed her life since having her second child. She said that she was currently in the studio, resuming work on a new album and that her partner, Gavin Henson, had been strongly encouraging her to get back to work pursuing the career that she has greatly missed since settling down.


=== 2010–2011: Return to music and Back to Scratch ===
Church appeared on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on 13 March 2010, where she confirmed that she had already begun writing and recording her sixth studio album. Church also stated that the album was of a different sound to previous ones, more mature with a "kooky" vibe.
On 4 August 2010, Church made a new track, "Cold California", available to download from her website.Church's new album, Back to Scratch, was released in the UK on 25 October 2010. The 14-track album was produced by Martin Terefe. Back to Scratch was preceded by a single – the LP's title track – on 24 October. "Back to Scratch" was originally inspired "by problems facing a family member", but Church admitted in a press release that the song now has resonance to her own personal life following her split from Gavin Henson. Back to Scratch also featured the song "The Actors", which Church performed on BBC One talent contest Over the Rainbow, and a cover of Joni Mitchell's "River".It was announced on 13 March 2011 that Church had terminated her US$3 million deal with Power Amp Music over promotional disputes. Her spokesperson released the following statement: "All I can really say, because of the confidentiality issues, is that it was in Charlotte's financial interests to do so before the agreement entered the second year of its term. This is typical for these type of deals, which are investment deals rather than record deals. I can also say that the decision to terminate the term early, which suited both parties, was made well before the commercial release of the album". A spokesperson from the record label also released a statement saying "It didn't work out with Charlotte and that's fair enough. There was no falling out. It was a mutual decision. They decided to exit the deal".
The third single to be released from the album, "Snow" was released on 11 April 2011.


=== Since 2012: ONE, TWO, THREE, and FOUR ===
On 26 May 2012, Church premiered three new songs "The Rise", "How Not to be Surprised When You're a Ghost", and "Say It's True" on BBC Radio with Bethan Elfyn.

Church gave BBC 6 Music's John Peel Lecture at The Lowry in Salford in 2013, in which she criticised the music industry for what she described as a culture of sexism that pressures female artists to project a sexualised image of themselves.Following Church's appearance at the Leveson Inquiry, she became increasingly outspoken on a number of political issues, which she has explained as growing out of her experience of Leveson as well as the Conservative victory in the 2015 general election. She is a member of media campaigning group Hacked Off.

== Personal life ==
Church's personal life and relationships have often been reported in UK tabloid newspapers, inspiring the song "Let's Be Alone" on her album Tissues and Issues. At age 15 she was criticised for remarks attributed to her by the New York Post in which she allegedly criticised "the hero status afforded to New York firefighters" in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks. She apologised for the remarks one month later, as well as at the Leveson Inquiry in 2011, stating that her comments were taken out of context. In a 2006 interview with Davina McCall, she agreed being diplomatic was "not in her nature". In November 2011, Church testified before the Leveson Inquiry about the media intrusion into her personal life stating "I've been made a caricature for so long, and this person portrayed in the tabloids really isn't me. It's not the person I am, and it's had a massive impact on my career. As an artist, I find it hard to be taken seriously because my credibility has been blown to bits."On 27 February 2012, Church accepted £600,000 in damages and costs in settlement of a lawsuit arising out of the News International phone hacking scandal. She had claimed that 33 stories about her that appeared in the News of the World were the product of illegal hacking into her family's voicemail. After the settlement was announced in open court she made a lengthy statement in which she said, "I have also discovered that despite the apology which the newspaper has just given in court, these people were prepared to go to any lengths to prevent me exposing their behaviour. They are not truly sorry. They are just sorry they got caught."The press devoted much attention to Church's relationship with her first boyfriend in 2002, model and musician Steve Johnson; her second boyfriend, Kyle Johnson (no relation), who was later jailed for possession of a large amount of heroin; as well as her third boyfriend Gavin Henson, a Welsh rugby player who she started dating in 2005. At the end of 2005, she bought a property in her native Cardiff—for a reported £500,000—which she later sold for £900,000. The couple then bought a manor with a 20-acre (8 hectare) small holding in the Vale of Glamorgan in the village of St Brides Major. The couple mentioned marriage on talk shows and in the press; they eventually became engaged in April 2010. In 2007, Church made another appearance on a British young people's rich list with Henson. They were ranked 49th-richest young people in Britain with an estimated joint wealth of £12 million.Church gave birth to a daughter, Ruby Megan Henson, on 20 September 2007, and to a son, Dexter Lloyd Henson, on 11 January 2009.

They had a daughter, Frida on August 15, 2020.
