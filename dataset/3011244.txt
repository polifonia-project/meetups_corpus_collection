Ralph Michael Saenz (born May 17, 1965), better known as Michael Starr, is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. He is the lead singer and occasional guitarist of the comedic glam metal band Steel Panther.


== Early life ==
Ralph Michael Saenz was born in Chicago on May 17, 1965. He is of Spanish and Swedish descent. He was raised primarily in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles, where his father was a college professor. He is often cited as having a Ph.D. in English from University of California, Berkeley, however, this is a common misconception, as Saenz had lied about his education to get an apartment when his credit was being checked. 


== Career ==
Saenz was the lead singer for the David Lee Roth-era Van Halen tribute band Atomic Punks from May 1994 to December 2008, where he used the stage name David Lee Ralph. He formed the band with future bandmate, Steel Panther guitarist Russ Parrish. Saenz was briefly the lead singer for L.A. Guns, singing on the Wasted EP. He also has sung for the bands 7% Solution, First Cause, Long Gone, and Nightfall (where he also played lead guitar). Nightfall was also featured on the KNAC radio sponsored Pure Rock compilation, with Ralph going under the name Michael Saenz.
Saenz appeared briefly in the 2001 film Rock Star, seen in the glass booth auditioning when Mark Wahlberg's and Jennifer Aniston's characters walk into the audition. He glares at the two before Wahlberg's character takes his turn to audition. He also made an appearance as the singing voice for the character of Jimmy Chance on the television show Raising Hope, in the episode "Burt Mitzvah: The Musical", singing the song 'Rock the Torah'.
Saenz formed Steel Panther, a parody metal band,  in 2000 with Parrish under the name Metal Shop (soon changed into Metal Skool, Danger Kitty [for a commercial], then into Steel Panther). The band has become successful worldwide, and has many celebrity fans who have performed onstage with them. 
He provided background vocals for AFI on the albums Sing the Sorrow and Decemberunderground
