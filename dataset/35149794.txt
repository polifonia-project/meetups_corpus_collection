She taught music at the elementary and middle school levels in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and Nashville, Tennessee, and led a polka band in Nashville before moving to Minneapolis, Minnesota, to pursue a career in comedy.


== Career ==
Mack describes herself as a "folk humorist," using storytelling and her strong northern-Wisconsin accent as part of her comedy, playing off of the Fargo stereotype of Midwesterners in a way that Mack has described as blending Gilda Radner and Garrison Keillor. Chris Spector of Midwest Record notes that the seeming innocence of Mack's "little-girl voice and demeanor ... gives Mack an edge. Mack's zingers hit harder since she lulls you into this place where you just don't expect it." A classically trained musician with two degrees, she often plays mandolin as part of her act. She has performed at SF Sketchfest, the Vancouver Comedy Fest, the Andy Kaufman Awards, and the Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal.
