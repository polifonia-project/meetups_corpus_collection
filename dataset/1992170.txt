Edwin Eugene Bagley (May 29, 1857 – January 29, 1922) was an American composer, most famous for composing the march National Emblem.
Bagley was born in Craftsbury, Vermont on May 29, 1857.  He began his music career at the age of nine as a vocalist and comedian with Leavitt's Bellringers, a company of entertainers that toured many of the larger cities of the United States. He began playing the cornet, traveling for six years with the Swiss Bellringers. After his touring days, he joined Blaisdell's Orchestra of Concord, New Hampshire.
In 1880, he came to Boston as a solo cornet player at The Park Theater. For nine years, he traveled with the Bostonians, an opera company. While with this company, he changed from cornet to trombone. He also performed with the Germania Band of Boston and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In the early 1900s he played with Wheeler's Band 
in Bellows Falls, Vermont. Wheeler's Band was the first band to publicly perform Bagley's "National Emblem March" in 1906.
Edwin Eugene Bagley is best known for composing marches and in particular for the famous march National Emblem.  This piece is played as a patriotic tune on Independence Day celebrations in the United States and features an excerpt of The Star-Spangled Banner. It is also used by the U.S. military when presenting and retiring the colors. A theme from this march is popularly sung with the words "and the monkey wrapped his tail around the flagpole".
Bagley died in Keene, New Hampshire on January 29, 1922.
