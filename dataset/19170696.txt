Danish Music Awards Jazz is awarded annually by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. He received the 'Jazznytprisen' in 2013.

John Kelman of All About Jazz said in 2004 about Pasborg:

Percussionist Stefan Pasborg is a young Dane who has, in the past several years, studied with artists including Joey Baron, Jim Black and Daniel Humair—and given his experience, it is no surprise that his playing is daring, although it sometimes seems barely on the edge of sanity. But through it all he demonstrates a strong command of the kit; even at its most crazed this is no random bashing.
