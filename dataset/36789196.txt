Nene Encarnacion, also known as Myzery, is a Puerto Rican rapper based out of the Bronx in New York City. He was the first solo act signed with Psychopathic Records, and released his debut EP titled Para La Isla on the label in 1998. Following his departure from Psychopathic Records, Myzery continued to release albums independently, via his own label PME. After releasing a catalog of full length projects, to include the fan favorite LP's "Bad Influence", "The Red Eye", and a tandem of albums under his Twin Gatz persona, Myzery began to re-embrace his original Psychopathic Records partnership. In 2012 Myzery returned to touring, recording, and hosting events for Psychopathic Records. This re-established partnership culminated in the 2018 release of his long awaited homecoming project, the "Para La Isla/Demon Angel" double LP.


== Career ==
Born in the Bronx, Myzery started rapping while growing up through hard times. He expressed his street life and overall mentality through his music. He was involved in the rap group Boriqua Bee-Hive under the name Rhyme Recker. Eventually, his sister Nancy married rapper Jumpsteady, and the two had a daughter together named Sammy. Jumpsteady introduced Myzery to the Psychopathic Records family, and his brother Violent J of Insane Clown Posse took an interest in the Puerto Rican rapper, and offered him an outlet for his music in 1997.Myzery's first widespread appearance with the label was a cameo in the music video for Insane Clown Posse's song "Hokus Pokus" off their 1997 album The Great Milenko. He then went on tour with Insane Clown Posse, House of Krazees, and Psycho Realm. In January 1998, the entire touring lineup was arrested at a Waffle House during a quarrel with a heckling customer, which had garnered the three acts media attention. Myzery released his debut EP Para La Isla in early 1998, and it was Psychopathic Records' first solo album not released by an Insane Clown Posse member. Myzery also made an appearance on Twiztid's (formerly House of Krazees) debut album Mostasteless, but the track ("Meat Cleaver") was cut on the reissue of the album. The track later appeared on Twiztid's rarities compilation Cryptic Collection and the label's compilation Psychopathics From Outer Space.Also during this time, Myzery appeared in the movie Big Money Hustlas as Green Willie and also was a member of the group Psychopathic Rydas as Twin Gatz. He appeared on their debut album Dumpin' in 1999 on numerous tracks. In addition, the tracks from his debut EP appeared on multiple Psychopathic Records compilations and samplers. He also appeared at the Gathering of the Juggalos and even in some matches for Juggalo Championship Wrestling (then known as Hellfire Wrestling). He was also a founding member of Dark Lotus alongside Twiztid and Insane Clown Posse, but no tracks were entirely recorded with him as a member. The initial follow-up to Para La Isla was planned to be titled simply Misery, but the album was indefinitely shelved. From 1999 to 2001, Myzery focused on a project titled The Four Faces of Nay Nay. The gimmick was conceived by Violent J, and Myzery had portrayed four different personalities for the album (Myzery, Diabloa, Dr. Giggles, and The Spanish Thug). Guest appearances by Insane Clown Posse and Ice-T was planned as well. The project was eventually cancelled, but a few tracks were released on the limited edition EPs 4 Faces and DP, inc., and the limited edition compilation 4 Faces of Myzery.
At the 2001 Gathering of the Juggalos, he had an altercation with labelmates Twiztid and Blaze Ya Dead Homie at a hotel. Violent J insisted that fighting within the family wasn't healthy, and Myzery distanced himself from Psychopathic Records. The beef was later squashed years later. During a time when he was mostly absent from his former scene, Myzery made a surprising guest appearance on Jumpsteady's second album Master of the Flying Guillotine in 2005. From 2007 to 2009, rumors circulated on the internet that Myzery had died. Apparently, a friend of Myzery had created the rumor. But the intent wasn't to fake Myzery's death; rather, it was to signify that Myzery has shed his binds as a rapper. The rumor was unvalidated and unappreciated by Myzery, causing severed ties within the crew.After the rumor was squashed, Myzery reappeared with the intent to continue rapping. He announced that his newest album was to be titled The Demon Angel, and he had made his return to the Gathering of the Juggalos in 2012. In addition, his rare underground album Love/Hate became a free download on his website, along with a recording he did for the 2004 Puerto Rican Day Parade. Also, Myzery compiled tracks that he considered most worthy throughout his career, and released it as His.Story. Myzery also started to collaborate with Psychopathic Records again. He appeared on DJ Clay's 2013 mixtape A World Upside Down: The Mixxtape, Insane Clown Posse's 2017 reissue of The Great Milenko, and a 2017 Psychopathic Records EP with various artists titled Bloody Screams of 17 (which was given away during Myzery's appearance at Hallowicked 2017 and later sold online). Myzery's comeback album The Demon Angel was originally announced in October 2010; however, 8 years later, it finally saw its most definitive iteration released at the 2018 Gathering of the Juggalos, packaged together with the 20th anniversary edition of Para La Isla. The first CD consisted of Myzery's debut EP Para La Isla, along with five unreleased tracks that were recorded during the same era. The second CD consisted of The Demon Angel in its official and final capacity. The double disc bundle was released on Psychopathic Records, as it marked Myzery's return to his former label.
Although Myzery was classified as a rapper, he described his music as "read(ing) my diary over a beat with bars."
