== Early life ==

He spent his early childhood in Queens, New York, before moving to Valley Stream at the age of nine. After graduating high school he attended SUNY Purchase College and subsequently moved to New York City to pursue music.


== :DRYVRS ==
":DRYVRS" is an episodic comedy web-series created, written, directed by and starring Dishel.

Subsequent episodes featured Tom Petty, Rosanna Arquette, Darren Criss, Seth Green, Jeff Garlin, Steven Weber, Kevin Pollak, Rodney Mullen, Jakob Dylan, Dhani Harrison, and Nick Valensi of The Strokes.

== Only Son ==
Since 2006, Jack Dishel has released three full length LP's under the name Only Son: "The Drop to the Top" (2006), "Searchlight" (2011), and the eponymous "Only Son" (2017). He has toured the world extensively opening for Regina Spektor and former Moldy Peaches bandmate Adam Green.


== Moldy Peaches ==
Dishel was the lead guitarist for indie-folk band Moldy Peaches, who rose to fame for their song "Anyone Else But You" from the "Juno" soundtrack. On their debut recording, released by Rough Trade Records on 11 September 2001, Dishel played guitar on "Nothing Came Out" and drums on both "Who's Got The Crack" and "Steak For Chicken". They later released a single for County Fair/Rainbows on which he plays lead guitar.
Known for their outlandish stage costumes and ironic sense of humor, Moldy Peaches were prominent members of New York City's anti-folk scene and achieved moderate success in the early 2000s supporting The Strokes on their first US tour. They subsequently headlined their own shows worldwide and took an "indefinite hiatus to pursue solo projects" in 2002. In 2008, six years after their unofficial breakup, the band rose to international prominence when the Juno soundtrack reached #1 on the Billboard charts.
