In an interview with The Stranger, she said "Iâ€™m just really passionate about pop music and that became a central part of my identity in high school...

Mixtape Methodology described Michete's lyrics as "gleefully raunchy" and being about "sex, magic and casual abomination".Paste defined the sound of Michete's Cool Tricks as "[combining] the minimalistic get-go of trap and Miami bass with the... fury of early Nicki Minaj", while saying that Cool Tricks 2 "flirted with more dance- and pop-oriented fare".
