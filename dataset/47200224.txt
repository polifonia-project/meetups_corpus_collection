Sol Rezza (born April 7, 1982, Buenos Aires, Argentina) is an Argentinean composer and sound designer fusing experimental electronics with immersive audio. A specialist in audio spatialisation and digital storytelling, she develops her work in virtual environments and live performances moving between art, psychoacoustics, and technology.
Her main works of sound experimentation are the creation of immersive sound environments through the transformation of field recordings, effects and surround sound. Owner of an atypical professional tour, Sol Rezza works in different areas related to sound; from live performances, experimental compositions for radio to the realization of atmospheres / environments and / or sound effects for digital media, video games, films as well as for installations. All her works have two main axes of analysis: the way we perceive time and space through our senses and how sounds influence that perception.
