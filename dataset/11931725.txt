Todor Skalovski (Macedonian: Тодор Скаловски, 21 January 1909 – 1 July 2004) was a Macedonian composer, chorus and orchestra conductor who wrote the music to North Macedonia's national anthem "Denes nad Makedonija" (English: "Today Over Macedonia"). The music greatly resembles an old Macedonian folk song, "Надежда болна е легнала" (English: "Nadezhda has lied down sick"). Skalovski transcribed the folk song and claimed it as his own.
