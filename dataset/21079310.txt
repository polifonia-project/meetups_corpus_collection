Bitch (born Karen Mould; March 30, 1973), also known as Capital B, is an American musician, actress, composer, and performance artist. Best known for her work in Bitch and Animal, John Cameron Mitchell's Shortbus, her work with Canadian folk musician Ferron, and her new project BEACH.

Bitch and Animal recorded their first album, What's That Smell? in Seattle, with Kate Wolf (Julie Wolf's twin sister) in the months leading up to the Amherst show. Their first meeting with Ani Difranco was the official release of their first album. Difranco then took the two on tour with her and signed them to her label. They recorded an album, Eternally Hard in Difranco's home studio in Buffalo, New York, finished it in Wayne Schrengohst's home studio in Manhattan, and Righteous Babe released it on September 11, 2001. Bitch and Animal went on to make two records for Righteous Babe Records, and toured extensively in the US, Europe and Canada.
