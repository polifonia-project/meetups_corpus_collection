=== 2017–2018: Eurovision Song Contest 2017 ===
On 22 November 2016, broadcaster Radio Télévision Belge de la Communauté Française (RTBF) announced that they had internally selected Blanche to represent Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 in Kyiv, Ukraine. Her song, "City Lights", was supposed to have been released on 8 March 2017, but it was instead leaked the day before. When her song was announced she jumped to the second place in the betting odds but was later lowered.
"City Lights" was accused of plagiarising the song "Eclats" from Canadian singer Alexe Gaudreault, however Pierre Dumoulin, the author of the song, denied these claims, saying that "It is obvious that there are similarities in the melody as can be found in a hundred or even a thousand current melodies". At Eurovision, Belgium were allocated to the first semi-final, which took place on 9 May 2017. Blanche received 40 points from the professional juries and 125 points from televoters, for a combined total of 165 points, placing fourth in the semi-final and advancing to the grand final. At the grand final on 13 May 2017, Blanche performed 23rd, receiving 108 points from the professional juries and 255 points from televoters, for a combined total of 363 points, again placing fourth. Following Blanche's success at Eurovision, "City Lights" spent two weeks atop the charts in Flanders, as well as two weeks at number 2 in Wallonia. In August 2018, "City Lights" was certified double platinum in Belgium, for sales exceeding 40,000 copies. "City Lights" also charted across Europe, including in France, Germany, Spain and Sweden.Since Eurovision, Blanche has won a 2018 European Border Breakers Award, which recognizes emerging artists that have achieved success outside their home country. In Belgium, Blanche won Pop Artist of the Year and Revelation of the Year at French-Belgian broadcaster RTBF's 2018 D6bels Music Awards and Hit of the Year (for "City Lights") and Breakthrough Artist at the Flemish 2018 Music Industry Awards (MIA).

On 25 May 2018, Blanche released the single "Wrong Turn". A music video was released to Blanche's official YouTube channel on 19 June 2018. It was directed by Nur Casadevall. The song "Soon" was released on 20 July 2018, along with a lyric video. On 16 November 2018, Blanche released the single "Moment", which is about "living in the present, trying to forget about any doubts and fears you have…we have to let ourselves live. If we don’t learn to enjoy the present moment, then we might regret it when it’s over...”. She also said that the song is "for all the people who sometimes struggle to connect with the present moment, who feel like they’re looking at their lives from the outside". A music video was released on the same day and was directed by Eve Mahoney. The song spent 14 weeks in the top 50 in Wallonia, peaking at number 22, making it Blanche's highest-peaking single since "City Lights". A piano version of "Moment" was released on 14 December 2018. Blanche appeared three times on Wiwibloggs' list of the best songs of 2018 by artists who have participated in the Eurovision Song Contest: with "Moment" at number 7, "Soon" at number 21 and "Wrong Turn" at number 43.On 30 January 2020, Blanche announced that the single "Empire" would be released on 14 February 2020. The song was released a day earlier, on 13 February 2020. "Empire" is about people who wear shields to shield themselves from all emotions and ultimately deceive themselves. A music video for the song premiered on the same day on Complex. The video was directed by Valéry Joseph and filmed at Studio Stories in Ghent. The video's imagery was inspired by surrealist paintings, particularly those of Gertrude Abercrombie. In the video, there is limited movement, instead it relies on bold outfits, colours and lighting to express an emotional message of "fear, power, abandonment, pain, introversion, self-unveiling, trust and authenticity". Blanche started writing the song in her studio in Brussels in November 2017, but the song continued to evolve with the involvement of new collaborators, until it was completed in March 2019. On 14 February 2020, Blanche announced that her debut album, titled Empire would be released on 24 April 2020. The single "Fences" was premiered on Clash on 26 March 2020, before being released the following day. On 1 April 2020, Blanche announced that the release of her debut album would be delayed until 29 May 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 8 May 2020, Blanche released the single "1, 2, Miss You". The song is included on the album Empire along with the previous singles "Soon", "Empire" and "Fences". Empire debuted and peaked at number 7 in Wallonia, and at number 22 in Flanders. On 26 June 2020, "Till We Collide" was released as the album's fourth single. On 28 August 2020, "Summer Nights" was released as the fifth single from Empire.
