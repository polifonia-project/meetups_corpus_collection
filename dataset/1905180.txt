Black Ox Orkestar was a quartet of musicians from Montreal, Quebec who played European Jewish folk music.

They formed in the summer of 2000 to explore their common Jewish heritage through music, which was entirely acoustic and sung in Yiddish. Constellation Records released their first album, Ver Tanzt?, in 2004. They played their last show in 2005. Their final album, Nisht Azoy, was released in 2006 and recorded in Montreal's Hotel2Tango studio)
