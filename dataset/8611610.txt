== Legal issues ==
Drängarna's greatest hit song, "Vill du bli min fru", was subject to some controversy in 2002, when it was decided by the Supreme Court of Sweden that an eight-bar violin part was plagiarized from a song by the group Landslaget. This was the first copyright infringement case tried in Sweden. As a result, Drängarna's label Regatta was forced to pay damages and courtroom costs.
